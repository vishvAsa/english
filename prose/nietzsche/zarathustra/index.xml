      <description>&lt;p&gt;HOW ZARATHUSTRA CAME INTO BEING.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Zarathustra&amp;rdquo; is my brother’s most personal work; it is the history of his most individual experiences, of his friendships, ideals, raptures, bitterest disappointments and sorrows. Above it all, however, there soars, transfiguring it, the image of his greatest hopes and remotest aims. My brother had the figure of Zarathustra in his mind from his very earliest youth: he once told me that even as a child he had dreamt of him. At different periods in his life, he would call this haunter of his dreams by different names; &amp;ldquo;but in the end,&amp;rdquo; he declares in a note on the subject, &amp;ldquo;I had to do a PERSIAN the honour of identifying him with this creature of my fancy. Persians were the first to take a broad and comprehensive view of history. Every series of evolutions, according to them, was presided over by a prophet; and every prophet had his &amp;lsquo;Hazar,&amp;rsquo;—his dynasty of a thousand years.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;zarathustras-prologue&#34;&gt;ZARATHUSTRA’S PROLOGUE.&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;1&#34;&gt;1.&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When Zarathustra was thirty years old, he left his home and the lake of his home, and went into the mountains. There he enjoyed his spirit and solitude, and for ten years did not weary of it. But at last his heart changed,—and rising one morning with the rosy dawn, he went before the sun, and spake thus unto it:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Thou great star! What would be thy happiness if thou hadst not those for whom thou shinest!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;—and only when ye have all denied me, will I return unto you.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Verily, with other eyes, my brethren, shall I then seek my lost ones; with another love shall I then love you.&amp;quot;—ZARATHUSTRA, I., &amp;ldquo;The Bestowing Virtue.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;xxiii&#34;&gt;XXIII&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-child-with-the-mirror&#34;&gt;THE CHILD WITH THE MIRROR.&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;After this Zarathustra returned again into the mountains to the solitude of his cave, and withdrew himself from men, waiting like a sower who hath scattered his seed. His soul, however, became impatient and full of longing for those whom he loved: because he had still much to give them. For this is hardest of all: to close the open hand out of love, and keep modest as a giver.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;THIRD PART.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Ye look aloft when ye long for exaltation, and I look downward because I am exalted.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Who among you can at the same time laugh and be exalted?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;He who climbeth on the highest mountains, laugheth at all tragic plays and tragic realities.&amp;quot;—ZARATHUSTRA, I., &amp;ldquo;Reading and Writing.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;xlv&#34;&gt;XLV&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-wanderer&#34;&gt;THE WANDERER.&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Then, when it was about midnight, Zarathustra went his way over the ridge of the isle, that he might arrive early in the morning at the other coast; because there he meant to embark. For there was a good roadstead there, in which foreign ships also liked to anchor: those ships took many people with them, who wished to cross over from the Happy Isles. So when Zarathustra thus ascended the mountain, he thought on the way of his many solitary wanderings from youth onwards, and how many mountains and ridges and summits he had already climbed.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;FOURTH AND LAST PART.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Ah, where in the world have there been greater follies than with the pitiful? And what in the world hath caused more suffering than the follies of the pitiful?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Woe unto all loving ones who have not an elevation which is above their pity!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Thus spake the devil unto me, once on a time: &amp;ldquo;Even God hath his hell: it is his love for man.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;</description>
