This “bearer of glad tidings” died as he lived and *taught*—*not* to “save mankind,” but to show mankind how to live. It was a *way of life* that he bequeathed to man: his demeanour before the judges, before the officers, before his accusers—his demeanour on the *cross*. He does not resist; he does not defend his rights; he makes no effort to ward off the most extreme penalty—more, *he invites it*.... And he prays, suffers and loves *with* those, *in* those, who do him evil.... *Not* to defend one’s self, *not* to show anger, *not* to lay blames.... On the contrary, to submit even to the Evil One—to *love* him....
