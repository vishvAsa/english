*Growth after death.* – Those audacious little words about moral matters that Fontenelle threw out in his immortal *Dialogues of the Dead*37 were considered in his time to be paradoxes and games of a not wholly innocent wit; even the highest judges of taste and of the mind saw nothing more in it – indeed, maybe not even Fontenelle himself. Now something incredible transpires: these thoughts become truths\! Science proves them\! The game gets serious\! And we read these dialogues with a different feeling than Voltaire38 and Helvétius39 read them, and involuntarily we promote their creators to a different and *much higher* rank of mind than they did. Rightly? Wrongly?
