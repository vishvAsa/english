*A word to the philologists.* – That there are books so valuable and regal that entire generations of scholars are well employed when, through their efforts, these books are preserved in a pure and intelligible state – philology exists to reinforce this faith again and again. It presupposes that there is no dearth of those rare human beings \(even if one doesn’t see them right away\) who really know how to use such valuable books – probably those who themselves write or could write such books. I mean that philology presupposes a noble faith – that for the sake of a few who always ‘will come’ but are not there, a very great deal of painstaking, even unclean work first needs to be done: it is all work *in usum Delphinorum*.68
