*Now and formerly.* – What do all our art of artworks matter if we lose that higher art, the art of festivals\! Formerly, all artworks were displayed on the great festival road of humanity, as commemorations and memorials of high and happy moments. Now one uses artworks to lure poor, exhausted, and sick human beings to the side of humanity’s road of suffering for a short lascivious moment; one offers them a little intoxication and madness.
