*Capacity for revenge.* – That someone cannot defend himself and therefore also does not want to – this is not enough to disgrace him in our eyes; but we have a low regard for anyone who has neither the capacity nor the good will for revenge – regardless of whether it is a man or a woman. Would a woman be able to hold us \(or ‘enthrall’ us, as they say\) if we did not consider her able under certain circumstances to wield a dagger deftly \(any kind of dagger\) *against* us? Or against herself – which in certain cases would be the more severe revenge \(Chinese revenge\).
