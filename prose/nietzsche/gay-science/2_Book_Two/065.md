*Devotion.* – There are noble women with a certain poverty of spirit who know no other way to *express* their deepest devotion than to offer their virtue and sense of shame: it is what they hold as their highest possession. And often this gift is accepted without incurring as profound an obligation as the donors suppose – a very melancholy story\!
