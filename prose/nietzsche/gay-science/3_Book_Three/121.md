*Life not an argument.* – We have arranged for ourselves a world in which we are able to live – by positing bodies, lines, planes, causes and effects, motion and rest, form and content; without these articles of faith no one could endure living\! But that does not prove them. Life is not an argument; the conditions of life might include error.
