*The road to happiness.* – A wise man asked a fool what the road to happiness is. The latter replied without delay, like someone being asked the way to the nearest town: ‘Admire yourself and live on the street\!’ ‘Stop,’ replied the sage, ‘you are asking too much; it is quite enough to admire oneself\!’ The fool countered: ‘But how can one constantly admire without constantly feeling contempt?’
