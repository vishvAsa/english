*Christ’s error.* – The founder of Christianity thought that there was nothing from which men suffered more than their sins. That was his error – the error of one who felt himself free of sin and who lacked experience of it\! Thus his soul filled itself with that wonderful fantastic compassion for a torment that was rarely a very great torment even among his people, who invented sin\! But the Christians have found a way of retroactively vindicating their master and of sanctifying his error into ‘truth’.
