*Homo poeta.*27 – ‘I myself, who most single-handedly made this tragedy of tragedies, insofar as it is finished; I, having first tied the knot of morality into existence and drawn it so tight that only a god can loosen it – which is what Horace demands\!28 – I myself have now in the fourth act slain all gods, out of morality\! What is now to become of the fifth act? From where shall I take the tragic solution? Should I start considering a comic solution?’
