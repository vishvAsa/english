*The sigh of the one who comes to know.* – ‘Oh, my greed\! In this soul there dwells no selflessness but rather an all-desiring self that would like, as it were, to see with the eyes and seize with the hands of many individuals – a self that would like to bring back the entire past, that wants to lose nothing it could possibly possess\! Oh, this flame of my greed\! Oh, that I might be reborn into a hundred beings\!’ – Whoever does not know this sigh from experience does not know the passion of coming to know.
