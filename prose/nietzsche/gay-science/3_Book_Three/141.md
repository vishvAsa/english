*Too oriental.* – What? A god who loves men provided that they believe in him and who casts evil gazes and threats at anyone who does not believe in this love? What? A love hemmed in by conditions as the feeling of an almighty god? A love that has not even mastered the feeling of honour and roused vengefulness? How oriental this all is\! ‘If I love you, what does that concern you?’19 is surely a sufficient critique of all of Christianity.
