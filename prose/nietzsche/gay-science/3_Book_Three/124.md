*In the horizon of the infinite.* – We have forsaken the land and gone to sea\! We have destroyed the bridge behind us – more so, we have demolished the land behind us\! Now, little ship, look out\! Beside you is the ocean; it is true, it does not always roar, and at times it lies there like silk and gold and dreams of goodness. But there will be hours when you realize that it is infinite and that there is nothing more awesome than infinity. Oh, the poor bird that has felt free and now strikes against the walls of this cage\! Woe, when homesickness for the land overcomes you, as if there had been more *freedom* there – and there is no more ‘land’\!
