*Where reformations arise.* – At the time of the great corruption of the Church, the Church in Germany was the least corrupt; that is why the Reformation occurred *here,* as a sign that even the beginnings of corruption were felt to be intolerable. For relatively speaking, no people has ever been more Christian than the Germans at the time of Luther; their Christian culture was ready to burst into a hundredfold splendour of blossoms – only one more night was needed, but this brought the storm that put an end to everything.
