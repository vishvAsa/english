*With the crowd.* – So far he is still running with the crowd and singing its praises, but one day he will become its opponent\! For he is following it thinking that this will give his laziness full play, and he has not yet discovered that the crowd is not lazy enough for him\! That it always pushes ahead\! That it allows no one to stand still\! – And he so much likes to stand still\!
