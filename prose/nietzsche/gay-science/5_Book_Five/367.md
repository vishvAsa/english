*The first distinction to draw regarding artworks.* – Everything that is thought, written, painted, composed, even built and sculpted, belongs either to monologue art or to art before witnesses. The second category must also include the seemingly monologue art involving faith in God, the entire lyricism of prayer; for solitude does not yet exist to the pious – this invention was first made by us, the godless. I know no deeper distinction in an artist’s entire optics than this: whether he views his budding artwork \(‘himself’\) from the eye of the witness, or whether he ‘has forgotten the world’, which is the essential feature of all monologue art – it is based *on forgetting;* it is the music of forgetting.
