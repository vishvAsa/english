*On the origin of religions.* – The true invention of the religion-founders is first to establish a certain way of life and everyday customs that work as a *disciplina voluntatis*11 while at the same time removing boredom; and then to give just this life an *interpretation* that makes it appear illuminated by the highest worth, so that henceforth it becomes a good for which one fights and under certain circumstances even gives one’s life. Actually, the second invention is the more important: the first, the way of life, was usually already in place, though alongside other ways of life and without any consciousness of its special worth. The significance, the originality of the religion-founder usually lies in his *seeing* and *selecting* this way of life, in his *guessing* for the first time what it can be used for and how it can be interpreted. Jesus \(or Paul\), for example, discovered the life of the small people in the Roman province, a humble, virtuous, depressed life: he explained it, he put the highest meaning and value into it – and thereby also the courage to despise every other way of life, the silent Moravian brotherhood12 fanaticism, the clandestine subterranean self-confidence that grows and grows and is finally ready to ‘overcome the world’ \(i.e. Rome and the upper classes throughout the empire\). Buddha likewise discovered, scattered indeed among all classes and social strata of his people, that type of person who is good and gracious \(above all, inoffensive\) out of laziness and who, also from laziness, lives abstinently and with nearly no needs at all: he understood how such a type of person would inevitably, with all of his *vis inertiae*,13 have to roll into a faith that promises to *prevent* the return of earthly toil \(i.e. of work and action in general\), – this ‘understanding’ was his genius. The religion-founder must be psychologically infallible in his knowledge of a certain average breed of souls who have not yet *recognized* one another as allies. He is the one who brings them together; and to that extent, the establishment of a religion always turns into a long festival of recognition. –
