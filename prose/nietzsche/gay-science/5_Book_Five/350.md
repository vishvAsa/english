*In honour of the homines religiosi.*10 – The struggle against the church is certainly, among other things – for it means many things – also the struggle of the baser, meaner, more cheerful, more confiding, more superficial natures against the dominion of the graver, deeper, and more contemplative, that is, more evil and distrustful individuals who, with a long-standing suspicion about the value of existence, also brooded over their own worth: the base instinct of the people, its sensuality, its ‘good heart’, rebelled against them. The entire Roman Church rests on a Southern distrust of human nature which is always misunderstood in the North. The European South has inherited this suspicion from the deep Orient, from ancient mysterious Asia and its contemplation. Protestantism is, to be sure, an uprising in favour of the upright, the guileless, the shallow \(the North has always been more good-natured and superficial than the South\); but it was the French Revolution that finally and ceremoniously handed over the sceptre to the ‘good people’ \(to the sheep, the donkey, the goose, and everything that is incurably shallow and loudmouthed and ripe for the madhouse of ‘modern ideas’\).
