But why should there not be equally good reasons for the disguise of ‘moral men’, for their veil of moral formulas and notions of decency, for the whole benevolent concealment of our actions behind the concepts of duty, virtue, public spirit, respectability, self-denial?

The European disguises himself *with morality* because he has become a sick, sickly, maimed animal which has good reasons for being ‘tame’; because he is almost a monstrosity, something half, weak, awkward...It is not the ferocity of the beast of prey that needs a moral disguise, but the herd animal with its deep mediocrity, fear, and boredom with itself. *Morality dresses up the European* – let’s admit it\! – into something nobler, grander, goodlier, something ‘divine’ –
