*The argument from growing solitary.* – The reproach of conscience is weak in even the most conscientious people compared to the feeling: ‘This or that is against the morals \(*die gute Sitte*\) of *your* society.’ Even the strongest person still *fears* a cold look or a sneer on the face of those among whom and for whom he has been brought up. What is he really afraid of? Growing solitary\! This is the argument that refutes even the best arguments for a person or a cause. – Thus the herd instinct speaks out in us.
