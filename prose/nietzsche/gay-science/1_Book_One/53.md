*Where the good begins.* – At the point where the poor power of the eye is no longer able to see the evil drive as such, owing to its increasing subtlety, man posits the realm of goodness; and the feeling of now having stepped into the land of goodness excites all those impulses that had been threatened and limited by the evil drive, such as the feeling of security, of comfort, of benevolence. So: the duller the eye, the more extensive the good\! Hence the eternal cheerfulness of the common people and of children\! Hence the gloominess and grief – akin to a bad conscience – of the great thinkers\!
