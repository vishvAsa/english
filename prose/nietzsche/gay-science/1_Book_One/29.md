*The add-on-liars.* – When people in France started to fight the Aristotelian unities18 and others consequently also started to defend them, one could see again something that is so often apparent but that people are loath to see: *one lied to oneself,* inventing reasons for these laws, simply to avoid admitting that one had become *used* to them and would no longer have it any other way. And that is what one does, and has always done, within every prevailing morality and religion: the reasons and intents behind habits are invented only when some people start attacking the habits and *asking* for reasons and intents. Here we have the great dishonesty of conservatives of all times – they are the add-on-liars.
