*What others know about us.* – What we know about ourselves and remember is not as decisive to our life’s happiness as it is believed to be. One day, what *others* know \(or think they know\) about us assails us – and then we realize that that is more powerful. It is easier to deal with a bad conscience than a bad reputation.
