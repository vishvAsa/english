*Last words.* – One will recall that the emperor Augustus, that frightful man who had as much self-control and who could be as silent as any wise Socrates, became indiscreet against himself with his last words: he let his mask fall for the first time when he made it clear that he had worn a mask and acted a comedy – he had played the father of the fatherland and the wisdom on the throne well enough to create the proper illusion\! *Plaudite amici, comoedia finita est\!*21 The thought of the dying Nero – *qualis artifex pereo\!*22 – was also the thought of the dying Augustus: actor’s vanity\! Actor’s prolixity\! And truly the opposite of the dying Socrates\!23 But Tiberius died silently, this most tormented of all self-tormentors – *he* was genuine and no actor\! What might have passed through his mind at the end? Maybe this: ‘Life – that is a long death. What a fool I was to shorten so many lives\! Was *I* made to be a benefactor? I should have given them eternal *life:* that way, I could have *seen them die* forever. *That’s* why I had such good eyes: *qualis spectator pereo\!’*24 When after a long death-struggle he seemed to recover his strength, it was considered advisable to smother him with pillows – he died a double death.25
