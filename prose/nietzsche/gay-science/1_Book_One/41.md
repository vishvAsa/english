*Against remorse.* – The thinker sees his own actions as experiments and questions, as seeking explanations of something: to him, success and failure are primarily *answers.* To be vexed or even to feel remorse because something goes wrong – he leaves that to those who act because they were ordered to do so and who expect a beating when his gracious lordship is not pleased with the result.
