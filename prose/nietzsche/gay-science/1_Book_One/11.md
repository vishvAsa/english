*Consciousness \(Bewußtsein*\)6 – Consciousness \(*Bewußtheit*\) is the latest development of the organic, and hence also its most unfinished and unrobust feature. Consciousness gives rise to countless mistakes that lead an animal or human being to perish sooner than necessary, ‘beyond destiny’, as Homer puts it.7 If the preserving alliance of the instincts were not so much more powerful, if it did not serve on the whole as a regulator, humanity would have to perish with open eyes of its misjudging and its fantasizing, of its lack of thoroughness and its incredulity – in short, of its consciousness; or rather, without the instincts, humanity would long have ceased to exist\! Before a function is fully developed and mature, it constitutes a danger to the organism; it is a good thing for it to be properly tyrannized in the meantime\! Thus, consciousness is properly tyrannized – and not least by one’s pride in it\! One thinks it constitutes the *kernel* of man, what is abiding, eternal, ultimate, most original in him\! One takes consciousness to be a given determinate magnitude\! One denies its growth and intermittences\! Sees it as ‘the unity of the organism’\! This ridiculous overestimation and misapprehension of consciousness has the very useful consequence that an all-too-rapid development of consciousness was *prevented.* Since they thought they already possessed it, human beings did not take much trouble to acquire it – and things are no different today\! The *task* of *assimilating knowledge* and making it instinctive is still quite new; it is only beginning to dawn on the human eye and is yet barely discernible – it is a task seen only by those who have understood that so far we have incorporated only our *errors* and that all of our consciousness refers to errors\!
