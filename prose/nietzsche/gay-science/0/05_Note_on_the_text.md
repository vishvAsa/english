The text used for this translation is printed in the now standard edition of Nietzsche’s works edited by Giorgio Colli and Mazzino Montinari \(Berlin, de Gruyter, 1967–77\). Their edition, and that of Peter Pütz \(Munich, Goldmann, 1994\), have been used in the preparation of the footnotes to this edition.
