1849His father, a Lutheran minister, dies at age thirty-six of ‘softening of the brain’.

1850Brother dies; family moves to Naumburg to live with father’s mother and her sisters.

1858Begins studies at Pforta, Germany’s most famous school for education in the classics.

1864Graduates from Pforta with a thesis in Latin on the Greek poet Theognis; enters the University of Bonn as a theology student.

1865Transfers from Bonn, following the classical philologist Friedrich Ritschl to Leipzig where he registers as a philology student; reads Schopenhauer’s *The World as Will and Representation.*

1866Reads Friedrich Lange’s *History of Materialism.*

1868Meets Richard Wagner.

1869On Ritschl’s recommendation is appointed professor of classical philology at Basle at the age of twenty-four before completing his doctorate \(which is then conferred without a dissertation\); begins frequent visits to the Wagner residence at Tribschen.

1870Serves as a medical orderly in the Franco-Prussian war; contracts a serious illness and so serves only two months. Writes ‘The Dionysiac World View’.

1872Publishes his first book, *The Birth of Tragedy;* its dedicatory preface to Richard Wagner claims for art the role of ‘the highest task and truly metaphysical activity of his life’; devastating reviews follow.

1873Publishes ‘David Strauss, the Confessor and the Writer’, the first of his *Untimely Meditations;* begins taking books on natural science out of the Basle library, whereas he had previously confined himself largely to books on philological matters. Writes ‘On Truth and Lying in a Non-Moral Sense’.

1874Publishes two more *Meditations,* ‘The Uses and Disadvantages of History for Life’ and ‘Schopenhauer as Educator’.

1876Publishes the fourth *Meditation,* ‘Richard Wagner in Bayreuth’, which already bears subtle signs of his movement away from Wagner.

1878Publishes *Human, All Too Human* \(dedicated to the memory of Voltaire\); it praises science over art as the high culture and thus marks a decisive turn away from Wagner.

1879Terrible health problems force him to resign his chair at Basle \(with a small pension\); publishes ‘Assorted Opinions and Maxims’, the first part of vol. II of *Human, All Too Human;* begins living alone in Swiss and Italian boarding-houses.

1880Publishes ‘The Wanderer and His Shadow’, which becomes the second part of vol. 11 of *Human, All Too Human.*

1881Publishes *Daybreak.*

1882Publishes *Idylls of Messina* \(eight poems\) in a monthly magazine; publishes *The Gay Science* \(first edition\); friendship with Paul Ree and Lou Andreas-Salomé ends badly, leaving Nietzsche devastated.

1883Publishes the first two parts of *Thus Spoke Zarathustra;* learns of Wagner’s death just after mailing part one to the publisher.

1884Publishes the third part of *Thus Spoke Zarathustra.*

1885Publishes the fourth part of *Zarathustra* for private circulation only.

1886Publishes *Beyond Good and Evil*; writes prefaces for new releases of: *The Birth of Tragedy, Human, All Too Human* vols. I, 11, and *Daybreak*.

1887Publishes expanded edition of *The Gay Science* with a new preface, a fifth book, and an appendix of poems; publishes *Hymn to Life,* a musical work for chorus and orchestra; publishes *On* the Genealogy of Morality.

1888Publishes *The Case of Wagner,* composes a collection of poems, *Dionysian Dithyrambs,* and four short books: *Twilight of Idols, The Antichrist, Ecce Homo,* and *Nietzsche contra Wagner.*

1889Collapses physically and mentally in Turin on 3 January; writes a few lucid notes but never recovers sanity; is briefly institutionalized; spends remainder of his life as an invalid, living with his mother and then his sister, who also gains control of his literary estate.

1900Dies in Weimar on 25 August.
