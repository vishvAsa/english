Prelude in German Rhymes\*

* * *









*1. Invitation*

Dare to taste my fare, dear diner\!  
Come tomorrow it tastes finer  
and day after even good\!  
If you still want more – I’ll make it,  
from past inspiration take it,  
turning food for thought to food.



*2. My Happiness*

Since I grew weary of the search  
I taught myself to find instead.  
Since cross winds caused my ship to lurch  
I sail with all winds straight ahead.



*3. Undaunted*

Where you stand, there dig deep\!  
Below you lies the well\!  
Let obscurantists wail and weep:  
‘Below is always – hell\!’



*4. Dialogue*

A. Was I ill? Have I recovered?

Has my doctor been discovered?

How have I forgotten all?

B. Now I know you have recovered:

Healthy is who can’t recall.



*5. To the Virtuous*

Our virtues too should step lively to and fro:  
Like the verses of Homer, they have to come *and go\!*



*6. Worldly Wisdom*

Stay not where the lowlands are\!  
Climb not into the sky\!  
The world looks best by far  
when viewed from halfway high.



*7. Vademecum – Vadetecum*1

My way and language speak to you,  
you follow me, pursue me too?  
To thine own self and way be true:  
Thus follow me, but gently do\!



*8. On the Third Shedding*

Already cracks and breaks my skin,  
my appetite unslaking  
is fuelled by earth I’ve taken in:  
This snake for earth is aching.  
Among the stones and grass I wear  
a path from fen to firth,  
to eat what’s always been my fare  
you, my snake food, you my earth.



*9. My Roses*

Yes\! My joy – it wants to gladden –,  
every joy wants so to gladden\!  
Would you pluck my rose and sadden?

You must crouch on narrow ledges,  
prop yourself on ropes and wedges,  
prick yourself on thorny hedges\!

For my joy – it loves to madden\!  
For my joy – is malice laden\!  
Would you pluck my rose and sadden?



*10. The Scornful One*

Much do I let fall and spill,  
thus I’m scornful, you malign.  
One who drinks from cups too full will  
often let much fall and spill –,  
yet never think to blame the wine.



*11. The Proverb Speaks*

Sharp and mild, dull and keen,  
well known and strange, dirty and clean,  
where both the fool and wise are seen:  
All this am I, have ever been, –  
in me dove, snake and swine convene\!



*12. To a Friend of Light*

If you want to spare your eyes and your mind,  
follow the sun from the shadows behind.



*13. For Dancers*

Slipp’ry ice  
is paradise  
as long as dancing will suffice.



*14. The Good Man*

Better an enmity cut from one block  
than friendship held together by glue.



*15. Rust*

Rust must be added: sharpness goes unsung\!  
Else they will always say: ‘He is too young\!’



*16. Upward*

‘How do I best get to the top of this hill?’  
‘Climb it, don’t think it, and maybe you will.’



*17. Motto of A Brute*

Never beg\! It’s whining I dread\!  
Take, I beg you, just take instead\!



*18. Narrow Souls*

It’s narrow souls that I despise;  
not good, not evil, not my size.



*19. The Involuntary Seducer*

He shot an empty word into the blue  
to pass the time – and downed a woman too.



*20. Consider This*

A twofold pain is easier to bear  
than one pain: care to take a dare?



*21. Against Arrogance*

Don’t let your ego swell too much,  
a bubble bursts with just a touch.



*22. Man and Female*

‘Rob yourself the female, who to your heart appeals\!’ –  
So thinks a man; but she won’t rob, a woman only steals.



*23. Interpretation*

If I read me, then I read into me:  
I can’t construe myself objectively.  
But he who climbs consuming his own might  
bears me with him unto the brighter light.



*24. Medication for Pessimists*2

You whine that nothing pleases you?  
Still pouting, friend, and must you mutter?  
I hear you curse, and shout and sputter –  
it breaks my heart and patience too\!  
Come with me, friend\! A nice fat toad,  
if swallowed voluntarily  
with eyes closed and summarily –  
might lessen your dyspeptic load.



*25. Request*

I know another person’s thought  
and who I am, I know that not.  
My vision is too close to me –  
I am not what I saw and see.  
I’d use myself more perfectly  
if I could move away from me.  
Yet not so distant as my foe\!  
My closest friend’s too far off, no –  
give me instead the middle ground\!  
Do you surmise what I propound?



*26. My Hardness*

I must leave by a hundred stairs,  
I must ascend though I hear your cares:  
‘You are hard: Are we made of stone?’  
I must leave by a hundred stairs,  
And being a stair appeals to none.



*27. The Wanderer*

‘The path ends\! Abyss and deathly silence loom\!’  
You wanted this\! Your will strayed to its doom\!  
Now wanderer, stand\! Be keen and cool as frost\!  
Believe in danger now and you – are lost.



*28. Consolation for Beginners*

See the child, with pigs she’s lying,  
helpless, face as white as chalk\!  
Crying only, only crying –  
will she ever learn to walk?  
Don’t give up\! Stop your sighing,  
soon she’s dancing ‘round the clock\!  
Once her own two legs are trying,  
she’ll stand on her head and mock.



*29. Stellar Egotism*

If I, round barrel that I am,  
did not roll ‘round me like a cam,  
how could I bear, and not catch fire,  
to the chase the sun as I desire?



*30. The Closest One*

The closest one from me I bar:  
Away and up with him, and far\!  
How else could he become my star?



*31. The Disguised Saint*

Joy too great you are concealing,  
you engage in dev’lish dealing,  
devil’s wit and devil’s dress.  
But no use\! Your eye’s revealing  
piety and holiness\!



*32. The Bound Man*

A. He stands and hears: what’s wrong, he’s thinking?  
What sound provokes his heart to sinking?  
What was it hurled him to the ground?  
B. Like all who once in chains were bound,  
He hears around him – iron clinking.



*33. The Solitary One*

Despised by me are following and leading.  
Commanding? Even worse to me than heeding\!  
Who does not scare *himself* can frighten no one:  
The one who causes fear can lead another.  
But just to lead myself is too much bother\!  
I love, as do the sea and forest creatures,  
to lose myself a while in nature’s features,  
to hide away and brood in secret places  
until, lured home at last from distant traces,  
my self-seduction lets me see – my features.



*34. Seneca et hoc genus omne*3

They write and write their desiccat-  
ing learned la-di-da-di,  
as if *primum scribere,*  
*deinde philosophari*.



*35. Ice*

Yes\! At times I do make ice:  
Useful is ice for digesting\!  
If you had much for digesting,  
oh how you would love my ice\!



*36. Juvenilia*4

My old wisdom’s A and O  
sounded here: what did I hear?  
Now it does not strike me so,  
just the tired Ah\! and Oh\!  
that youth inspired fills my ear.



*37. Caution*

Into that region trav’lers must not go:  
And if you’re smart, be cautious even so\!  
They lure and love you till you’re torn apart:  
They’re halfwit zealots – : witless from the heart\!



*38. The Pious One Speaks*

God loves us *because* he created us\!  
‘Man created God\!’ – respond the jaded.  
And yet should not love what he created?  
Should even deny it *because* he made it?  
Such cloven logic is limping and baited.



*39. In Summer*5

Beneath the sweat of our own brow  
we have to eat our bread?  
If you sweat, eat nothing now,  
the wise physician said.  
The Dog Star winks: what does it know?  
What says its fiery winking?  
Beneath the sweat of our own brow  
our wine we should be drinking\!



*40. Without Envy*

His gaze is envyless: and him you praise?  
No thirst for your esteem perturbs his gaze;  
he has the eagle’s vision for the long view,  
it’s stars he sees, just stars – he looks beyond you\!



*41. Heracliteanism*

Happiness on earth, friends,  
only stems from war\!  
Powder smoke, in fact, mends  
friendship even more\!  
One in three all friends are:  
Brothers in distress,  
equals facing rivals,  
free men – facing death\!



*41. Principle of the All-Too-Refined*

Rather on your tiptoes stand  
than crawling on all fours\!  
Rather through the keyhole scanned  
than gazed through open doors\!



*43. Admonition*

It’s fame on which your mind is set?  
Then heed what I say:  
Before too long prepare to let  
honor slip away.



*44. The Well-Grounded One*6

A scholar I? I’ve no such skill\! –  
I’m merely *grave* – just heavy set\!  
I fall and fall and fall until  
I to the bottom get.



*45. Forever*

‘Today I come, I choose today’ –  
think all who come and mean to stay.  
Though all the world may speculate:  
‘You come too early\! Come too late\!’



*46. Judgements of the Weary*

The sun is cursed by all men jaded;  
to them the worth of trees is – shaded\!



*47. Going Down7*

‘He sinks, he falls now’ – thus resumes your mocking;  
in truth, look closely: Down to you he’s walking\!  
His super-joy became too much to bear,  
his super-light dispels your gloomy air.



*48. Against the Laws*

From now on time hangs by a hair  
around my neck, suspended there:  
from now on stars shine randomly, sun, rooster crow, and shadow flee,  
whatever brought time to my mind  
that now is mute and deaf and blind: –  
All nature’s still in me, it balks  
at ticking laws and ticking clocks.



*49. The Wise Man Speaks*

Unknown to folks, yet useful to the crowd,  
I drift along my way, now sun, now cloud  
and always I’m above this crowd\!



*50. Lost His Head*

Now she has wit – what led her to this find?  
Because of her a man had lost his mind.  
His head was rich before this misadventure:  
His head went straight to hell – no\! no\! to her\!



*51. Pious Wishes*8

‘Keys should all just disappear,  
lost from stem to stern,  
and in keyholes far and near  
skeletons should turn\!’  
Thus thinks when the day is done  
each who is – a skeleton.



*52. Writing With One’s Foot*

I do not write with hand alone:  
My foot does writing of its own.  
Firm, free, and bold my feet engage  
in running over field and page.



*53. ‘Human, All Too Human. ‘A Book*9

When looking back you’re sad and not robust,  
you trust the future when yourself you trust:  
Oh bird, do you belong to eagle’s brood?  
Are you Minerva’s favourite hoot hoot?



*54. To My Reader*

Strong teeth and good digestion too –  
this I wish thee\!  
And once my book’s agreed with you,  
then surely you’ll agree with me\!



*55. The Realistic Painter*

‘To all of nature true\!’ – How does he plan?  
Would nature fit an image *made by man?*  
The smallest piece of world is infinite\! –  
He ends up painting that which he *sees fit.*  
And what does he see fit? Paint what he *can\!*



*56. Poet’s Vanity*

I’ll find wood, just give me substance  
strong enough to bind like glue\!  
Cramming sense in rhyme is nonsense  
worthy of a boast – or two\!



*57. Choosy Taste*

Were it my choice to exercise,  
I know that I would opt for  
a cosy place in Paradise:  
Better still – outside the door\!



*58. The Crooked Nose*10

Your nose projects, so grand and plump,  
into the land, its nostrils pump –  
thus hornless rhino, lacking grace  
you fall, proud mortal, on your face\!  
And that’s the way it always goes:  
Straight pride alongside crooked nose.



*59. The Pen Scribbles*

My pen, it scribbles: this is hell\!  
Have I been damned to have to scribble? –  
I dip it boldly in the well  
and write broad streams of inky drivel.  
See how it flows, so full, so pure\!  
See how each thing I try succeeds\!  
The text’s not lucid, to be sure –  
So what? What I write no one reads.



*60. Higher Men*

He climbs on high – him we should praise\!  
But that one comes from high up always\!  
Immune to praise he lives his days,  
he *is* the sun’s rays\!



*61. The Sceptic Speaks*

Your life is halfway spent,  
the clock hand moves, your soul now quakes with fear\!  
Long roaming forth it went  
and searched but nothing found – and wavers here?

Your life is halfway spent:  
In pain and error how the hours did crawl\!  
Why can you not relent? –  
Just this I seek – some reason for it all\!



*62. Ecce Homo*

Yes\! I know now whence I came\!  
Unsatiated like a flame  
my glowing ember squanders me.  
Light to all on which I seize,  
ashen everything I leave:  
Flame am I most certainly\!



*63. Stellar Morals*

Ordained to move as planets do,  
what matters, star, the dark to you?

Roll blithely through our human time\!  
Beyond its wretched mis’ry climb\!

The furthest world deserves your shine:  
For you compassion is a crime\!

One law applies to you: be thine\!







\* ‘Scherz, List, und Rache’ is the title of a libretto written by Goethe and set to music by Peter Gast, Nietzsche’s friend and disciple/secretary. The title itself, like the subtitle ‘Prelude in German Rhymes’, foreshadows the musical playfulness to be found both in the poems and in *The Gay Science;* it also voices the hope that readers will recognize in the German language a medium of grace and style, as seen for example in the writings of Goethe and Nietzsche. *Scherz, List und Rache* was not set to music in the 1780s, though Goethe had intended it for a composer, and he published it in 1790 with his other works. He had endeavoured in the 1780s, after his Italian journey, to reform the German comic opera in the direction of the Italian *opera buffa.*

1 *Vademecum* is Latin for ‘go with me’, and refers to a book one carries all the time. *Vadetecum* is Nietzsche’s improvement on the idea: ‘go with yourself’.

2 Nietzsche’s inspiration for the toad as medicine derives from a maxim by Chamfort, to the effect that a toad ingested each morning will make the rest of the day taste better.

3 Seneca \(Roman philosopher\) and his lot. The Latin: ‘First write, then philosophize.’

4 Alpha and Omega are the first and last letters of the Greek alphabet, hence proverbially the ‘alpha and omega’ are said to comprise everything.

5 Genesis 3:19: ‘In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread.’

6 *Gründlich* in German means thorough, based on *Grund* \(ground\).

7 *Niedergang* means decline, but it is ambiguous because it is formed from *nieder* \(down\) and the past participle of *gehen* \(to go\). Compare Zarathustra’s ‘going under’ in the prologue of *Thus Spoke Zarathustra.*

8 *Dietrich* in German is a skeleton key, or combination key capable of opening any lock. It is also a common given name for males.

9 Minerva, Roman goddess of wisdom, the arts and crafts, and medicine, was identified with the Greek goddess Athene, whose attribute was the sacred and wise owl. *Uhu* is the German word for eagle-owl, as well as the sound \(hooting\) made by owls.

10 *Nashorn* means rhinoceros, from *Nase* \(nose\) and *Horn.*
