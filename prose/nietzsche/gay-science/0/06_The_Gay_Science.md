\(‘La gaya scienza’\)

* * *







This house is my own and here I dwell,  
I’ve never aped nothing from no one  
and – laugh at each master, mark me well,  
who at himself has not poked fun.

Over my front door.









The title is a translation into German \(in our edition, into English\) of the Provencal subtitle. *Gaya scienza* \(‘joyful, cheerful, or gay science’\) was a term used by the troubadours in the twelfth to fourteenth centuries to refer to the art of poetry. In *Ecce Homo* Nietzsche writes that he has used the term *gaya scienza* here to designate the specific unity of ‘singer, knight, and free spirit’ which was characteristic of early Provencal culture.
