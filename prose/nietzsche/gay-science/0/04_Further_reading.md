The standard biography of Nietzsche in English is R. J. Hollingdale, *Nietzsche: The Man and his Philosophy,* recently published in a revised and updated second edition \(Cambridge University Press, 1999\). Lesley Chamberlain’s *Nietzsche in Turin: An Intimate Biography* \(Picador, 1997\) gives a vivid picture of his life in the period during which he was at work on *The Gay Science.* There are two excellent general introductions to Nietzsche’s philosophy, a short book by Michael Tanner, *Nietzsche* \(Oxford University Press, 1995\) and a slightly longer and more technical book by Henry Staten, *Nietzsche’s Voice* \(Cornell University Press, 1990\). Readers interested in Nietzsche’s epistemology and metaphysics should consult Maudemarie Clark’s *Nietzsche on Truth and Philosophy* \(Cambridge University Press, 1991\), John T. Wilcox, *Truth and Value in Nietzsche: A Study of his Metaethics and Epistemology* \(University of Michigan Press, 1974\), and Ken Gemes, ‘Nietzsche’s Critique of Truth’, *Philosophy and Phenomenological Research,* 52 \(1992\), 47–66. Those with an interest in Nietzsche’s moral philosophy should consult Alexander Nehamas, *Nietzsche: Life as Literature* \(Harvard University Press, 1987\). There are two recent helpful discussions of Nietzsche’s political and social thought: Bruce Detwiler, *Nietzsche and the Politics of Aristocratic Radicalism* \(University of Chicago Press, 1990\) and Mark Warren, *Nietzsche and Political Thought* \(MIT Press, 1988\). See also Peter Bergmann, *Nietzsche, ‘the Last Unpolitical German’* \(Indiana University Press, 1987\). For an interesting discussion of some aspects of Nietzsche’s legacy, see Steven E. Ascheim, *The Nietzsche Legacy in Germany 1890–1990* \(University of California Press, 1992\).
