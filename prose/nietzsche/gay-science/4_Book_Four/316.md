*Prophetic human beings.* – You are not sensible to the fact that prophetic human beings are full of suffering; you simply think they have been granted a beautiful ‘gift’ that you yourselves probably would like to have – but I will express myself in a parable. How animals can suffer from electricity in the air and clouds\! We see how certain species, for example, monkeys, have a prophetic insight about the weather \(as one can observe even in Europe – and not only in zoos, but also on Gibraltar\). But we don’t think of the fact that for them, their *pains* are prophets for them\! When under the influence of an approaching, as yet far from visible cloud a strong positive electrical charge suddenly turns into negative electricity and a change in the weather is impending, these animals act as if an enemy were approaching and prepare for defence or escape. Most often they crawl into hiding – they don’t see bad weather as weather, but as an enemy whose hand they can already *feel*\!
