*New caution.* – Let’s stop thinking so much about punishing, reproaching, and improving\! We rarely change an individual; and should we succeed, something else may have been accomplished, unnoticed: *we* may have been changed through him\! Let’s rather make sure our own influence *on all that is to come* balances and outweighs his influence\! Let’s not struggle in a direct fight, which is what reproaching, punishing, and desiring to improve amount to. Let’s rather raise ourselves that much higher. Let us give our own example ever more brilliant colours\! Let us darken the others through our light\! No – let’s not become *darker* on their account, like those who punish and are dissatisfied\! Let’s sooner step aside\! Let us look away\!
