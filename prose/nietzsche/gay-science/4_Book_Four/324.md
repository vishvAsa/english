*In media vita.19* – No, life has not disappointed me. Rather, I find it truer, more desirable and mysterious every year – ever since the day the great liberator overcame me: the thought that life could be an experiment for the knowledge-seeker – not a duty, not a disaster, not a deception\! And knowledge itself: let it be something else to others, like a bed to rest on or the way to one, or a diversion or a form of idleness; to me it is a world of dangers and victories in which heroic feelings also have their dance- and playgrounds. ‘*Life as a means to knowledge* – with this principle in one’s heart one can not only live bravely but also *live gaily and laugh gaily\!* And who would know how to laugh and live well who did not first have a good understanding of war and victory?
