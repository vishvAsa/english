      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;For the new year.&lt;/em&gt; – I’m still alive; I still think: I must still be alive because I still have to think. *Sum, ergo cogito: cogito, ergo sum.*1 Today everyone allows himself to express his dearest wish and thoughts: so I, too, want to say what I wish from myself today and what thought first crossed my heart – what thought shall be the reason, warrant, and sweetness of the rest of my life! I want to learn more and more how to see what is necessary in things as what is beautiful in them – thus I will be one of those who make things beautiful. *Amor fati:*2 let that be my love from now on! I do not want to wage war against ugliness. I do not want to accuse; I do not even want to accuse the accusers. Let &lt;em&gt;looking away&lt;/em&gt; be my only negation! And, all in all and on the whole: some day I want only to be a Yes-sayer!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Personal providence.&lt;/em&gt; – There is a certain high point in life; once we have reached it we are, for all our freedom, once more in the greatest danger of spiritual unfreedom; and no matter how much we have confronted the beautiful chaos of existence and denied it all providential reason and goodness, we still have to pass our hardest test. For it is only now that the thought of a personal providence confronts us with the most penetrating force and the best advocate, appearance, speaks for it – now that we so palpably see how everything that befalls us continually &lt;em&gt;turns out for the best.&lt;/em&gt; Every day and every hour life seems to want nothing else than to prove this proposition again and again; be it what it may – bad or good weather, the loss of a friend, a sickness, slander, the absence of a letter, the spraining of an ankle, a glance into a shop, a counterargument, the opening of a book, a dream, fraud – it shows itself immediately or very soon to be something that ‘was not allowed to be lacking’ – it is full of deep meaning and use precisely &lt;em&gt;for us!&lt;/em&gt; Is there any more dangerous seduction than to renounce one’s faith in the gods of Epicurus,3 those carefree and unknown ones, and to believe instead in some petty deity who is full of worries and personally knows every little hair on our heads and finds nothing nauseating in the most miserable small service? Well – I mean in spite of it all! – we should leave the gods alone as well as the genies at our service and be content with the assumption that our own practical and theoretical skill in interpreting and arranging events has now reached its apex. Nor should we think too highly of this dexterity of our wisdom when at times the wonderful harmony created by the playing of our instrument surprises us all too much – a harmony that sounds too good for us to dare to give credit to ourselves. Indeed, now and then someone plays &lt;em&gt;with&lt;/em&gt; us – good old chance; occasionally chance guides our hand, and the wisest providence could not invent music more beautiful than what our foolish hand then produces.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The thought of death.&lt;/em&gt; – It gives me a melancholy happiness to live in the midst of this jumble of lanes, needs, and voices: how much enjoyment, impatience, desire; how much thirsty life and drunkenness of life comes to light every moment of the day! And yet things will soon be so silent for all these noisy, living, life-thirsty ones! How even now everyone’s shadow stands behind him, as his dark fellow traveller! It’s always like the last moment before the departure of an emigrant ship: people have more to say to each other than ever; the hour is late; the ocean and its desolate silence await impatiently behind all the noise – so covetous, so certain of its prey. And everyone, everyone takes the past to be little or nothing while the near future is everything; hence this haste, this clamour, this outshouting and out-hustling one another. Everyone wants to be the first in this future – and yet death and deathly silence are the only things certain and common to all in this future! How strange that this sole certainty and commonality barely makes an impression on people and that they are &lt;em&gt;farthest&lt;/em&gt; removed from feeling like a brotherhood of death! It makes me happy to see that people do not at all want to think the thought of death! I would very much like to do something that would make the thought of life even a hundred times more &lt;em&gt;worth being thought&lt;/em&gt; to them.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Star friendship.&lt;/em&gt; – We were friends and have become estranged. But that was right, and we do not want to hide and obscure it from ourselves as if we had to be ashamed of it. We are two ships, each of which has its own goal and course; we may cross and have a feast together, as we did – and then the good ships lay so quietly in one harbour and in one sun that it may have seemed as if they had already completed their course and had the same goal. But then the almighty force of our projects drove us apart once again, into different seas and sunny zones, and maybe we will never meet again – or maybe we will, but will not recognize each other: the different seas and suns have changed us! That we had to become estranged is the law &lt;em&gt;above&lt;/em&gt; us; through it we should come to have more respect for each other – and the thought of our former friendship should become more sacred! There is probably a tremendous invisible curve and stellar orbit in which our different ways and goals may be &lt;em&gt;included&lt;/em&gt; as small stretches – let us rise to this thought! But our life is too short and our vision too meagre for us to be more than friends in the sense of that sublime possibility. – Let us then &lt;em&gt;believe&lt;/em&gt; in our star friendship even if we must be earth enemies.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Architecture for those who wish to pursue knowledge.&lt;/em&gt; – One day, and probably soon, we will need some recognition of what is missing primarily in our big cities: quiet and wide, expansive places for reflection – places with long, high-ceilinged arcades for bad or all-too-sunny weather, where no shouts or noise from carriages can penetrate and where refined manners would prohibit even priests from praying aloud: a whole complex of buildings and sites that would give expression to the sublimity of contemplation and of stepping aside. The time is past when the Church had a monopoly on contemplation, when the &lt;em&gt;vita contemplativa4&lt;/em&gt; always had to be first and foremost a &lt;em&gt;vita religiosa:5&lt;/em&gt; and everything built by the Church gives expression to that idea. I do not see how we could make do with those buildings, even if they were stripped of their churchly purposes; as houses of God and spaces for ostentatiously displaying our intercourse with the World-Beyond, these buildings speak much that is too emotional and too partisan for us godless ones to be able to think &lt;em&gt;our thoughts&lt;/em&gt; here. We want to have &lt;em&gt;us&lt;/em&gt; translated into stone and plants; we want to take walks &lt;em&gt;in us&lt;/em&gt; when we stroll through these hallways and gardens.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Knowing how to end.&lt;/em&gt; – Masters of the first rank are recognized by the fact that in matters great and small they know how to find an end perfectly, be it the end of a melody or a thought; of a tragedy’s fifth act or an act of state. The best of the second rank always get restless toward the end, and do not fall into the sea with such proud and calm balance as do, for example, the mountains at Portofino – where the bay of Genoa finishes its melody.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Gait.&lt;/em&gt; – There are certain tricks of the spirit by which even great minds betray that they come from the mob or half-mob; the gait and stride of their thoughts especially plays the traitor: they cannot &lt;em&gt;walk.&lt;/em&gt; Thus Napoleon too, was unable, to his great vexation, to walk in a princely and ‘legitimate’ fashion on occasions that really demanded it, such as great coronation processions; even there, he was always just the leader of a column – proud and hasty at the same time, and very conscious of it. It is laughable to behold those authors who make the ruffled robes of long sentences rustle about themselves: they are trying to hide their &lt;em&gt;feet.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Preparatory human beings.&lt;/em&gt; – I welcome all the signs of a more virile, warlike age approaching that will above all restore honour to bravery! For it shall pave the way for a still higher age and gather the strength that the latter will need one day – the age that will carry heroism into the search for knowledge and &lt;em&gt;wage wars&lt;/em&gt; for the sake of thoughts and their consequences. To this end we now need many preparatory brave human beings who surely cannot spring from nothingness any more than from the sand and slime of present-day civilization and urbanization: human beings who know how to be silent, lonely, determined, and satisfied and steadfast in invisible activities; human beings profoundly predisposed to look, in all things, for what must be &lt;em&gt;overcome;&lt;/em&gt; human beings whose cheerfulness, patience, modesty, and contempt for great vanities is just as distinctive as their magnanimity in victory and patience with the small vanities of the defeated; human beings with a sharp and free judgement concerning all victors and the share of chance in every victory and glory; human beings with their own festivals, their own working days, their own periods of mourning, accustomed to command with assurance and equally prepared, when called for, to obey – in each case, equally proud, equally serving their own cause; more endangered, more fruitful, happier human beings! For – believe me – the secret for harvesting from existence the greatest fruitfulness and the greatest enjoyment is – &lt;em&gt;to live dangerously!&lt;/em&gt; Build your cities on the slopes of Vesuvius! Send your ships into uncharted seas! Live at war with your peers and yourselves! Be robbers and conquerors as long as you cannot be rulers and possessors, you seekers of knowledge! Soon the time will be past in which you had to be content living hidden in forests like shy deer! Finally the search for knowledge will reach for its due; it will want to rule and possess, and you with it!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Faith in oneself.&lt;/em&gt; – Few people have faith in themselves – and of these few, some possess it as a useful blindness or partial eclipse of the mind (what would they behold if they could see the bottom of themselves!), while the rest have to acquire it. Everything good, fine, or great they do is first of all an argument against the sceptic inside them. They have to convince or persuade &lt;em&gt;him,&lt;/em&gt; and that almost requires genius. These are the great self-dissatisfied people.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Excelsior&lt;/em&gt;.6 – ‘You will never pray again, never adore again, never again rest in endless trust; you refuse to let yourself stop to unharness your thoughts before any ultimate wisdom, goodness, or power; you have no perpetual guard and friend for your seven solitudes; you live without the view of a mountain-range with snow-capped peaks and fire in its heart; there is no avenger for you anymore, no final corrector of the text of your life; there is no more reason in what happens, no love in what will happen to you; no more resting place stands open for your heart in which to find and no longer seek; you arm yourself against any ultimate peace; you will the eternal recurrence of war and peace; – Man of renunciation, all of this you wish to renounce? Who will give you the strength to do so? No one yet has had the strength!’ There is a lake that one day refused to let itself flow off and formed a dam where it used to flow off: ever since, this lake rises higher and higher. Perhaps this very renunciation will lend us the strength to bear renunciation; perhaps man will rise ever higher when he no longer &lt;em&gt;flows off&lt;/em&gt; into a god.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Interruption.&lt;/em&gt; – These are hopes; but what will you see and hear of them when you have not experienced splendour, ardour, and rosy dawn in your own souls? I can only remind – more I cannot do! To move stones, to turn animals into humans – is that what you want from me? Oh, if you are still stones and animals, you had better look for your Orpheus7 first!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Delight in blindness.&lt;/em&gt; – ‘My thoughts’, said the wanderer to his shadow, ‘should show me where I stand, but they should not betray to me &lt;em&gt;where I am going.&lt;/em&gt; I love ignorance of the future and do not want to perish of impatience and premature tasting of things promised.’&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;High spirits.&lt;/em&gt; – It seems to me that most people simply do not believe in elevated moods, unless it be for moments or fifteen-minute intervals at most – except for those few who experience an elevated feeling over a longer period. But to be the human being of one elevated feeling, the embodiment of a single great mood, has hitherto been a mere dream and enchanting possibility; as yet, history does not offer us any certain examples of it. Nevertheless history might one day beget such people, too, given the creation and determination of a great many preconditions that even the dice rolls of the luckiest chance could not put together today. Perhaps the usual state for these souls would be what has so far entered our souls only as an occasional exception that made us shudder: a perpetual movement between high and low and the feeling of high and low; a continual sense of ascending stairs and at the same time of resting on clouds.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Get on the ships!&lt;/em&gt; – If one considers how an overall philosophical justification of one’s way of living and thinking affects each individual – namely, like a sun, warming, blessing, impregnating, shining especially for him; how it makes him independent of praise and blame, self-sufficient, rich, generous with happiness and good will; how it incessantly turns evil into good, brings all forces to bloom and ripen and keeps the petty, great weed of melancholy and moroseness from coming up at all – one exclaims longingly, in the end: Oh, how I wish that many such new suns would yet be created! Even the evil man, the unhappy man, and the exceptional man should have their philosophy, their good right, their sunshine! Pity for them is not what is needed! We have to unlearn this arrogant notion, however long humanity has spent learning and practising it – we do not need to present them with confessors, conjurers of souls, and forgivers of sins; rather, a new &lt;em&gt;justice&lt;/em&gt; is needed! And a new motto! And new philosophers! The moral earth, too, is round! The moral earth, too, has its antipodes! The antipodes, too, have their right to exist! There is another world to discover – and more than one! On to the ships, you philosophers!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;One thing is needful.&lt;/em&gt; – To ‘give style’ to one’s character – a great and rare art! It is practised by those who survey all the strengths and weaknesses that their nature has to offer and then fit them into an artistic plan until each appears as art and reason and even weaknesses delight the eye. Here a great mass of second nature has been added; there a piece of first nature removed – both times through long practice and daily work at it. Here the ugly that could not be removed is concealed; there it is reinterpreted into sublimity. Much that is vague and resisted shaping has been saved and employed for distant views – it is supposed to beckon towards the remote and immense. In the end, when the work is complete, it becomes clear how it was the force of a single taste that ruled and shaped everything great and small – whether the taste was good or bad means less than one may think; it’s enough that it was one taste! It will be the strong and domineering natures who experience their most exquisite pleasure under such coercion, in being bound by but also perfected under their own law; the passion of their tremendous will becomes less intense in the face of all stylized nature, all conquered and serving nature; even when they have palaces to build and gardens to design, they resist giving nature free rein. Conversely, it is the weak characters with no power over themselves who &lt;em&gt;hate&lt;/em&gt; the constraint of style: they feel that if this bitterly evil compulsion were to be imposed on them, they would have to become &lt;em&gt;commonplace&lt;/em&gt; under it – they become slaves as soon as they serve; they hate to serve. Such minds – and they may be of the first rank – are always out to shape or interpret their environment as &lt;em&gt;free&lt;/em&gt; nature – wild, arbitrary, fantastic, disorderly, and surprising – and they are well advised to do so, because only thus do they please themselves! For one thing is needful: that a human being should &lt;em&gt;attain&lt;/em&gt; satisfaction with himself – be it through this or that poetry or art; only then is a human being at all tolerable to behold! Whoever is dissatisfied with himself is continually prepared to avenge himself for this, and we others will be his victims if only by having to endure his sight. For the sight of something ugly makes one bad and gloomy.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Genoa.&lt;/em&gt; – I have been looking at this city for a long time, at its villas and pleasure-gardens and the wide circumference of its inhabited heights and slopes, and in the end I must say: I see &lt;em&gt;faces&lt;/em&gt; that belong to past generations; this region is dotted with images of bold and autocratic human beings. They have &lt;em&gt;lived&lt;/em&gt; and wish to live on – that is what they are telling me with their houses, built and adorned to last for centuries and not for the fleeting hour: they were well disposed towards life, however badly disposed they often may have been towards themselves. I keep seeing the builder, how he rests his gaze on everything built near and afar as well as on city, sea, and mountain contours, and how with his gaze he is perpetrating acts of violence and conquest: he wants to fit all this into &lt;em&gt;his&lt;/em&gt; plan and finally make it his &lt;em&gt;possession&lt;/em&gt; by incorporating it into his plan. The whole region is overgrown with this magnificent, insatiable lust for possessions and spoils; and even as these people heeded no boundaries in distant lands and, in their thirst for what was new, placed a new world beside the old one, so, too, at home each flared up against the other and found a way to express his superiority and place his personal infinity between himself and his neighbour. Each conquered his homeland again for himself by overwhelming it with his architectural ideas and refashioning it, so to speak, into a house that was a feast for his eyes. In the North one is impressed by the law and by the general delight in lawfulness and obedience as one considers the way cities are built: this allows one to recognize the inner propensity to uniformity and conformism which must have dominated the souls of all the builders. But here you find, upon turning every corner, a separate human being who knows the sea, adventure, and the Orient; a human being averse to the law and to the neighbour as to a kind of boredom, who measures everything old and established with envious eyes: he would, with a marvellous cunning of imagination, like to establish all this anew at least in thought; to put his hand to it, his meaning into it – if only for the moment of a sunny afternoon when his insatiable and melancholy soul feels sated for once, and only what is his own and nothing alien may appear to his eye.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;To the preachers of morals.&lt;/em&gt; – I do not want to moralize, but to those who do, I give this advice: if you want eventually to deprive the best things and situations of all their worth, then keep talking about them the way you have been! Place them at the top of your morality and talk from morning till night about the bliss of happiness, the tranquillity of the soul, about justice and immanent retribution – the way you carry on, all these good things will finally attain a popularity and street-clamour of their own, but at the same time all the gold that was on them will have worn off through handling, and all the gold &lt;em&gt;inside&lt;/em&gt; will have turned to lead. Verily, you know the art of alchemy in reverse, the devaluation of what is most valuable! Sometime you should try a different prescription to avoid reaching the opposite of what you seek, as you have so far: &lt;em&gt;deny&lt;/em&gt; these good things; withdraw from them the mob’s acclaim and their easy currency; make them once again the hidden modesty of solitary souls; say that &lt;em&gt;morality is something forbidden!&lt;/em&gt; That way you might win over for these things the kind of people who alone matter; I mean the &lt;em&gt;heroic.&lt;/em&gt; But then there must be something in them that provokes fear and not, as hitherto, disgust! Isn’t it time to say of morality what Master Eckhart said: ‘I ask God to rid me of God!’8&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Our air.&lt;/em&gt; – We know it very well: to those who glance at science as if passing it on a walk, in the manner of women and unfortunately also many artists, the severity of its service – this inexorability in matters great and small, this swiftness in weighing, judging, and passing judgement – has something dizzying and fear-inspiring. What frightens them especially is how the hardest is demanded and the best done despite the absence of praise and awards; rather, as among soldiers, what one mostly hears is almost exclusively reproaches and sharp reprimands – for doing things well is considered the rule, and failure the exception; yet here as everywhere else, the rule has a reticent mouth. Now this ‘severity of science’ has something in common with the form and decorum of the very best society: it frightens the uninitiated. But someone accustomed to it wants to live nowhere else than in this bright, transparent, strongly electric air – in this &lt;em&gt;masculine&lt;/em&gt; air. Anywhere else is not clean and airy enough for him: he suspects that &lt;em&gt;there,&lt;/em&gt; his best art would be of no real use to anyone and of no delight to himself; that among misunderstandings half his life would slip through his fingers; that much caution, much concealment and restraint would constantly be called for – ways of having large amounts of one’s strength sapped uselessly! But in &lt;em&gt;this&lt;/em&gt; severe and clear element he has his full strength: here he can fly! Why descend into those murky waters where one has to swim and wade and sully one’s wings? No, it’s too hard for us to live there; it’s not our fault that we were born for the air, for clean air, we rivals of the light beam, and that we would prefer to ride on specks of ether, like it – not away from the sun but &lt;em&gt;towards the sun!&lt;/em&gt; That, however, we cannot do. So let us do all we can do: bring light to the earth; be ‘the light of the earth’! And for that, we have our wings and our speed and our severity; for that, we are masculine and even terrifying, like fire. May those be terrified of us who do not know how to gain warmth and light from us!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Against the slanderers of nature.&lt;/em&gt; – I find those people unpleasant in whom every natural inclination immediately becomes a sickness, something disfiguring or even contemptible – &lt;em&gt;they&lt;/em&gt; have seduced us into the belief that man’s natural inclinations are evil; &lt;em&gt;they&lt;/em&gt; are the cause of our great injustice towards our nature, towards &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; nature! There are enough people who could well entrust themselves to their inclinations with grace and without care, but who do not for fear of the imagined ‘evil essence’ of nature! &lt;em&gt;That&lt;/em&gt; is why there is so little nobility among human beings; its distinguishing feature has always been to have no fear of oneself, to expect nothing contemptible from oneself, to fly without misgivings wherever we’re inclined – we free-born birds! And wherever we arrive, there will always be freedom and sunlight around us.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Brief habits.&lt;/em&gt; – I love brief habits and consider them invaluable means for getting to know &lt;em&gt;many&lt;/em&gt; things and states down to the bottom of their sweetnesses and bitternesses; my nature is designed entirely for brief habits, even in the needs of its physical health and generally &lt;em&gt;as far as&lt;/em&gt; I can see at all, from the lowest to the highest. I always believe &lt;em&gt;this&lt;/em&gt; will give me lasting satisfaction – even brief habits have this faith of passion, this faith in eternity – and that I am to be envied for having found and recognized it, and now it nourishes me at noon and in the evening and spreads a deep contentment around itself and into me, so that I desire nothing else, without having to compare, despise, or hate. And one day its time is up; the good thing parts from me, not as something that now disgusts me but peacefully and sated with me, as I with it, and as if we ought to be grateful to each other and so shake hands to say farewell. And already the new waits at the door along with my faith – the indestructible fool and sage! – that this new thing will be the right thing, the last right thing. This happens to me with dishes, thoughts, people, cities, poems, music, doctrines, daily schedules, and ways of living. &lt;em&gt;Enduring&lt;/em&gt; habits, however, I hate, and feel as if a tyrant has come near me and the air around me is &lt;em&gt;thickening&lt;/em&gt; when events take a shape that seems inevitably to produce enduring habits – for instance, owing to an official position, constant relations with the same people, a permanent residence, or uniquely good health. Yes, at the very bottom of my soul I am grateful to all my misery and illnesses and whatever is imperfect in me because they provide a hundred back doors through which I can escape enduring habits. To me the most intolerable, the truly terrible, would of course be a life entirely without habits, a life that continually demanded improvisation – that would be my exile and my Siberia.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A firm reputation.&lt;/em&gt; – A firm reputation used to be a thing of utmost utility; and wherever society is still ruled by herd mentality it is still today most expedient for everyone to &lt;em&gt;act&lt;/em&gt; as if his character and occupation are unchangeable, even if basically they are not. ‘One can depend on him; he stays the same’: wherever society is threatened this is the type of praise that means the most. Society sees in this person’s virtue, in that person’s ambition, in the thoughtfulness and passion of a third dependable ever-handy &lt;em&gt;instruments.&lt;/em&gt; This is a source of great gratification to society, and it bestows on this &lt;em&gt;instrument-nature,&lt;/em&gt; this staying-true-to-oneself, this immutability in views, aspirations, and even vices its highest honours. Such esteem, which blooms and has bloomed everywhere alongside the morality of custom (&lt;em&gt;Sittlichkeit der Sitte),&lt;/em&gt; fosters ‘character’ and brings all change, re-learning, and self-transformation into &lt;em&gt;ill repute.&lt;/em&gt; However great the advantages of this mentality may be elsewhere, to the &lt;em&gt;search for knowledge&lt;/em&gt; it is the most harmful kind of general judgement, for it condemns and discredits the willingness which a seeker after knowledge must have to declare himself &lt;em&gt;against&lt;/em&gt; his previous opinion and to mistrust anything that wishes to become &lt;em&gt;firm&lt;/em&gt; in us. The attitude of the seeker after knowledge, which is incompatible with a ‘firm reputation’, is considered &lt;em&gt;dishonourable&lt;/em&gt; while the petrifaction of opinions has all the honour to itself – still today we must live under the spell of such standards! How hard living is when one feels the judgement of many millennia against and around oneself! It is probable that the search for knowledge was afflicted for many millennia with a bad conscience and that there must have been much self-contempt and secret misery in the history of the greatest spirits.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Being able to contradict.&lt;/em&gt; – Everybody knows now that being able to stand contradiction is a high sign of culture. Some even know that the higher human being desires and invites contradiction in order to receive a hint about his own injustice of which he is as yet unaware. But the &lt;em&gt;ability to&lt;/em&gt; contradict, the acquired &lt;em&gt;good&lt;/em&gt; conscience accompanying hostility towards what is familiar, traditional, hallowed – that is better yet than both those abilities, and constitutes what is really great, new, and amazing in our culture; it is the step of all steps of the liberated spirit: who knows that?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sigh.&lt;/em&gt; – I caught this insight on the wing and quickly took the nearest shoddy words to fasten it lest it fly away from me. And now it has died of these barren words and hangs and flaps in them – and I hardly know any more, when I look at it, how I could have felt so happy when I caught this bird.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;What one should learn from artists.&lt;/em&gt; – What means do we have for making things beautiful, attractive, and desirable when they are not? And in themselves I think they never are! Here we have something to learn from physicians, when for example they dilute something bitter or add wine and sugar to the mixing bowl; but even more from artists, who are really constantly out to invent new artistic &lt;em&gt;tours de force&lt;/em&gt; of this kind. To distance oneself from things until there is much in them that one no longer sees and much that the eye must add &lt;em&gt;in order to see them at all,&lt;/em&gt; or to see things around a corner and as if they were cut out and extracted from their context, or to place them so that each partially distorts the view one has of the others and allows only perspectival glimpses, or to look at them through coloured glass or in the light of the sunset, or to give them a surface and skin that is not fully transparent: all this we should learn from artists while otherwise being wiser than they. For usually in their case this delicate power stops where art ends and life begins; &lt;em&gt;we,&lt;/em&gt; however, want to be poets of our lives, starting with the smallest and most commonplace details.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Preludes to science&lt;/em&gt; – So you believe the sciences would have emerged and matured, if they had not been preceded by magicians, alchemists, astrologers, and witches who with their promises and false claims created a thirst, hunger, and taste for &lt;em&gt;hidden and forbidden&lt;/em&gt; powers? Indeed, infinitely more has had to be &lt;em&gt;promised&lt;/em&gt; than can ever be fulfilled in order that anything at all be fulfilled in the realm of knowledge. Those things which now appear to us to be preludes and exercises preparatory to science were in the past certainly not practised and felt to be any such thing. Similarly perhaps to a distant age the whole of &lt;em&gt;religion&lt;/em&gt; will appear as an exercise and prelude. Perhaps religion could have been the strange means of making it possible one day for a few individuals to enjoy the whole self-sufficiency of a god and all his power of self-redemption. Indeed – one may ask – would man ever have learned to feel hunger for &lt;em&gt;himself&lt;/em&gt; and to find satisfaction and fullness in &lt;em&gt;himself&lt;/em&gt; without this religious training and prehistory? Did Prometheus9 first have to &lt;em&gt;imagine&lt;/em&gt; having &lt;em&gt;stolen&lt;/em&gt; light and pay for it before he could finally discover that he had created light &lt;em&gt;by desiring light,&lt;/em&gt; and that not only man but also &lt;em&gt;god&lt;/em&gt; was the work of &lt;em&gt;his own&lt;/em&gt; hands and clay in his hands? All mere images of the sculptor – no less than delusion, theft, the Caucasus, the vulture, and the whole tragic &lt;em&gt;Prometheia&lt;/em&gt; of all those who know?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Delusion of the contemplative ones.&lt;/em&gt; – Higher human beings distinguish themselves from the lower by seeing and hearing, and &lt;em&gt;thoughtfully&lt;/em&gt; seeing and hearing, immeasurably more – and just this distinguishes human beings from animals, and the higher animals from the lower. The world becomes ever fuller for someone who grows into the height of humanity; ever more baited hooks to attract his interest are cast his way; the things that stimulate him grow steadily in number, as do the kinds of things that please and displease him – the higher human being always becomes at the same time happier and unhappier. But a &lt;em&gt;delusion&lt;/em&gt; remains his constant companion: he thinks himself placed as &lt;em&gt;spectator&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;listener&lt;/em&gt; before the great visual and acoustic play that is life; he calls his nature &lt;em&gt;contemplative&lt;/em&gt; and thereby overlooks the fact that he is also the actual poet and ongoing author of life – that, to be sure, he differs greatly from the &lt;em&gt;actor&lt;/em&gt; of this drama, the so-called man of action, but even more so from a mere spectator and festival visitor &lt;em&gt;in front of&lt;/em&gt; the stage. As the poet, he certainly possesses &lt;em&gt;vis contemplativa&lt;/em&gt;10 and a retrospective view of his work; but at the same time and above all &lt;em&gt;vis creativa,11&lt;/em&gt; which the man of action lacks, whatever appearances and universal belief may say. It is we, the thinking-sensing ones, who really and continually &lt;em&gt;make&lt;/em&gt; something that is not yet there: the whole perpetually growing world of valuations, colours, weights, perspectives, scales, affirmations, and negations. This poem that we have invented is constantly internalized, drilled, translated into flesh and reality, indeed, into the commonplace, by the so-called practical human beings (our actors). Whatever has &lt;em&gt;value&lt;/em&gt; in the present world has it not in itself, according to its nature – nature is always value-less – but has rather been given, granted value, and &lt;em&gt;we&lt;/em&gt; were the givers and granters! Only we have created the world &lt;em&gt;that concerns human beings!&lt;/em&gt; But precisely this knowledge we lack, and when we catch it for a moment we have forgotten it the next: we misjudge our best power and underestimate ourselves just a bit, we contemplative ones. We are &lt;em&gt;neither as proud nor as happy&lt;/em&gt; as we could be.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The danger of the happiest.&lt;/em&gt; – To have refined senses and a refined taste; to be accustomed to the exquisite and most excellent things of the spirit as one is to the proper and most usual food; to enjoy a strong, bold, audacious soul; to go through life with a calm eye and a firm step, always prepared for the most extreme situations – as for a feast and full of yearning for undiscovered worlds and seas, people, and gods; to hearken to all cheerful music as if brave men, soldiers, seafarers were perhaps seeking a short rest and merriment there – and in the deepest pleasure of the moment to be overcome by tears and the whole crimson melancholy of the happy: who would not like all of this to be &lt;em&gt;his&lt;/em&gt; possession, his state! It was the &lt;em&gt;happiness of Homer!&lt;/em&gt; The happiness of the one who invented their gods for the Greeks – I mean, &lt;em&gt;his&lt;/em&gt; gods for himself! But don’t disregard the fact that with this Homeric happiness in one’s soul one is also more capable of suffering than any other creature under the sun! Only at this price can one buy the most precious shell hitherto washed ashore by the waves of existence! As its owner, one becomes ever more refined in pain and eventually too refined; in the end, any slight discontentment and disgust was enough to spoil life for Homer. He had been unable to solve a silly little riddle posed to him by some young fishermen!12 Yes, the little riddles are the danger for those who are happiest!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Two happy ones.&lt;/em&gt; – Truly, despite his youth, this person knows how to &lt;em&gt;improvise life&lt;/em&gt; and amazes even the keenest observer – for he never seems to make a mistake even though he constantly plays the riskiest game. It reminds one of those masters of musical improvisation to whose hands the listener would also like to ascribe a divine &lt;em&gt;infallibility&lt;/em&gt; even though, like every mortal, they make a mistake here and there. But they are practised and inventive and always ready at any moment to incorporate into the thematic order the most accidental note to which the stroke of a finger or a mood drives them, breathing a beautiful meaning and a soul into an accident. Here is an entirely different person: basically everything he wills and plans goes wrong. What occasionally he set his heart on several times brought him to the edge of the abyss and within a hair of destruction; and if he did escape that, it was certainly not just ‘with a black eye.’ Do you believe he is unhappy about this? He decided long ago not to take his own wishes and plans so seriously. ‘If I don’t succeed at this,’ he says to himself, ‘I might succeed at that; and on the whole I don’t know whether I should be more grateful towards my failures than towards any success. Was I made to be stubborn and to have a bull’s horns? That which constitutes the value and outcome of life &lt;em&gt;for me&lt;/em&gt; lies elsewhere; my pride as well as my misery lie elsewhere. I know more about life because I have so often been on the verge of losing it; and precisely therefore do I &lt;em&gt;get&lt;/em&gt; more out of life than any of you!’&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By doing we forgo.&lt;/em&gt; – Basically I abhor every morality that says: ‘Do not do this! Renounce! Overcome yourself!’ But I am well disposed towards those moralities that impel me to do something again and again from morning till evening, and to dream of it at night, and to think of nothing else than doing this &lt;em&gt;well,&lt;/em&gt; as well as &lt;em&gt;I&lt;/em&gt; alone can! When one lives that way, one thing after another that does not belong to such a life drops off: without hate or reluctance one sees this take its leave today and that tomorrow, like the yellow leaves that every faint wisp of wind carries off a tree. Or he does not notice that it takes its leave – so sternly is his eye set on its goal, entirely forwards, not sideways, backwards, downwards. ‘What we do should determine what we forgo; in doing we forgo’ – that’s how I like it; that is &lt;em&gt;my placitum.13&lt;/em&gt; But I do not want to strive for my impoverishment with open eyes; I do not like negative virtues – virtues whose very essence is negation and self-denial.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Self-control.&lt;/em&gt; – Those moralists who command man first and above all to gain control of himself thereby afflict him with a peculiar disease, namely, a constant irritability at all natural stirrings and inclinations and as it were a kind of itch. Whatever may henceforth push, pull, beckon, impel him from within or without will always strike this irritable one as endangering his self-control: no longer may he entrust himself to any instinct or free wing-beat; instead he stands there rigidly with a defensive posture, armed against himself, with sharp and suspicious eyes, the eternal guardian of his fortress, since he has turned himself into a fortress. Indeed, he can become &lt;em&gt;great&lt;/em&gt; this way! But how insufferable he has become to others; how impoverished and cut off from the most beautiful fortuities of the soul! And indeed from all further &lt;em&gt;instruction!&lt;/em&gt; For one must be able at times to lose oneself if one wants to learn something from things that we ourselves are not.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Stoics and Epicureans.&lt;/em&gt; – The Epicurean seeks out the situation, the persons, and even the events that suit his extremely sensitive intellectual constitution; he forgoes the rest – that is, almost everything – because it would be too strong and heavy a diet. The Stoic, by contrast, trains himself to swallow stones and worms, glass shards and scorpions without nausea; he wants his stomach to be ultimately insensible to everything the chance of existence pours into him – he brings to mind the Arabian sect of the Assua that one encounters in Algiers:14 like these insensitive people, he likes to act out his insensitivity before an invited audience, which is precisely what the Epicurean gladly eschews – for he has his ‘garden’!15 Stoicism may well be advisable for those with whom fate improvises and who live in violent times and depend on impulsive and changeable people. But someone who more or less &lt;em&gt;expects&lt;/em&gt; fate to allow him to spin &lt;em&gt;a long thread&lt;/em&gt; does well to take an Epicurean orientation; people engaged in work of the spirit have always done so! For it would be the loss of all losses, for them, to forfeit their subtle sensitivity in exchange for a hard Stoic skin with porcupine spines.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;In favour of criticism.&lt;/em&gt; – Something you formerly loved as a truth or a probability now strikes you as an error; you cast it off and believe your reason has made a victory. But maybe that error was as necessary for you then, when you were still another person – you are always another person – as are all your present ‘truths’, like a skin that concealed and covered many things you weren’t allowed to see yet. It is your new life, not your reason, that has killed that opinion for you: &lt;em&gt;you don’t need it any more,&lt;/em&gt; and now it collapses and unreason crawls out of it into the light like a worm. When we criticize, we are not doing something arbitrary and impersonal; it is, at least very often, proof that there are living, active forces within us shedding skin. We negate and have to negate because something in us &lt;em&gt;wants&lt;/em&gt; to live and affirm itself, something we might not yet know or see! – This in favour of criticism.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The history of every day.&lt;/em&gt; – What is the history of your every day? Consider the habits of which it consists: are they the product of innumerable little cowardices and lazinesses or of your courage and innovative reason? Different as the two cases may be, people could conceivably give you equal praise and you might actually benefit them equally either way. However, praise and benefit and respectability may be enough for those who want merely a good conscience – but not for you who scrupulously examine the inside of things and &lt;em&gt;know about conscience!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;From the seventh solitude.&lt;/em&gt; – One day the wanderer slammed a door shut behind him, came to a halt, and wept. Then he said: ‘This penchant and passion for what is true, real, non-apparent, certain – how it exasperates me! Why does this gloomy and earnest oppressor follow &lt;em&gt;me&lt;/em&gt; of all people! I want to rest, but he won’t allow it. How many things seduce me to linger? Everywhere there are Armida’s gardens16 for me. Thus ever again I must tear myself away and feel another new bitterness in my heart! Once again I must lift my foot, this tired, wounded foot; and having to do so often makes me cast a wrathful glance back at the most beautiful thing that could not hold me – &lt;em&gt;because&lt;/em&gt; it could not hold me!’&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Will and wave.&lt;/em&gt; – How greedily this wave is approaching, as if it were trying to reach something! How it crawls with terrifying haste into the inmost crevices of the craggy gorge! It seems to be trying to arrive before someone else; something of value, of great value, seems to be hidden there. – And now it is returning, a bit more slowly but still quite white with excitement – is it disappointed? Has it found what it was seeking? Is it simulating disappointment? – But already another wave is nearing, still more greedily and wildly than the first; and its soul, too, seems full of secrets and the hunger for treasure-digging. That is how the waves live – that is how we live, we who will – I will say no more. So? You distrust me? You are angry with me, you beautiful monsters? Are you afraid I will divulge your entire secret? Well, be angry with me; raise your dangerous green bodies as high as you can; make a wall between me and the sun – as you are now! Truly, at this moment nothing remains of the world but green dusk and green thunderbolts. Carry on as you want, you high-spirited ones: roar with delight and malice – or dive again, pour your emeralds into the deepest depths, cast your endless white mane of foam and froth over them: everything is fine with me because everything suits you so well, and I love you so for everything – how could I betray &lt;em&gt;you!&lt;/em&gt; For – mark my words! – I know you and your secret; I know your kind! After all, you and I are of one kind! After all, you and I have one secret!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Refracted light.&lt;/em&gt; – One is not always brave; and when one gets tired, one of us, too, is likely one day to lament: ‘It is so hard to hurt people – why is it necessary! What good does it do us to live in seclusion when we don’t want to keep to ourselves what gives offence? Wouldn’t it be more advisable to live in the bustle and to do good to individuals as compensation for the sins that should and must be committed against everyone? To be foolish with fools, vain with the vain, fanatic with the fanatic? Wouldn’t it be fair, given the extravagant degree of deviation on the whole? When I hear of other people’s malice towards me, is not satisfaction the first thing I feel? Quite right! (I seem to be saying to them) I am so little in agreement with you and have so much truth on my side that you might as well have a good day at my expense whenever you can! Here are my faults and mistakes; here is my delusion, my bad taste, my confusion, my tears, my vanity, my owlish seclusion, my contradictions! Here’s something for you to laugh at! So then laugh and be merry! I am not angry with the law and nature of things that want faults and mistakes to cause merriment! To be sure, there have been “more beautiful” times when one could still, with every moderately new idea, feel so &lt;em&gt;indispensable&lt;/em&gt; as to take it out on the street and shout at everyone: “Behold! The kingdom of heaven is at hand!”17 I would not miss myself if I were gone. We are all dispensable!’ But as I said, this is not how we think when we are brave; then we don’t think &lt;em&gt;about that.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;My dog.&lt;/em&gt; – I have named my pain and call it ‘dog’ – it’s just as faithful, just as obtrusive and shameless, just as entertaining, just as clever as every other dog – and I can scold it and take my bad moods out on it the way others do with their dogs, servants, and wives.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;No image of torment.&lt;/em&gt; – I want to follow Raphael’s example and never paint another image of torment. There are enough sublime things; one does not have to seek sublimity where it lives in sisterhood with cruelty; anyway, my ambition would find no satisfaction if I wanted to make myself a sublime torturer.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Or will I go out like a light that no wind blows out, but that grew tired and sated with itself – a burned-out light? Or finally: will I blow myself out lest I burn out? –&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Prophetic human beings.&lt;/em&gt; – You are not sensible to the fact that prophetic human beings are full of suffering; you simply think they have been granted a beautiful ‘gift’ that you yourselves probably would like to have – but I will express myself in a parable. How animals can suffer from electricity in the air and clouds! We see how certain species, for example, monkeys, have a prophetic insight about the weather (as one can observe even in Europe – and not only in zoos, but also on Gibraltar). But we don’t think of the fact that for them, their &lt;em&gt;pains&lt;/em&gt; are prophets for them! When under the influence of an approaching, as yet far from visible cloud a strong positive electrical charge suddenly turns into negative electricity and a change in the weather is impending, these animals act as if an enemy were approaching and prepare for defence or escape. Most often they crawl into hiding – they don’t see bad weather as weather, but as an enemy whose hand they can already &lt;em&gt;feel&lt;/em&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Retrospection.&lt;/em&gt; – While we are living each phase of our lives we rarely recognize its true pathos, but always see it as the only state that is now possible for us and reasonable and – to use some words and a distinction of the Greeks – thoroughly an &lt;em&gt;ethos&lt;/em&gt; and not a &lt;em&gt;pathos.18&lt;/em&gt; Today a few notes of music called back to my memory a winter and a house and a most solitary life, as well as the feeling I lived with: I thought I could continue to live that way forever. But now I understand that it was pathos and passion throughout, comparable to this painful, courageous music which brings certain solace – one is not allowed to possess such things for years at a time, how much the less for eternities: they would make one too ‘overworldly’ for this planet.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Wisdom in pain.&lt;/em&gt; – There is as much wisdom in pain as in pleasure: like pleasure, pain is one of the prime species-preserving forces. If it weren’t, it would have perished long ago: that it hurts is no argument against it – it is its essence. In pain I hear the captain’s command: ‘Pull in the sails!’ The hardy seafarer ‘Man’ must have learned to adjust the sails in a thousand ways; otherwise he would have gone under too quickly and the ocean would have swallowed him too soon. We have to know how to live with reduced energy, too: as soon as pain sounds its safety signal, it is time for such a reduction – some great danger, some storm is approaching, and we do well to ‘inflate ourselves’ as little as possible. True, there are people who hear exactly the opposite command when great pain approaches and who never look as proud, bellicose, and happy as when a storm is nearing – yes, pain itself gives them their greatest moments! They are the heroic human beings, the great &lt;em&gt;pain-bringers&lt;/em&gt; of humanity, those few or rare ones who need the same apology as pain itself – and truly, they should not be denied this! They are eminently species-preserving and species-enhancing forces, if only because they resist comfort and do not hide their nausea at this type of happiness.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;As interpreters of our experiences.&lt;/em&gt; – One type of honesty has been alien to all religion-founders and such: they have not made their experiences a matter of conscience for their knowledge. ‘What did I really experience? What was going on inside and around me? Was my reason bright enough? Was my will turned against all deceptions of the senses and stalwart in warding off the fantastic?’ None of them has asked such questions. Even today, none of our dear religious ones asks them; rather, they have a thirst for things that are &lt;em&gt;contrary to reason&lt;/em&gt; and do not want to make it too hard for themselves to quench it – so they experience ‘miracles’ and ‘rebirths’ and hear the voices of the angels! But we, we others, we reason-thirsty ones, want to face our experiences as sternly as we would a scientific experiment, hour by hour, day by day! We want to be our own experiments and guinea-pigs.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;On meeting again.&lt;/em&gt; – A.: Do I still understand you rightly? You are searching? Where is &lt;em&gt;your&lt;/em&gt; corner and star within the real world? Where can &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt; lie down in the sun so that an abundance of well-being comes to you, too, and your existence justifies itself? Let everyone do that for himself – you seem to me to be saying – and let everyone put out of his mind generalities and worries about others and about society! B: I want more than that; I am no seeker. I want to create for myself a sun of my own.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;New caution.&lt;/em&gt; – Let’s stop thinking so much about punishing, reproaching, and improving! We rarely change an individual; and should we succeed, something else may have been accomplished, unnoticed: &lt;em&gt;we&lt;/em&gt; may have been changed through him! Let’s rather make sure our own influence &lt;em&gt;on all that is to come&lt;/em&gt; balances and outweighs his influence! Let’s not struggle in a direct fight, which is what reproaching, punishing, and desiring to improve amount to. Let’s rather raise ourselves that much higher. Let us give our own example ever more brilliant colours! Let us darken the others through our light! No – let’s not become &lt;em&gt;darker&lt;/em&gt; on their account, like those who punish and are dissatisfied! Let’s sooner step aside! Let us look away!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;In media vita.19&lt;/em&gt; – No, life has not disappointed me. Rather, I find it truer, more desirable and mysterious every year – ever since the day the great liberator overcame me: the thought that life could be an experiment for the knowledge-seeker – not a duty, not a disaster, not a deception! And knowledge itself: let it be something else to others, like a bed to rest on or the way to one, or a diversion or a form of idleness; to me it is a world of dangers and victories in which heroic feelings also have their dance- and playgrounds. ‘&lt;em&gt;Life as a means to knowledge&lt;/em&gt; – with this principle in one’s heart one can not only live bravely but also &lt;em&gt;live gaily and laugh gaily!&lt;/em&gt; And who would know how to laugh and live well who did not first have a good understanding of war and victory?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Being able to suffer is the least; weak women and even slaves often achieve mastery at that. But not to perish of inner distress and uncertainty when one inflicts great suffering and hears the cry of this suffering – that is great; that belongs to greatness.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Soul-doctors and pain.&lt;/em&gt; – All preachers of morals, and all theologians, share one bad habit: they all try to talk people into thinking they are in a very bad way and need some severe, final, radical cure. And since humanity has for centuries far too eagerly lent its ear to these doctrines, something of this superstition of being very badly off has finally stuck, so that they are now only too ready to sigh and find nothing good in life and make sad faces together, as if life were really quite hard to &lt;em&gt;endure.&lt;/em&gt; In reality, they are uninhibitedly sure of and in love with their lives, and are full of innumerable wiles and tricks to get rid of unpleasantness and extract the thorn of pain and misfortune. Talk of pain and misfortune always strikes me as &lt;em&gt;exaggerated,&lt;/em&gt; as if it were a matter of good manners to exaggerate here while deliberately keeping quiet about the fact that there are innumerable palliatives against pain, such as an aesthetics, or the feverish haste of thoughts, or a restful position of the body, or good and bad memories, intentions, hopes, and many types of pride and sympathy, which have nearly the same effect as anaesthesia – and at the highest degrees of pain, unconsciousness automatically takes over. We know quite well how to trickle sweets onto our bitternesses, especially onto the soul’s bitternesses; we find aid in our boldness and sublimity, as well as in the nobler deliriums of submission and resignation. A loss is a loss for barely an hour; somehow it also brings us a gift from heaven – new strength, for example, or at least a new opportunity for strength! What fantasies about the inner ‘miseries’ of evil persons the preachers of morals have concocted! How they have even &lt;em&gt;lied&lt;/em&gt; to us about the unhappiness of passionate people! Yes, ‘lied’ is here the proper term: they knew very well about the superabundant happiness of this type of person, but kept a deathly silence about it, since it constituted a refutation of their theory on which happiness arises only with the annihilation of passion and the silencing of the will! Finally, concerning these soul-doctors’ prescription and their praise for a severe, radical cure, one may ask: is our life really so painful and burdensome that it would be advantageous for us to trade it for a fossilized Stoic way of life? Things are &lt;em&gt;not bad enough&lt;/em&gt; for us that they have to be bad for us in the Stoic style!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Taking seriously.&lt;/em&gt; – For most people, the intellect is an awkward, gloomy, creaking machine that is hard to start: when they want to work with this machine and think well, they call it ‘taking the matter &lt;em&gt;seriously’&lt;/em&gt; – oh, how taxing good thinking must be for them! The lovely human beast seems to lose its good mood when it thinks well; it becomes ‘serious’! And ‘where laughter and gaiety are found, thinking is good for nothing’ – that is the prejudice of this serious beast against all ‘gay science’. Well then, let us prove it a prejudice!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;To harm stupidity.&lt;/em&gt; – Surely the creed concerning the reprehensibility of egoism, preached so stubbornly and with so much conviction, has on the whole harmed egoism (to the advantage of, as I will repeat a hundred times, the herd instincts!) – above all, by depriving egoism of its good conscience and telling us to seek in it the true source of all unhappiness. ‘Your selfishness is the reason your life is miserable (&lt;em&gt;Unheil&lt;/em&gt;)’ – that was preached for millennia and, as I said, harmed selfishness and deprived it of much spirit, much cheerfulness, much inventiveness, much beauty; it made selfishness stupid and ugly and poisoned it! Ancient philosophy, by contrast, taught a quite different main source of misery (&lt;em&gt;Unheil&lt;/em&gt;): from Socrates onwards these thinkers never tired of preaching, ‘Your thoughtlessness and stupidity, your way of living according to the rule, your subordination to the opinion of your neighbour is the reason why you so seldom achieve happiness we thinkers are, as thinkers, the happiest.’ Let us not decide here whether this sermon against stupidity had better reasons on its side than the sermon against selfishness; what is certain, however, is that it deprived stupidity of its good conscience – these philosophers &lt;em&gt;harmed&lt;/em&gt; stupidity.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Leisure and idleness.&lt;/em&gt; – There is something of the American Indian, something of the savagery peculiar to the Indian blood, in the way the Americans strive for gold; and their breathless haste in working – the true vice of the new world – is already starting to spread to old Europe, making it savage and covering it with a most odd mindlessness. Already one is ashamed of keeping still; long reflection almost gives people a bad conscience. One thinks with a watch in hand, as one eats lunch with an eye on the financial pages – one lives like someone who might always ‘miss out on something’. ‘Rather do anything than nothing’ – even this principle is a cord to strangle all culture and all higher taste. Just as all forms are visibly being destroyed by the haste of the workers, so, too, is the feeling for form itself, the ear and eye for the melody of movements. The proof of this lies in the &lt;em&gt;crude obviousness&lt;/em&gt; which is universally demanded in all situations in which people want for once to be honest with others – in their relations with friends, women, relatives, children, teachers, students, leaders, and princes: one no longer has time and energy for ceremony, for civility with detours, for &lt;em&gt;esprit&lt;/em&gt; in conversation, and in general for any otium.20 For life in a hunt for profit constantly forces people to expend their spirit to the point of exhaustion in continual pretence or out-smarting or forestalling others: the true virtue today is doing something in less time than someone else. And thus hours in which honesty is &lt;em&gt;allowed&lt;/em&gt; are rare; during them, however, one is tired and wants not only to ‘let oneself go’ but also to lay oneself down and &lt;em&gt;stretch oneself out&lt;/em&gt; unceremoniously to one’s full length and breadth. This is the way people now write &lt;em&gt;letters,&lt;/em&gt; the style and spirit of which will always be the true ‘sign of the times’. If sociability and the arts still offer any delight, it is the kind of delight that overworked slaves make for themselves. How frugal our educated and uneducated have become concerning ‘joy’! How they are becoming increasingly suspicious of all joy! More and more, &lt;em&gt;work&lt;/em&gt; gets all good conscience on its side; the desire for joy already calls itself a ‘need to recuperate’ and is starting to be ashamed of itself. ‘One owes it to one’s health’ – that is what one says when caught on an excursion in the countryside. Soon we may well reach the point where one can’t give in to the desire for a &lt;em&gt;vita contemplativa21&lt;/em&gt; (that is, taking a walk with ideas and friends) without self-contempt and a bad conscience. Well, formerly it was the other way around: work was afflicted with a bad conscience. A person of good family &lt;em&gt;concealed&lt;/em&gt; the fact that he worked if need compelled him to work. The slave worked under the pressure of the feeling that he was doing something contemptible: ‘doing’ was itself contemptible. ‘Nobility and honour are attached solely to &lt;em&gt;otium&lt;/em&gt; and bellum’22 – that was the ancient prejudice!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Applause.&lt;/em&gt; – A thinker needs no applause and clapping of hands provided he is sure of his own clapping of hands; he cannot do without that. Are there people who can dispense with that, too, and altogether with every kind of applause? I doubt it; and Tacitus, who did not slander the wise, said even of the wisest of men: &lt;em&gt;quando etiam sapientibus gloriae cupido novissima excuitur&lt;/em&gt;23 – which for him means never.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Better deaf than deafened&lt;/em&gt; – Formerly one wanted to be &lt;em&gt;talked&lt;/em&gt; about; that is no longer enough, since the market has grown too large – only a &lt;em&gt;shout&lt;/em&gt; will do. As a result, even good voices shout themselves down, and the best goods are offered by hoarse voices; without the vendors’ cry and hoarseness there is no longer any genius. That is, to be sure, a bad epoch for a thinker; he must learn how to find his own quietude even between two noises, and pretend he is deaf until he really is. As long as he has not learned this, he runs the risk of going to pieces from impatience and headaches.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The evil hour.&lt;/em&gt; – Every philosopher has probably had an evil hour when he thought: What do I matter if people don’t accept my bad arguments, too? And then some malicious little bird flew over him and chirped: ‘What do you matter? What do you matter?’&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;What knowing means. – Non ridere, non lugere, neque detestari, sed intelligere&lt;/em&gt;!24 says Spinoza as simply and sublimely as is his wont. Yet in the final analysis, what is this &lt;em&gt;intelligere&lt;/em&gt; other than the way we become sensible of the other three? A result of the different and conflicting impulses to laugh, lament, and curse? Before knowledge is possible, each of these impulses must first have presented its one-sided view of the thing or event; then comes the fight between these one-sided views, and occasionally out of it a mean, an appeasement, a concession to all three sides, a kind of justice and contract; for in virtue of justice and a contract all these impulses can assert and maintain themselves in existence and each can finally feel it is in the right vis-à-vis all the others. Since only the ultimate reconciliation scenes and final accounts of this long process rise to consciousness, we suppose that &lt;em&gt;intelligere&lt;/em&gt; must be something conciliatory, just, and good, something essentially opposed to the instincts, when in fact &lt;em&gt;it is only a certain behaviour of the drives towards one another.&lt;/em&gt; For the longest time, conscious thought was considered thought itself; only now does the truth dawn on us that by far the greatest part of our mind’s activity proceeds unconscious and unfelt; but I think these drives which here fight each other know very well how to make themselves felt by and how to hurt &lt;em&gt;each other.&lt;/em&gt; This may well be the source of that great and sudden exhaustion that afflicts all thinkers (it is the exhaustion of the battlefield). Indeed, there may be many hidden instances for &lt;em&gt;heroism&lt;/em&gt; in our warring depths, but certainly nothing divine, eternally resting in itself, as Spinoza supposed. &lt;em&gt;Conscious&lt;/em&gt; thought, especially that of the philosopher, is the least vigorous and therefore also the relatively mildest and calmest type of thought; and thus precisely philosophers are most easily led astray about the nature of knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;One must learn to love.&lt;/em&gt; – This happens to us in music: first one must &lt;em&gt;learn to hear&lt;/em&gt; a figure and melody at all, to detect and distinguish it, to isolate and delimit it as a life in itself; then one needs effort and good will to &lt;em&gt;stand&lt;/em&gt; it despite its strangeness; patience with its appearance and expression, and kindheartedness about its oddity. Finally comes a moment when we are &lt;em&gt;used&lt;/em&gt; to it; when we expect it; when we sense that we’d miss it if it were missing; and now it continues relentlessly to compel and enchant us until we have become its humble and enraptured lovers, who no longer want anything better from the world than it and it again. But this happens to us not only in music: it is in just this way that we have &lt;em&gt;learned to love&lt;/em&gt; everything we now love. We are always rewarded in the end for our good will, our patience, our fair-mindedness and gentleness with what is strange, as it gradually casts off its veil and presents itself as a new and indescribable beauty. That is &lt;em&gt;its thanks&lt;/em&gt; for our hospitality. Even he who loves himself will have learned it this way – there is no other way. Love, too, must be learned.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Long live physics!&lt;/em&gt; – So, how many people know how to observe? And of these few, how many to observe themselves? ‘Everyone is farthest from himself’25 – every person who is expert at scrutinizing the inner life of others knows this to his own chagrin; and the saying, ‘Know thyself’, addressed to human beings by a god, is near to malicious.26 &lt;em&gt;That&lt;/em&gt; self-observation is in such a bad state, however, is most clearly confirmed by the way in which &lt;em&gt;nearly everyone&lt;/em&gt; speaks of the nature of a moral act – that quick, willing, convinced, talkative manner, with its look, its smile, its obliging eagerness! People seem to be wanting to say to you, ‘But my dear fellow, that is precisely &lt;em&gt;my&lt;/em&gt; subject! You are directing your question to the person who is &lt;em&gt;competent&lt;/em&gt; to answer it: there is, as it happens, nothing I am wiser about. So: when man judges &lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;that is right&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt; and infers &lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;hence it must come about!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt; and then &lt;em&gt;does&lt;/em&gt; what he thus has recognized to be right and described as necessary – then the nature of his act is &lt;em&gt;moral&lt;/em&gt;!’ But, my friend, you are speaking of three acts instead of one: even the judgement ‘that is right’, for example, is an act. Wouldn’t it be possible for a person to make a judgement in a way that would be moral or immoral? &lt;em&gt;Why&lt;/em&gt; do you take this and specifically this to be right? ‘Because my conscience tells me so; conscience never speaks immorally, since it determines what is to count as moral!’ But why do you &lt;em&gt;listen&lt;/em&gt; to the words of your conscience? And what gives you the right to consider such a judgement true and infallible? For this belief – is there no conscience? Do you know nothing of an intellectual conscience? A conscience behind your ‘conscience’? Your judgement, ‘that is right’ has a prehistory in your drives, inclinations, aversions, experiences, and what you have failed to experience; you have to ask, &lt;em&gt;‘how&lt;/em&gt; did it emerge there?’ and then also, &lt;em&gt;‘what&lt;/em&gt; is really impelling me to listen to it?’ You can listen to its commands like a good soldier who heeds the command of his officer. Or like a woman who loves the one who commands. Or like a flatterer and coward who fears the commander. Or like a fool who obeys because he can think of no objection. In short, there are a hundred ways to listen to your conscience. But &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; you hear this or that judgement as the words of conscience, i.e. &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; you feel something to be right may have its cause in your never having thought much about yourself and in your blindly having accepted what has been labelled &lt;em&gt;right&lt;/em&gt; since your childhood; or in the fact that fulfilling your duties has so far brought you bread and honours – and you consider it right because it appears to you as &lt;em&gt;your own&lt;/em&gt; ‘condition of existence’ (and that you have a &lt;em&gt;right&lt;/em&gt; to existence seems irrefutable to you). For all that, the &lt;em&gt;firmness&lt;/em&gt; of your moral judgement could be evidence of your personal wretchedness, of lack of a personality; your ‘moral strength’ might have its source in your stubbornness – or in your inability to envisage new ideals. And, briefly, had you reflected more subtly, observed better, and studied more, you would never continue to call this ‘duty’ of yours and this ‘conscience’ of yours duty and conscience. Your insight into &lt;em&gt;how such things as moral judgements could ever have come into existence&lt;/em&gt; would spoil these emotional words for you, as other emotional words, for example, ‘sin’, ‘salvation of the soul’, and ‘redemption’ have been spoiled for you. And now don’t bring up the categorical imperative, my friend! The term tickles my ear and makes me laugh despite your very serious presence. I am reminded of old Kant, who helped himself to (&lt;em&gt;erschlichen&lt;/em&gt;) the ‘thing in itself’ – another very ridiculous thing! – and was punished for this when the ‘categorical imperative’ crept into (&lt;em&gt;beschlichen&lt;/em&gt;) his heart and made him stray back to ‘God’, ‘soul’, ‘freedom’, ‘immortality’, like a fox who strays back into his cage. Yet it had been &lt;em&gt;his&lt;/em&gt; strength and cleverness that had &lt;em&gt;broken open&lt;/em&gt; the cage!27 What? You admire the categorical imperative within you? This ‘firmness’ of your so-called moral judgement? This absoluteness of the feeling, ‘here everyone must judge as I do’? Rather admire your &lt;em&gt;selfishness&lt;/em&gt; here! And the blindness, pettiness, and simplicity of your selfishness! For it is selfish to consider one’s own judgement a universal law, and this selfishness is blind, petty, and simple because it shows that you haven’t yet discovered yourself or created for yourself an ideal of your very own – for this could never be someone else’s, let alone everyone’s, everyone’s! No one who judges, ‘in this case everyone would have to act like this’ has yet taken five steps towards self-knowledge. For he would then know that there neither are nor can be actions that are all the same; that every act ever performed was done in an altogether unique and unrepeatable way, and that this will be equally true of every future act; that all prescriptions of action (even the most inward and subtle rules of all moralities so far) relate only to their rough exterior; that these prescriptions may yield an appearance of sameness, &lt;em&gt;but only just an appearance;&lt;/em&gt; that as one observes or recollects &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; action, it is and remains impenetrable; that our opinions about ‘good’ and ‘noble’ and ‘great’ can never be &lt;em&gt;proven true&lt;/em&gt; by our actions because every act is unknowable; that our opinions, valuations, and tables of what is good are certainly some of the most powerful levers in the machinery of our actions, but that in each case, the law of its mechanism is unprovable. Let us therefore &lt;em&gt;limit&lt;/em&gt; ourselves to the purification of our opinions and value judgements and to the &lt;em&gt;creation of tables of what is good that are new and all our own:&lt;/em&gt; let us stop brooding over the ‘moral value of our actions’! Yes, my friends, it is time to feel nauseous about some people’s moral chatter about others. Sitting in moral judgement should offend our taste. Let us leave such chatter and such bad taste to those who have nothing to do but drag the past a few steps further through time and who never live in the present – that is, to the many, the great majority! We, however, want to &lt;em&gt;become who we are&lt;/em&gt; – human beings who are new, unique, incomparable, who give themselves laws, who create themselves! To that end we must become the best students and discoverers of everything lawful and necessary in the world: we must become &lt;em&gt;physicists&lt;/em&gt; in order to be creators in this sense – while hitherto all valuations and ideals have been built on &lt;em&gt;ignorance&lt;/em&gt; of physics or in &lt;em&gt;contradiction&lt;/em&gt; to it. So, long live physics! And even more long live what &lt;em&gt;compels&lt;/em&gt; us to it – our honesty!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The ‘humanity’ of the future.&lt;/em&gt; – When I view this age with the eyes of a distant age, I can find nothing odder in present-day man than his peculiar virtue and disease called ‘the sense for history’. This is the beginning of something completely new and strange in history: if one gave this seed a few centuries and more, it might ultimately become a wonderful growth with an equally wonderful smell that could make our old earth more agreeable to inhabit. We present-day humans are just beginning to form the chain of a very powerful future feeling, link by link – we hardly know what we are doing. It seems to us almost as if we are dealing not with a new feeling but with a decrease in all old feelings: the sense for history is still something so poor and cold, and many are struck by it as by a frost and made even poorer and colder by it. To others it appears as the sign of old age creeping up, and they see our planet as a melancholy sick man who chronicles his youth in order to forget his present condition. Indeed, that is one colour of this new feeling: he who is able to feel the history of man altogether as his own history feels in a monstrous generalization all the grief of the invalid thinking of health, of the old man thinking of the dreams of his youth, of the lover robbed of his beloved, of the martyr whose ideal is perishing, of the hero on the eve after a battle that decided nothing but brought him wounds and the loss of a friend. But to bear and to be able to bear this monstrous sum of all kinds of grief and still be the hero who, on the second day of battle, greets dawn and his fortune as a person whose horizon stretches millennia before and behind him, as the dutiful heir to all the nobility of past spirit, as the most aristocratic of old nobles and at the same time the first of a new nobility the likes of which no age has ever seen or dreamt: to take this upon one’s soul – the oldest, the newest, losses, hopes, conquests, victories of humanity. To finally take all this in one soul and compress it into one feeling – this would surely have to produce a happiness unknown to humanity so far: a divine happiness full of power and love, full of tears and laughter, a happiness which, like the sun in the evening, continually draws on its inexhaustible riches, giving them away and pouring them into the sea, a happiness which, like the evening sun, feels richest when even the poorest fisherman is rowing with a golden oar! This divine feeling would then be called – humanity!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The will to suffer and those who feel compassion.&lt;/em&gt; – Is it good for you yourselves to be above all else compassionate persons? And is it good for those who suffer if you are compassionate? But let us leave the first question unanswered for a moment. What we most deeply and most personally suffer from is incomprehensible and inaccessible to nearly everyone else; here we are hidden from our nearest, even if we eat from the same pot. But whenever we are &lt;em&gt;noticed&lt;/em&gt; to be suffering, our suffering is superficially construed; it is the essence of the feeling of compassion that it &lt;em&gt;strips&lt;/em&gt; the suffering of what is truly personal: our ‘benefactors’ diminish our worth and our will more than our enemies do. In most cases of beneficence toward those in distress there is something offensive in the intellectual frivolity with which the one who feels compassion plays the role of fate: he knows nothing of the whole inner sequence and interconnection that spells misfortune for &lt;em&gt;me&lt;/em&gt; or for you! The entire economy of my soul and the balance effected by ‘misfortune’, the breaking open of new springs and needs, the healing of old wounds, the shedding of entire periods of the past – all such things that can be involved in misfortune do not concern the dear compassionate one: they want to &lt;em&gt;help&lt;/em&gt; and have no thought that there is a personal necessity of misfortune; that terrors, deprivations, impoverishments, midnights, adventures, risks, and blunders are as necessary for me and you as their opposites; indeed, to express myself mystically, that the path to one’s own heaven always leads through the voluptuousness of one’s own hell. No, they know nothing of that: the ‘religion of compassion’ (or ‘the heart’) commands them to help, and they believe they have helped best when they have helped most quickly! Should you adherents to this religion really have the same attitude towards yourselves that you have towards your fellow men; should you refuse to let your suffering lie on you even for an hour and instead constantly prevent all possible misfortune ahead of time; should you experience suffering and displeasure as evil, hateful, deserving of annihilation, as a defect of existence, then you have besides your religion of pity also another religion in your hearts; and the latter is perhaps the mother of the former – &lt;em&gt;the religion of snug cosiness.&lt;/em&gt; Oh, how little do you know of the &lt;em&gt;happiness&lt;/em&gt; of man, you comfortable and good-natured ones! For happiness and misfortune (&lt;em&gt;Glück und Unglück&lt;/em&gt;) are two siblings and twins who either grow up together or – as with you – &lt;em&gt;remain small&lt;/em&gt; together! But now back to the first question. How is it possible to keep to &lt;em&gt;one’s own&lt;/em&gt; path! Some clamour is constantly calling us aside; rarely does our eye see something there that does not make it necessary to drop our own occupation instantly and spring to assistance. I know, there are a hundred decent and praiseworthy ways of losing myself&lt;em&gt;from my path,&lt;/em&gt; and, verily, highly ‘moral’ ways! Yes, the moral teacher of compassion even goes so far as to hold that precisely this and only this is moral – to lose &lt;em&gt;one’s own&lt;/em&gt; way like this in order to help a neighbour. I, too, know with certainty that I need only to expose myself to the sight of real distress and I, too, &lt;em&gt;am&lt;/em&gt; lost! If a suffering friend said to me, ‘Look, I am about to die; please promise to die with me’, I would promise it; likewise, the sight of a small mountain tribe fighting for its freedom would make me offer my hand and my life – for once to choose bad examples, for good reasons. Yes, there is a secret seduction even in all these things which arouse compassion and cry out for help, for our own way is so hard and demanding and so far from love and gratitude of others that we are by no means reluctant to escape from it, from it and our ownmost conscience – and take refuge in the conscience of the others and in the lovely temple of the ‘religion of compassion’. As soon as any war breaks out, precisely the noblest men in the population immediately begin to experience a delight which is, to be sure, kept secret: they throw themselves rapturously into the new danger of &lt;em&gt;death&lt;/em&gt; because it seems to offer them that long-desired permission – the permission &lt;em&gt;to deviate from their goal;&lt;/em&gt; war offers them a detour to suicide, but a detour with a good conscience. And, although I will keep quiet here about some things, I do not wish to keep quiet about my morality, which tells me: Live in seclusion so that you &lt;em&gt;are able&lt;/em&gt; to live for yourself! Live &lt;em&gt;in ignorance&lt;/em&gt; of what seems most important to your age! Lay at least the skin of three hundred years between you and today! And let the clamour of today, the noise of war and revolutions, be but a murmur to you. You will also want to help – but only those whose distress you properly &lt;em&gt;understand&lt;/em&gt; because they share with you one suffering and one hope – your &lt;em&gt;friends&lt;/em&gt; – and only in the way you help yourself: I want to make them braver, more persevering, simpler, more full of gaiety. I want to teach them what is today understood by so few, least of all by these preachers of compassion (&lt;em&gt;Mitleiden):&lt;/em&gt; to share not pain, but &lt;em&gt;joy (Mitfreude)!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Vita femina&lt;/em&gt;.28 – Not even all knowledge and all good will suffice for seeing the ultimate beauties of a work; it requires the rarest of lucky accidents for the clouds that veil the peaks to lift for us momentarily and for the sun to shine on them. Not only must we stand in just the right spot to see this, but our own soul, too, must itself have pulled the veil from its heights and must have been in need of some external expression and parable, as if it needed a hold in order to retain control of itself. But so rarely does all of this coincide that I am inclined to believe that the highest peaks of everything good, be it work, deed, humanity, or nature, have so far remained hidden and covered from the majority and even from the best. But what does unveil itself for us &lt;em&gt;unveils itself for us only once!&lt;/em&gt; The Greeks, to be sure, prayed: ‘Everything beautiful twice and thrice!’29 Indeed, they had good reason to summon the gods, for ungodly reality gives us the beautiful either never or only once! I mean to say that the world is brimming with beautiful things but nevertheless poor, very poor in beautiful moments and in the unveilings of those things. But perhaps that is the strongest magic of life: it is covered by a veil of beautiful possibilities, woven with threads of gold – promising, resisting, bashful, mocking, compassionate, and seductive. Yes, life is a woman!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;*The dying Socrates.*30 – I admire the courage and wisdom of Socrates in everything he did, said – and did not say. This mocking, love-sick monster and pied piper of Athens, who made the most audacious youths of Athens tremble and sob, was not only the wisest chatterer of all time; he was equally great in silence. I wish he had remained silent also in the last moments of his life – perhaps he would then belong to a still higher order of minds. Whether it was death or the poison or piety or malice – something loosened his tongue and he said: ‘O Crito, I owe Asclepius a rooster.’ This ridiculous and terrible ‘last word’ means for those who have ears: ‘O Crito, &lt;em&gt;life is a disease&lt;/em&gt;.’31 Is it possible that a man like him, who had lived cheerfully and like a soldier in plain view of everyone, was a pessimist? He had merely kept a cheerful demeanour while all his life hiding his ultimate judgement, his inmost feeling! Socrates, Socrates &lt;em&gt;suffered from life!&lt;/em&gt; And then he still avenged himself – with this veiled, gruesome, pious, and blasphemous saying. Did a Socrates really need &lt;em&gt;revenge?&lt;/em&gt; Was there one ounce too little magnanimity in his overabundant virtue? – O friends! We must overcome even the Greeks!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The heaviest weight.&lt;/em&gt; –&lt;br&gt;&#xA;What if some day or night a demon were to steal into your loneliest loneliness and say to you:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;‘This life as you now live it and have lived it&lt;br&gt;&#xA;you will have to live once again and innumerable times again;&lt;br&gt;&#xA;and there will be nothing new in it,&lt;br&gt;&#xA;but every pain and every joy and every thought and sigh and everything unspeakably small or great in your life must return to you,&lt;br&gt;&#xA;all in the same succession and sequence – even this spider and this moonlight between the trees,&lt;br&gt;&#xA;and even this moment and I myself.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;The eternal hourglass of existence is turned over again and again,&lt;br&gt;&#xA;and you with it, speck of dust!’&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Incipit tragoedia.32&lt;/em&gt; – When Zarathustra33 was thirty years old, he left his homeland and Lake Urmi and went into the mountains. There he enjoyed his spirit and solitude, and did not tire of that for ten years. But at last his heart changed – and one morning he arose with rosy dawn, stepped before the sun, and spoke to it thus: ‘You great heavenly body! What would your happiness be if you did not have those for whom you shine! For ten years you have climbed up to my cave; without me, my eagle, and my snake, you would have become tired of your light and of this road; but we awaited you every morning, relieved you of your overabundance, and blessed you for it. Behold, I am sick of my wisdom, like a bee that has collected too much honey; I need outstretched hands; I would like to give away and distribute until the wise among humans once again enjoy their folly and the poor once again their riches. For that I must step into the depths, as you do in the evening when you go behind the sea and bring light even to the underworld, you over-rich heavenly body! Like you I must &lt;em&gt;go under,&lt;/em&gt; as it is called by the human beings to whom I want to descend. So bless me then, you calm eye that can look without envy upon all-too-great happiness! Bless the cup that wants to overflow in order that the water may flow golden from it and everywhere carry the reflection of your bliss! Behold, this cup wants to become empty again, and Zarathustra wants to become human again.’ Thus began Zarathustra’s going under.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
