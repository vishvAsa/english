*Faith in oneself.* – Few people have faith in themselves – and of these few, some possess it as a useful blindness or partial eclipse of the mind \(what would they behold if they could see the bottom of themselves\!\), while the rest have to acquire it. Everything good, fine, or great they do is first of all an argument against the sceptic inside them. They have to convince or persuade *him,* and that almost requires genius. These are the great self-dissatisfied people.
