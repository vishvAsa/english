*Preparatory human beings.* – I welcome all the signs of a more virile, warlike age approaching that will above all restore honour to bravery\! For it shall pave the way for a still higher age and gather the strength that the latter will need one day – the age that will carry heroism into the search for knowledge and *wage wars* for the sake of thoughts and their consequences. To this end we now need many preparatory brave human beings who surely cannot spring from nothingness any more than from the sand and slime of present-day civilization and urbanization: human beings who know how to be silent, lonely, determined, and satisfied and steadfast in invisible activities; human beings profoundly predisposed to look, in all things, for what must be *overcome;* human beings whose cheerfulness, patience, modesty, and contempt for great vanities is just as distinctive as their magnanimity in victory and patience with the small vanities of the defeated; human beings with a sharp and free judgement concerning all victors and the share of chance in every victory and glory; human beings with their own festivals, their own working days, their own periods of mourning, accustomed to command with assurance and equally prepared, when called for, to obey – in each case, equally proud, equally serving their own cause; more endangered, more fruitful, happier human beings\! For – believe me – the secret for harvesting from existence the greatest fruitfulness and the greatest enjoyment is – *to live dangerously\!* Build your cities on the slopes of Vesuvius\! Send your ships into uncharted seas\! Live at war with your peers and yourselves\! Be robbers and conquerors as long as you cannot be rulers and possessors, you seekers of knowledge\! Soon the time will be past in which you had to be content living hidden in forests like shy deer\! Finally the search for knowledge will reach for its due; it will want to rule and possess, and you with it\!
