*By doing we forgo.* – Basically I abhor every morality that says: ‘Do not do this\! Renounce\! Overcome yourself\!’ But I am well disposed towards those moralities that impel me to do something again and again from morning till evening, and to dream of it at night, and to think of nothing else than doing this *well,* as well as *I* alone can\! When one lives that way, one thing after another that does not belong to such a life drops off: without hate or reluctance one sees this take its leave today and that tomorrow, like the yellow leaves that every faint wisp of wind carries off a tree. Or he does not notice that it takes its leave – so sternly is his eye set on its goal, entirely forwards, not sideways, backwards, downwards. ‘What we do should determine what we forgo; in doing we forgo’ – that’s how I like it; that is *my placitum.13* But I do not want to strive for my impoverishment with open eyes; I do not like negative virtues – virtues whose very essence is negation and self-denial.
