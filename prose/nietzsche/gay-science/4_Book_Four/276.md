*For the new year.* – I’m still alive; I still think: I must still be alive because I still have to think. *Sum, ergo cogito: cogito, ergo sum.*1 Today everyone allows himself to express his dearest wish and thoughts: so I, too, want to say what I wish from myself today and what thought first crossed my heart – what thought shall be the reason, warrant, and sweetness of the rest of my life\! I want to learn more and more how to see what is necessary in things as what is beautiful in them – thus I will be one of those who make things beautiful. *Amor fati:*2 let that be my love from now on\! I do not want to wage war against ugliness. I do not want to accuse; I do not even want to accuse the accusers. Let *looking away* be my only negation\! And, all in all and on the whole: some day I want only to be a Yes-sayer\!
