*Get on the ships\!* – If one considers how an overall philosophical justification of one’s way of living and thinking affects each individual – namely, like a sun, warming, blessing, impregnating, shining especially for him; how it makes him independent of praise and blame, self-sufficient, rich, generous with happiness and good will; how it incessantly turns evil into good, brings all forces to bloom and ripen and keeps the petty, great weed of melancholy and moroseness from coming up at all – one exclaims longingly, in the end: Oh, how I wish that many such new suns would yet be created\! Even the evil man, the unhappy man, and the exceptional man should have their philosophy, their good right, their sunshine\! Pity for them is not what is needed\! We have to unlearn this arrogant notion, however long humanity has spent learning and practising it – we do not need to present them with confessors, conjurers of souls, and forgivers of sins; rather, a new *justice* is needed\! And a new motto\! And new philosophers\! The moral earth, too, is round\! The moral earth, too, has its antipodes\! The antipodes, too, have their right to exist\! There is another world to discover – and more than one\! On to the ships, you philosophers\!
