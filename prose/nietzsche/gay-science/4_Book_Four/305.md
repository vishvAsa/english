*Self-control.* â€“ Those moralists who command man first and above all to gain control of himself thereby afflict him with a peculiar disease, namely, a constant irritability at all natural stirrings and inclinations and as it were a kind of itch. Whatever may henceforth push, pull, beckon, impel him from within or without will always strike this irritable one as endangering his self-control: no longer may he entrust himself to any instinct or free wing-beat; instead he stands there rigidly with a defensive posture, armed against himself, with sharp and suspicious eyes, the eternal guardian of his fortress, since he has turned himself into a fortress. Indeed, he can become *great* this way\! But how insufferable he has become to others; how impoverished and cut off from the most beautiful fortuities of the soul\! And indeed from all further *instruction\!* For one must be able at times to lose oneself if one wants to learn something from things that we ourselves are not.
