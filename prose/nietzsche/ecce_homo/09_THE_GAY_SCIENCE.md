title = "09 THE GAY SCIENCE"

+++

‘DAYBREAK’ is an affirmative book, profound but bright and benevolent. The same applies once again and in the highest degree to the *gaya scienza:* in practically every sentence of this book profundity and exuberance go hand in hand. A poem which expresses gratitude for the most wonderful month of January I have ever experienced – the entire book is a gift – betrays out of what a depth ‘science’ has here become *gay:*



You who with your spear of fire

Melt the river of my soul,

So that, freed from ice, it rushes

Toward the ocean of its goal:

Brighter still and still more healthy,

Free in most desired constraint –

Thus your miracle it praises,

January, lovely saint\!



As to what is here called ‘goal’ – who can be in any doubt as to what this means who sees glittering at the conclusion of the fourth book the diamond beauty of the opening words of Zarathustra? – Or who reads at the end of the third book the granite sentences with which a destiny for *all ages* formulates itself for the first time. – Songs of Prince Vogelfrei, composed for the most part in Sicily, call to mind quite explicitly the Provençal concept of ‘*gaya scienza*’, that union of *minstrel, knight and free-spirit* by which that marvellous early culture of the Provençals is distinguished from all ambiguous cultures; the last poem of all especially, ‘*to the Mistral*’, an exuberant dance-song in which, if I may say so\! I dance right over morality, is a perfect Provençalism. –
