## The Order
I remember not being able to articulate the ṛ phoneme, and so when the old man said, "ṛtaṃ ca satyaṃ ca," I said, 'litam ca satyaṃ ca."+++(4)+++ I must have been four or five. I never thought of what they meant. I was supposed to sing these old songs so many times that every cell in my body was supposed to savor the memory. It was not reciting the mantras but reliving the recollections of hundreds of generations.

I have often failed to capture the dynamism when balancing myself in satya. It is as if one slips away or fades away when I embrace the other. Yāska could capture both, as he saw materialization as completion of the dynamism that makes action possible. Some notice the flow and the others the water; some see matter and the others, energy. Old man saw both. And so he was a paradox for all. He was at the same time attached and completely detached.+++(5)+++ When he told me how to plant corns, he was teaching me how to be a teacher.

There, I believe, is an order of things, the way they are. This does not mean that I have to like it or accept it. I may be the extension of ṛta that was ought to be maintained, and I may strive to maintain it, this does not mean that ṛta could not have consolidated into matter.

Kālidāsa saw life as an aberration and death as the natural course. For three decades, old man waited in the porch, in front of the shrine that he built for meditation, counting hours and days, for no time, negation of being, of non-being. And he told me one day, his waiting has been over. Even though I now can differentiate ṛ and l, I am still mixed up between ṛta and satya. May be one day he will teach me more when we meet again.+++(5)+++

## West Nepal
Nostalgia.

It was around 1998 that I made my first trip to the western region of Nepal. Acham is a lovely place. Kalikot, of course. I was with brother Shanti Krishna for the trip to Dailekh. Long bus ride to Surkhet was nothing compared to the rest of the way. They had just started cutting the edge of the tall mountains to make a gravel road. The road was not finished but still then they were running bus service. When we were on top, the valley of Surkhet paralleled Amaravati. But the fun was marred by a quick jolt and by the time we were aware of the situation, the front right wheel of our bus was out of the road and the bus was tilting towards the slope. In seconds our next destination was going to be three thousand feet below.

Fortunately we managed to walk out of the bus. The driver stubbornly stayed in his seat, maneuvering the wheels. Two of his associates had some strong ropes and in no time, we all were pulling our bus. The workers heard the noise and a dozen helping hands appeared. In an hour or so, they fixed the slope, and the bus was eventually pulled out. I asked one worker, how good is the road ahead, and he said, it gets worse and worse.

We chose to walk. The locals were used to this and so they stayed in the bus. For, they had already paid for it, so why not to take a chance. This was also my first chance to see the origins of Timalsinas in the far west of Nepal.

## Mukti Adhikari
Mukti Adhikari, my colleague during the college days, was murdered by the Maoists 18 years ago today. I only got a head injury and some death threats, but my friend was not that lucky. Our only crime was teaching Sanskrit.

## horror house
if you are divinely inspired, the best thing you could do is to write horror stories so real that every reader gets nightmares and finds it hard to come out of them. look around yourself, look what god has achieved. this is the only way you can make god jealous.
