## The Order
I remember not being able to articulate the ṛ phoneme, and so when the old man said, "ṛtaṃ ca satyaṃ ca," I said, 'litam ca satyaṃ ca."+++(4)+++ I must have been four or five. I never thought of what they meant. I was supposed to sing these old songs so many times that every cell in my body was supposed to savor the memory. It was not reciting the mantras but reliving the recollections of hundreds of generations.

I have often failed to capture the dynamism when balancing myself in satya. It is as if one slips away or fades away when I embrace the other. Yāska could capture both, as he saw materialization as completion of the dynamism that makes action possible. Some notice the flow and the others the water; some see matter and the others, energy. Old man saw both. And so he was a paradox for all. He was at the same time attached and completely detached.+++(5)+++ When he told me how to plant corns, he was teaching me how to be a teacher.

There, I believe, is an order of things, the way they are. This does not mean that I have to like it or accept it. I may be the extension of ṛta that was ought to be maintained, and I may strive to maintain it, this does not mean that ṛta could not have consolidated into matter.

Kālidāsa saw life as an aberration and death as the natural course. For three decades, old man waited in the porch, in front of the shrine that he built for meditation, counting hours and days, for no time, negation of being, of non-being. And he told me one day, his waiting has been over. Even though I now can differentiate ṛ and l, I am still mixed up between ṛta and satya. May be one day he will teach me more when we meet again.+++(5)+++

## horror house
if you are divinely inspired, the best thing you could do is to write horror stories so real that every reader gets nightmares and finds it hard to come out of them. look around yourself, look what god has achieved. this is the only way you can make god jealous.

## Lyft
I woke up with a non-stop ringing just to realize it was my son who was supposed to arrive from Seattle last night. I checked time and it was one in the morning. His flight was arriving at midnight and so he was kind in telling us that he will take a Lyft. We were meant to see each other only in the morning. The story I heard from Gayatri and Ishan completely woke me up. And like many of my stories, this also touches the boundaries of the real and the surreal.

The elderly lady who picked him up and other passengers started driving in different directions, entered the wrong way, and drove through different lanes without a seat belt. She stopped in different gas stations but insisted someone else has to fill up the tank. While the passengers were unsure what to do, she told them the story of how she killed a guy three months ago in a car crash and it was not her fault. And she threatened the passengers that if anybody were to write a negative review, she knows their address.

Not knowing what to do, Ishan ran when the lady stopped the car for another passenger. In the middle of the night, he ran several blocks so that the crazy lady does not follow.

## The maple tree
I cannot miss this lonely maple tree as I walk to the class. The screen of consciousness as if remains blurred while going to the class but when I return, the tree appears again; this time more pronounced than before. This may be the only tree to tell me about the fall, the dark red that I encountered while in Weimar and in St. Louis. A leaf falls as I walk by, as if summoning me to stay for a while.

Many seasons have passed since I have stopped noticing the change. Life is not even a stream but just a routine;+++(5)+++ all we do is repeat the life that we once lived decades ago. This makes life bearable as we can sleep-walk through the  reality. We have already plastered smile to our face and have swallowed the poison of life, there is nothing confronting us to evoke the core of our being. And we have comfortably conditioned our being with the chores that we live for. This maple tree wants to shake my core, to make me recall the days when I used to encounter the seasons and when I used to fly in the fantasy land of my own creation.

The life we have carved has no seasons. This flows forever till it stops altogether. We are blind when it comes to noticing the recurring events, the cycles that the pagans celebrated in their ecstatic ayahuasca dance. We have the timers; we have digitized time as it helps us forget the recurrence. This helps us live in the fantasy that all that surrounds us is completely new. If not from our clinging, this helps us achieve nirvana from our memories.

But there stands a lonely maple tree defying the stream, mocking the routine. And the fallen leaf confronts me as if a mirror. The leaf is too heavy for me to carry, as this is sapped with the memories from the past. I escape the maple tree as this is much easier than to drive again through the streets that I walked long time ago.


## The coral tree

I felt for over a week I have lost something. Because I could not identify what it was, it made the loss all the more unbearable. Forgetting is not just the lapse of the memory of some objects; it is a loss of part of yourself, the part entangled with another time. And the loss of yourself, a part integral to you, causes grief. This is a different type of grief; this is a non-directional grief. The grief that I myself do not know what for. There is just darkness, but I am not grieving the presence of this darkness. This darkness is merely a signpost for what used to be there.

The other evening, I realized the coral tree that used to be there in the next block corner was no more. And then I saw the first light. It was the loss of the coral tree accompanied with my lack of awareness of it being removed that was dragging my being. I know the coral tree is gone and I know my memory will also fade away, I just needed to realize it for one time before its being was erased. We both deserved a farewell.+++(5)+++

## The First Day
My first day of school was also the first day of the school itself. We were some twelve kids with three teachers. I do not recollect any of their faces but vaguely remember the names. Since there was no school building, we were gathered around a giant Pippala tree. Class one, literacy; Class two, advanced literacy; Class three, more literacy. Since they only had three classes, they dumped me in the third.

I believe one teacher opened a restaurant later for a living. There was another teacher who wore a wrist watch and had a horse. At the end of the day, he challenged me to recite five chapters from the Vedas, and upon completion, he gave me his day's earning.+++(5)+++ My father was not happy about the episode, as he thought I was betting on my knowledge and squeezing teachers.+++(4)+++ The next day, he made me return that money.+++(5)+++ There were some rocks for us to sit but the slope in one edge was very steep, making me giddy.

I found no passion in the class as I already knew what they were teaching. All I could think of was the transparent waters flowing in Thopal whispering into my ears, daring me to run out of the class and dive deep. Mango trees loaded with green fruits down the slope glittered in the sunlight, making my mouth water.

Reflecting back, I love this day for teaching me apoha, negation. Schools are not there to teach us something new. They are there to teach us negating our being and to look for the idea of freedom by negating freedom.+++(5)+++

## Spiritual Activism
I have been closely following the postings of some of my friends and I read the comments from some friends as to why should a  teacher, a philosopher, or a visionary bother what is happening in the mundane world: this has always been a messy fish eating fish world any way. I lived in the same mindset for a good part of my life. I have come to the realization that silence and retrieval to the cave is not an answer. I for one do not speak to influence others and I mean it. I have not even written my books to influence people. This is not my model. I have no missionary zeal. Writing is a mode of speaking, and speech is thought in crystalized form. I speak because it helps me become what I want to be. I have to speak because the inner me expresses through speech. And through my speech I constitute myself.+++(4)+++ My activism help me realize who I am and the ways I can discover my higher being.
