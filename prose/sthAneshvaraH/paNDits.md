## Revenge of a Logician
Two friends grew up together in their gurukula, school. One studied astrology, another logic. They both became quite established in their fields. The logician (NaiyƒÅyika) wrote a good number of commentaries and introduced some new categories. The astrologer made tons of money. Tired of his poverty, the logician embarked to see his successful friend and ask for his help.

It is hard to imagine how quickly people change when they become successful. The astrologer could not stop making fun of the poor logician for the choice of his subject. And the villagers laughed at his cost. Heart-broken, the logician said farewell. When his friend tried to give him some money, he asked for just one single hair. The astrologer happily pulled one hair and gave it as a gift.

Confused, some villagers followed the logician and asked, why would you need a hair from the astrologer? The logician replied, oh! you poor villagers have no idea he is a Maha Siddha, a person with supernatural powers. A single hair from his body well kept in my house will make me a rich man.+++(5)+++

That was all it was needed for the villagers to gather and pull all the hairs from the body of the astrologer.

## Vivekananda
What I like the most about Vivekananda is that he made his spiritual quest a part of rational human inquiry.+++(5)+++ He did not pose himself as some supernatural being; he explored rational grounds for his beliefs and he trashed beliefs that he deemed irrational. He did not invoke his authority on the basis of his origins or his private experiences. While his teachings are grounded on Advaita, he did not use non-duality to market himself as God. It is his humanity that makes him great.


## Clown
a friend of mine rejected to submit his dissertation and instead decided to be an entertainer. he sang, played guitar, and sometimes became a clown and cherished children in their birthday parties. i wanted to see him before leaving town when i took my first big job. there i found him in a park, cheering up children with his painted face and funny sounds. he graciously hugged me and whispered, 'do not forget we are all in entertainment business!'

when Vardhamana walked out of Vaishali barefoot, he must have had the zeal to learn, to discover, and not to be entertained. when he stood up in deep meditation for years and years, i do not believe anybody cheered or clapped. may be he soaked all the desire in humanity to learn. all we want today is carnival. without Bakhtin, we would not even know what we really want.
