Ravana Dies Again

I remember asking my father after watching Ramlila twice: but they already killed Ravana last year and why did they kill him again? And my father said: you, son, have to kill Ravana again and again till the end of time. I simply failed to comprehend his statement and even forgot about this conversation. After five decades, I came to realize its depth and fathom meaning of repeated death of Ravana.

I do not know of the original Ravana. He could simply be an archetype. We may have always simulacra to burn. But it is the simulacra that is infused with life and that haunts us in our dreams and that shakes our reality. Like a shadow, Ravana catches us and drives us insane of power.

Demons are not all bad. For look at the advocates of Ravana today. They are mostly decent people. They just want those who do not like them or do not think like them or do not speak like them to be killed. They are otherwise completely rational. You can see Ravana screaming through the lynching mobs and masking themselves in the animal hides. These are not the masks to cover their identity but only to reveal the bestial within.

All Ravanas are stuffed effigies. They lack originality. All Ravanas are clowns as they lack authenticity. But all Ravanas pose an antithesis to humanity. Living human is about confronting our own negation, while alive, to see how our shadows are more alive than ourselves. If you think effigies are lifeless, you should talk to a Voodoo priest or an Tantric practitioner for that matter.+++(5)+++ Entities come to life the moment living beings impose life there. They animate when we want them to. And at times, our shadows confront us and force us to infuse life in the shadows, letting Ravana come back to life.

For every generation, they have this pious task to burn the effigy of Ravana. For Ravana dies again and again.

## Tulsi
Very little she knew that she was tricked. She had married a demon, a mighty one named Jalandhara. Her real name was Vrinda. One day Vishnu came when her husband was out fighting with Shiva. She could not resist the charms of Vishnu and she fell for him head on. For Vishnu, it was just another day in his cosmic play of maya. When he was leaving, she curses him, thy shall be reborn a rock, you heartless wretched one! Vishnu says smiling, you then will come to rescue me, born as Tulsi the plant.
