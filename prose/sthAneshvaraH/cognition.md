## Metacognition in animals
Do animals and birds have meta-cognition? We can all agree that animals and birds are conscious, are capable of cognizing, but how can you evaluate your own mental states and repeat the acts that you think are causal in producing the mental state of pleasure in absence of metacognition? Playing for fun is not uncommon among animals or birds. But these also demonstrate mimicry, particularly copying human actions. If they are able to copy human actions and are able to evaluate their mental states, are they also able to evaluate the mental states of the humans that they are copying? And if so, they are also inter-subjectively aware. For me, these are not problems, because the way I understand consciousness is it can never be bereft of reflexivity and inter-subjectivity.
