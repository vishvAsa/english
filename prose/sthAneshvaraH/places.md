## Ecological concern
ecological concern is not just an environmental concern; it also is not our concern for other species. at the end of the day, it is the search for our own lost soul. we are the only species capable of making a difference and saving species. nature has given us that power. it is about how we embrace our responsibility.

## Kali's Magic
I could not resist the temptation to climb up the little mound right next to the town. After the sunset, mountains wake up with their own music of silence and the blanket of darkness only makes them luminous nothing. It was just a hike of ten minutes and I wanted to capture this moment while my brother was still a company.

Twice those ten minutes passed by the time we reached what we thought was the summit only to realize that it was a path to Kali's temple. All we could see was the stairs, may be some twenty steps ahead. And we climbed. It led to another stairs and the next, and they kept coming. May be one thousand of them. In the dark, the sense of distance collapses. Either things appear very remote or intimate. For me, darkness makes things appear very close. And bonding.

Finally when we reached the summit, I was surprised to see a big temple under construction. It was at least a huge pile of concrete domesticating the nature. A couple were guarding the new construction and I was confused if they were the divine couple preparing their shrine. I asked the old man stupidly, "where is god?" and he retorted, they were kept in the station and will be installed upon completion of the shrine. I love it when gods are under a makeover. This is the only time gods are gods. As they are under the mercy of the working class, the god-makers, and the priests who will have to install life by breathing some mantras. This is the only moment that spirituality comes to life. And gets instantaneously taken over by commerce.+++(5)+++

While climbing down the hill, I pondered the magic of darkness. The sky was lit with the moon, although it must have been the fourth or the fifth day of the bright half. Now the darkness had overpowered the surrounding and it was not easy to distinguish a man with a stump. By the time we reached the settlement, I was feeling exhausted. It is not that the climb was long. May be just half an hour. But the darkness and our unpreparedness made it seem eternally long.

All of a sudden, I realized my feet were stuck on something soft. And someone from the side screamed, watch! They had poured concrete over the street and it was wet. It was not deep; just my shoes were stuck. And I heard some giggles. There were a bunch of ladies looking at our misery from their front-yard. I jokingly complained, what if I get stuck in the cement forever. One voice responded, then they would consider me a statue of Shiva and worship there forever. And all the ladies giggled. I could not see any faces as it was too dark. For the rest of the journey, I could just fantasize the faces to match the giggles.

Brahmdev and his wife were waiting for us, sitting on two sides of the door. By measuring their anxiety, it seemed they had given up on our safe return. The happiness in the faces of the old couple reminded me the mythical return of Krishna and the thrill of Yashoda.

Here we did it again. I mean getting lost. The same place, different time with different people.

## Kali's Magic II
Maula Kali is right across Devghat. People visit there from the other side, from the town. When you look up to the western hills from Devghat, you can see the shrine of Kali. It is right there to miss.

Three decades ago, I went there with friends. It was when the air still breathed the sacred and the place was holy. Covered with deep blanket of tropical green, hardly anybody visited to this shrine. There was no regular priest and the major shrine was a mast, an erected wooden poll, ergo Maula Kali. Colobine monkeys were impressed of my chants, and so were the forest birds. We could clearly see the Ashrams in Devghat from the top, and I said, friends, let us climb down through the forest. Let me tell you about myself. If I have friends, it means they follow the whim. I refrain myself from the company of thorough thinkers.

It did not take us even twenty minutes to get completely lost. I thought we could see the settlement as we climb down but the hills have their own ways. And we were lost there for five hours, in a hike that we could have finished in one. When things happen as planned, it becomes an event. But when things unfold as if alive and unpredictable, it turns into an adventure. Events have an end, are circumscribed, and are directional. Adventures, on the other hand, are rhizomatic. Every part is the beginning and an end to itself. I therefore like those who just go for a hike and not those who go for a hike somewhere. And every time I have gotten lost, I have found myself immensely close to myself.+++(5)+++

This time, I went to the shrine with my siblings. My sister works in her farm and makes a living so that her husband can be a great communist leader. My brother is enslaved by the Indologists who research on slavery.+++(5)+++ Again, we decided to climb down through the forest, and yet again, we got lost.

But there was a difference. The blows of time were visible everywhere. The first were the shops for religious objects so the pilgrims could offer something. When the sacred was still alive, people just climbed the mountain and encountered time in the body. And when it died at the hands of the merchants, people discovered faith, and they erected concrete pillars and cement buildings.

The first scene to encounter was the new shrines of some deities right at the foothill. As my sister went inside to make her offerings, I felt vertigo; It was nauseating, and I had to throw up. I thought it was the scene, as the shrines there were depressing. These may be some of the most disgusting temples I have seen in my life.+++(5)+++ My brother thought it must be something I ate. I wish I could be like my sister. Her sense of the sacred is not interspersed by the aesthetic. If you put a rock in a pile of trash, she would worship it just the same.+++(5)+++

They had stairs to climb up all the way. In Nepal, when they mean development, what they actually mean is concrete.+++(5)+++ These concrete stairs made it possible for the devotees to climb up, spend some money and feel redeemed. It also made it possible for the roadside shops to entice the pilgrims. Half the birds had abandoned the forest and the monkeys preferred human food.+++(5)+++

If you slice the body of god, the bottom half becomes faith and the top half becomes the business class.+++(5)+++ Ever since god asked Abraham to offer his only child, humans have wanted to offer the god to their child instead. Three decades ago, the mast was the shrine, with status making minimal entrance. They had dumped the wooden pole now and made a new symbolic cement mast. And they had a bunch of priests. The new temple with tons of cement stood in between the sacred and the profane. Money has a spiritual origins. It was made for the humankind to purchase god.+++(5)+++

Like the last time, we decided to avoid the road and climb directly down the hills. My sister was confident as she saw the newly made stairs, going directly to our destination.

As we rolled down, the stairs ended nowhere and the small trail forked in multiple places. Yet again, we were in the dense forest, clueless of our direction. I can fathom getting lost the last time but this time, it must be the power of Kali. As the forest is half shrunk, and there are cement stairs everywhere. Humans have expanded their footprints everywhere. And gods have pulled themselves out of the human ways.+++(5)+++

Now I was thirsty and hungry. The last I ate was a day ago and I forgot to carry water. I could have followed the stream but I was not actually dying of thirst to take the risk of dysentery. My sister managed to collect some parasitic plants, growing on top of bigger trees. They were actually good. And she also located a kavro tree with new buds. I climbed the tree and we had enough of lunch.

Last time it was my teacher but this time my father to scold me for being reckless. This is also another essential element. There has to be someone to reprimand you to make your acts adventurous. And when there is nobody left for that, you have to make other's actions adventurous.

Although the event was the same, there were different results. Last time I had thrill alive within, and this time, I only had the shadow from the past. I was only seeking the past to connect myself, as it is in these acts of walking down the memory lane that we rediscover ourselves, and sometime get a glimpse of self-recognition, binding past memories with new experiences. The highest form of self-realization is to encounter one's own stupidity.+++(5)+++ As our ignorance is something we adore more than anything else, keeping it preserved in the innermost compartment of the Russian doll. After all, Kali resides in the midst of darkness.

## West Nepal
Nostalgia.

It was around 1998 that I made my first trip to the western region of Nepal. Acham is a lovely place. Kalikot, of course. I was with brother Shanti Krishna for the trip to Dailekh. Long bus ride to Surkhet was nothing compared to the rest of the way. They had just started cutting the edge of the tall mountains to make a gravel road. The road was not finished but still then they were running bus service. When we were on top, the valley of Surkhet paralleled Amaravati. But the fun was marred by a quick jolt and by the time we were aware of the situation, the front right wheel of our bus was out of the road and the bus was tilting towards the slope. In seconds our next destination was going to be three thousand feet below.

Fortunately we managed to walk out of the bus. The driver stubbornly stayed in his seat, maneuvering the wheels. Two of his associates had some strong ropes and in no time, we all were pulling our bus. The workers heard the noise and a dozen helping hands appeared. In an hour or so, they fixed the slope, and the bus was eventually pulled out. I asked one worker, how good is the road ahead, and he said, it gets worse and worse.

We chose to walk. The locals were used to this and so they stayed in the bus. For, they had already paid for it, so why not to take a chance. This was also my first chance to see the origins of Timalsinas in the far west of Nepal.

## Damauli
The banks of Sveta and Madi once gave fertile land. Now covered with concrete, the small valley near Pokhara also endured the myths from the Mahabharata, particularly keeping Vyasa and Parasara alive. My hosts, a couple in their late seventies, seem to have survived for the last two millennia without any change. And change was dumped onto them, unwanted and unprepared.+++(5)+++ Brahmdev, I thought, will be swallowed up by time without waking up to the harshness in the underbelly of time.

Brahmdev was forced to move from his village; purchase small piece of land, and build a small house. I begged him to go with him to see his family house, few hours up in the mountains. He gave a helpless look.+++(5)+++ After the Maoist insurgency, some villages are practically captured by the so-called "lower castes." While the land is legally owned by the "oppressive" brahmins, the new forces inflicted pain in numerous ways, making their life miserable.+++(5)+++ Brahmdev does not know his fault of being born in a particular family. As all he did in his life was to teach the same villagers as a school teacher. His children either migrated abroad or settled in Kathmandu.

Trying to fathom the life of Brahmdev is like trying to understand the aftermath of the revolution. The same revolution that buried thousands in the dust, displaced millions, and of course, gave a couple thousand new millionaires.

My brother and I get restless. I ask Brahmdev for an easy way to climb the mountain to the east, and then to the west, and eventually anywhere. Brahmdev believes that nowhere is safe. "It is too risky," "it is not safe," he keeps completing each of my queries in negation. Of course I know things have been settled and there is not a real threat in those mountains. I am only fathoming the fear that this retired village teacher feels. The same villages that he gave education for the last forty years.+++(5)+++

We sneak out in the early morning, me and my brother. Find our own way and cross the Madi bridge. Ended up to a Shiva temple by the banks of Sveta. A caretaker responds, a bit embarrassed that their priest was ill and there was nobody to open the temple that day. I tell her, but I am a priest for today. A bit confused, she opens the gates. By the time I finished my meditation, my brother had almost finished taking selfies.+++(5)+++

While crossing the Sveta bridge, tears started rolling for no reason. I feel so nostalgic that I avoid going to Nepal at all costs. I was speechless seeing Dhayero and Dhursul blossom. When I was young, they bloomed everywhere.+++(5)+++ And some thirty years have passed since I last saw them bloom. I had never been to Nepal when they blossom. As a kid, I used to compete with bees to suckle from dhayero blooms and collect dhursul for the home shrine.

I am one among five million. The same five million that lives abroad, works hard and sends some money back home so that the politicians that have displaced people like Brahmdev can live a luxury life.+++(5)+++ There is meaning to my life, to make the life of the leaders in Nepal easy. I wonder what is the meaning of life for people like Brahmdev who did not hurt even one ant in their life and are waiting for the great time, Mahakala, surrounded by fear.

## Bhimbetka
In a corner of Bhopal not too far from Bhojpur lies Bhimbetka: A marvel that goes back to paleolithic and mesolithic times and the cave arts that date back to some 30,000 years. The art there is a fusion work of the neanderthals and the homo sapiens, literally a masterpiece of the marriage between some strange tribes. You can see the layers of early and later paintings; the folks kept using the same wall in different times. A closer analysis reveals what inspired the most the people of this changing era.

It is in these arts that we can see the humans first encountering itself. Not just "who am I?" but also "why me"? And this is where we see the humans discovering itself among other animals, surrounded by the animals, mostly the buffalo and deer, and of course, the elephants and tigers, and more.

The humans have discovered themselves in the battlefield. Just like Arjuna discovers his subjectivity in the midst of Kuruksetra, these early humans found their humanity in the midst of animals, devouring or being devoured. And above all, the most fearsome among the animals that the humans encountered were themselves.+++(5)+++ Making spears, learning to ride on animals particularly for the purpose of killing another human being, and waging wars seems the first symptomatic of the human, if Bhimbetka has something to tell us.

The early humans heard the echo from afar and carved their lives on the walls. These humans understood what they were and lived accordingly: both a subject and agent of death. They may have discovered God in the spilled blood of their brothers.+++(5)+++ The Neanderthal wife must have been overpowering, forcing the man to discover his masculinity by spilling blood of fellow humans. And animals. They must have made a marginal distinction between the humans and the other beasts. And thy must have recognized that some among the animals are not to be consumed. The Neanderthals did not build a wall; they instead lived together; and of course ate each other. And they left behind the legacy through the wall carvings that are for us to fathom. The man that the primitives discovered is as if hidden today but it is always there, wanting to come out of the caves, craving to be seen and be acknowledged.
