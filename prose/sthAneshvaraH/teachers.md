## Shorts
When there were teachers, I was not ready to listen.  When I opened my ears, they were gone.


## Teachers Never Die
Teachers Never Die. I used this exact copy of Bhuṣaṇasāra 35 years ago, when I studied with Bidur Paudyal. My friends evolved and did great many things in their lives. I, on the other hand, am stuck with the same old book, reminiscing the old times. Students are transitory. Teachers are transitory. All these relations are preconditions for the power beyond our being to express itself.

## The Light
My Guruji is no more. I lost both my fathers this year: the father who gave me this body and the father who raised me and taught me and trained me. I have no words, Ramji Malviya, of mine, which were not yours before I received them. My prayers and thoughts are merely the copies that you implanted in me. I will do my best to keep the torch alive, but without you behind, guiding me every step of the way, it is not going to be easy.

## Guruji
Every guru purnima, I have celebrated remembering my teachers. This is the first time I have felt that my teachers also remember me. It just so happened that I received a package in the day of guru purnima, and it was from Ramji Malviya, my teacher from Varanasi, who had sent me an akṣamālā, a rosary. I was his student in the 80s, and have not met him for the last thirty years. What a blessing to receive the beads in the day of guru purnima!+++(5)+++ Thank you guruji. And I have not forgotten the line that you made me  recite when we were together the last time: that I should not neglect my study and teaching (svādhyāyapravaca-nābhyāṃ na pramaditavyam).+++(5)+++
