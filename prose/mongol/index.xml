      <description>&lt;p&gt;When the Buddha was creating the animals,&lt;br&gt;&#xA;he forgot to give the bull and the camel their balls.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When the bull came to demand his balls&lt;br&gt;&#xA;the Buddha had to make some out of left over scraps,&lt;br&gt;&#xA;and gave him a pair of a sort.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;This is why they look as if they have been patched together.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Then the camel came to get his balls,&lt;br&gt;&#xA;and was offered some small left-over ones.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;He rejected them, saying: &amp;ldquo;These are much too small for a great big animal like me.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br&gt;&#xA;The Buddha got angry, saying: &amp;ldquo;Take them or leave them&amp;rdquo;&lt;br&gt;&#xA;and threw them at the camel from behind.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;The tiny balls stuck on him right at the back which is where the camel has them.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Once upon a time, the Mongols were giving the names of the animals to the twelve years of the calendar. They had allotted the names of eleven animals, and were won- dering what name to give to the very first year, when the camel and the rat began to quarrel as to whose name should be included. In order that neither of them should feel affronted, the TathƒÅgata appeared and told them to decide for themselves. The two animals made a wager that whichever of them should be the first to see the rays of the rising sun the next day should be put at the top of the twelve years. The camel stood waiting for the sun to rise, looking towards the east where it rises. The rat climbed on to the camel&amp;rsquo;s hump and looked westwards the whole time, gazing at the top of the mountain. Then, when the time came for the sun to rise and the sun&amp;rsquo;s first rays touched the top of the mountain in the west, the rat was the first to see the sunlight, and shouted out: &amp;lsquo;The sun has risen. The camel was cross at losing the wager, and rushed to trample the rat to death, but the rat ran under a heap of ashes and saved its life. From that time onwards, whenever it sees a place where ashes have been thrown out, the camel tramples and rolls on the ashes, trying to squash the rat his enemy. So the rat got included in the twelve years, and the camel was excluded. Although the camel did not get included in the twelve years, he is said to carry the features of all the twelve animals in his body. These features are:&lt;/p&gt;</description>
