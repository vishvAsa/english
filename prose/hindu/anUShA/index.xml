      <description>&lt;p&gt;Source: &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.deccanherald.com/opinion/drown-the-politics-please-not-our-young-people-3136062#google_vignette&#34;&gt;TW&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Drown the politics, please, not our young people&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You might know of Nachiketa as the brave boy who impressed Yama, the god of death, with his persistence in his pursuit of the truth. So here is the story of Ashtavakra, who, as a young man, impressed scores of scholars with his wisdom and his quest for justice.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The rapid closing down of multiple illegal coaching centres in the basements of New Delhi after students lost their lives in a flooding incident is too little, too late. That so many young people are unknowingly putting their lives at risk because of bad infrastructure in their hopes for a better future should make us sit up and take more notice. Who knows how many great Nachiketas or Ashtavakras we are losing daily to the banalities of corruption, inefficiency and indifference?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The fault, dear Brutus, is not…&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Sans the Sacred&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Anusha S Rao&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;With the election results now out, and all the politicians of competing formations scrambling to present a united front, it is time to think about how the exit polls were so wildly off-mark. All the political analysts are welcome to think about why the exit polls were misleading, and why the BJP’s campaign backfired &amp;ndash; after all, hindsight is 20-20. Among all this political punditry, there’s another kind of pundit having his say – the astrologer. There are a spate of articles examining the election results in light of Modi’s horoscope with a supposedly Scorpio ascendant. Someone even tried using I-Ching to make election predictions. But why resort to imported mumbo-jumbo when we have the home-grown variety that does the task nicely! So, here is a peek into the rich tradition of astrology and false predictions in Sanskrit literature.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>HaMsAvalI</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Source: &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.deccanherald.com/opinion/kate-wish-you-had-read-hamsavali-s-story-mate-2940106#google_vignette&#34;&gt;TW&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Kate, wish you had read Hamsavali’s story, mate&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Who will tell the British royals to carefully read the literature of the countries they once colonised?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Anusha S Rao&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;With Kate Middleton, the Princess of Wales, not having made a public appearance in a couple of months, everyone on social media is losing their mind, coming up with conspiracy theories as to where she might be and what she might be doing! As for me, of course it reminds me of a Sanskrit story that makes the secrets of the British royal family look tame in comparison &amp;ndash; it has intrigue, affairs, and mistaken identities, but also some black magic, and a satisfying ending. Without further ado then, here is the story of Hamsavali from the Kathasaritsagara.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>MahAbhArata fraud</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The ‘management lessons from Mahabharata’ fraud&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Why look at such a rich tradition of literature to extract banal lessons on how to squeeze a little extra from your corporate job? Let us read stories for what they are and they will enchant us anew.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;With all the news on the political front the same old, same old, perhaps you will allow me to indulge in a little tirade on one of my pet peeves &amp;ndash; courses on management techniques from the Bhagavad Gita. Or its more sophisticated counterpart, courses on applying Indian knowledge systems to contemporary law, engineering, and what-not. I was once at a discussion session with one of the greatest living experts on a particular Sanskrit philosophical discipline, and he was asked, “How do you think what we learn here can elevate the contemporary legal system?” And he replied simply, “It cannot”.+++(5 ??)+++&lt;/p&gt;</description>
