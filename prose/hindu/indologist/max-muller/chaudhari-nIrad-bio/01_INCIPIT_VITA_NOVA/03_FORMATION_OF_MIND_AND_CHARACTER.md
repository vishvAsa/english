FORMATION OF MIND AND CHARACTER 


When Max Muller ended his wander] ahre by taking up residence at Oxford, he was six months short of being twenty-five, and his personality, in its dual aspect of mind and character, was already formed in its structure and functioning After that, so far as his own development was concerned, he was to go on adding to the content of his mind But henceforth he was also to give his mind a new role — that of impinging on other minds as teacher and writer The publication of the first volume of his edition of the Rig-Veda in 1849 was symbolic of his transition from purely internal growth to external projection, which gained strength from year to year until m the last quarter of the nineteenth century he came to be accepted as one of the outstanding figures in the world of European thought At this point of transition it is necessary to take stock of his mind and character as these were then, and also to consider the influences which shaped them Perhaps the scope of this chapter will be more correctly stated if I say that in it I shall analyse young Muller’s personality as the product of a historical process What was dis- tinctively personal in his qualities and activities will come out of the whole account of his life What it is necessary to examine here is the relationship between his personality and the particular environ- ment, both social and psychological, in which he grew up This alone can place his individuality in its rightful historical setting The particularity of individual human-beings is geneially very much exaggerated, and in regarding every person as unique, as he in one sense certainly is, it is invariably forgotten that his particularity is only the psychological counterpart of what is known as continuous somatic variation in zoology, which makes every cat or dog equally particular It is only in the case of very exceptional persons that it is safe to attribute true individuality, and even then it cannot be assumed absolutely, for such men would also be found to be the products of a particular historical process Real originality is the surplus value which enables the exceptional man to give an added momentum to the process of which he is the product. 

The foundations of Max Muller’s mental life were laid in

Anhalt-Dessau, and under the control of the social and geographical environment which that principality constituted He made a symbolic confession about this himself He wrote in his autobiography, pub- lished after his death, that the Dessau dialect remained with him for life, and his friends told him that though he had spoken English and French for years they could always detect from his German accent that he came from Dessau or Leipzig One might add that there remained a dialectal or local accent in his thinking and feeling 

The first evidence of this is to be found in his religious beliefs All of pre-Reformation Christianity in the Protestant parts of Germany was remoulded by Lutheranism, which I might describe as the transforming of the deep, dark, warm and mysterious forest of German medieval Christianity into the good arable land of Protes- tantism Those who adopted this form of Christianity also thought that it was the most basic, simple and therefore indestructible form of the religion Luther himself was thought of by these Protestants as a saint His hymns were sung in churches, and seemed to singers and listeners alike to be little different from the psalms of David This musical expression of Lutheramsm reached its fullness in Bach Sharing the worship of Luther at Dessau, Muller was shocked when after coming to Oxford he found him spoken of as just another mortal, or even as a heretic, and a most dangerous one at that 

Max Muller came into his Protestant religious inheritance at Dessau through his mother, to whom he owed all the practical side of his religion He came to hold the view very strongly that any true religious feeling can only be planted deeply at home, and by a mother even more than a father Max Muller also believed that the sense of a divine presence everywhere, once implanted in the heart of a child, remains for life 

So it was with him His simple faith remained unshaken through all storms As he himself put it Tn its extreme simplicity and child- ishness it answered all the purposes for which religion is meant ’ It seemed to satisfy all his religious needs So what he read later in Strauss or Ewald, Renan or Colenso, never disturbed his faith or his life with and in God Nor was he interested in the question of the improbability of the Christian miracles, which for many of his con- temporaries had a crucial bearing on faith He wrote 

Suppose it was proved to me that, on geological evidence, the earth 

or the world could not have been created in six days, what was that to

me ? Suppose it was proved to me that Christ could never have given leave to the unclean spirits to enter into the swine [on the assumption that He could not be so unjust and unkind to innocent animals] what was that to me ? Let Colenso and Bishop Wilberforce, let Huxley and Gladstone fight about such matters , their turbulent waves could never disturb me, could never even reach me in my safe harbour 

So he remained outside the religious controversies of Oxford , and the crises of faith which formed an essential part of Oxford’s re- ligious life never touched him He could never share the doubts and agonies of his friends at Oxford — Froude, Liddon, Clough, Arnold or Kingsley — and he even tried to show them how self- made their difficulties were His own faith had little burden to carry, and no impedimenta bore it down 

This kind of faith made him take the duty of church attendance more or less lightly, and this attitude, he said, was typically German ‘The religious and devotional element,’ he wrote, £ is very strong in Germany, but the churches are mostly empty A German keeps his religion for weekdays rather than for Sunday ’ 

At a higher level his simple faith made him suspicious both of the Church and of theology This was stated by him most emphati- cally, not in any formal pronouncement on religion, but in his novel Deutsche Liebe ( German Love) Its hero, who certainly represented Muller’s own feelings, says 

The cause of many heated and violent conflicts lies in this, — that the doctrine of Christ, instead of winning our hearts gradually and irresis- tibly as it won the hearts of the Apostles and early Christians, meets us from our earliest childhood as the incontrovertible law of a mighty Church, and claims from us an unqualified submission, which we call faith Doubt will arise sooner or later in the breast of every one who has the power of reflection and veneration foi truth, and then whilst we are just in the right way to gam our faith, the spectres of doubt and unbelief rise before us, and hinder the quiet growth of the new life 

He always made a distinction between the Christ of faith and the Christ of the Church and formal theology He set forth the distinc- tion in a letter he wrote to his wife after she and his second daughter, Mary, had seen the Passion Play at Oberammergau in 1880. He wrote\* ‘It must have been very powerful — and I feel sure just now nothing is more wanted than to be powerfully impressed with the

truly human character of Christ It has almost vanished under the extravagant phraseology of hymns and creeds — and yet how much greater is the simple story of his unselfish life than all the super- latives of later theology 5 

The same opinion he repeated to Renan in another letter ‘My wife and daughter are still away, they were quite overpowered by the Passion Play at Oberammergau We have lost far too much of the reality of Christ, and I have always thought that your work has done most good by restoring that reality, so far as it can be, in dia- metrical opposition to Strauss 5 

This feeling had begun to grow on him very early in life, and he put it quite explicitly in the novel ‘It is only a wonder, 5 to quote its hero again, ‘that theologians have not yet deprived us of all religion, and they will do so if the believers do not determmately oppose them, and say to them, “Thus far, but no further 55 5 Though he knew that each church must have its ministers, he had also learned from history that ‘there has as yet been no religion in the world which the priests — the Brahmans, the Shamans, the Bonzes, the Lamas, the Pharisees and Scribes — have not corrupted and de- stroyed They quarrel and argue in a language which is incompre- hensible to nme-tenths of their community 5 

He quoted with approval the saying of an English writer that ‘truth makes revelation and not revelation truth 5 , and so if certain writings were required to be accepted by believers as the inspired truth and as the basis of the only saving religion, the question arose as to how anybody was to be sure that they weie inspired without imputing to himself an equal degree of inspiration ? They could avoid doing this only by admitting inspiration in the Apostles and early Fathers But that, too, was bound to raise the question of how was one to know which early bishops weie inspired and which were not In the end, the last desperate step was unavoidable, to accept apostolic succession by the laying on of hands as the channel of inspiration, making all inward conviction, all self-surrender, all faithful introspection superfluous 

His Lutheranism made Muller unsympathetic even to medieval German mysticism which gave expression to one of the most beauti- ful aspects of Christianity in Germany He could not share the current admiration for the Theologia Germanica , whose authorship was unknown So, in his novel, he made the hero say that according to his feeling it was wanting in the sense of the human and the real. 



FORMATION OF MIND AND CHARACTER 73 

‘The whole mysticism of the fourteenth century/ he said, ‘seems to me useful as a preparation, but it fiist attained its solution in that manly and courageous return to actual life which we find in Luther ’ Muller would have none of the ecstasy in annihilation which is the essence of Christian mysticism He accepted it as the first step ‘Man must, once in his life/ he said, ‘perceive nothingness, he must feel that of himself he is nothing, that his being, his beginning, his eternal life, are rooted and hid in something supra-terrestrial and incomprehensible 5 But that negative return to God could never lead to the goal, though it could create a divine longing after a true home The truth was that man could not abolish the act of creation, as the mystics desired Though formed from nothing, that is to say, by and of God alone, he could not through his own power return to nothing, and the self-annihilation of which the mystics spoke was hardly better than the Buddhistic Nirvana 

But this annihilation of the creature was not the will of the Creator, for He had created it ‘God makes Himself into man/ says St Augus- tine, ‘not man into God \* Mysticism should only be, as the ordeal by fire, to steel the human soul, not to dissolve it away into vapour like boiling water in a cauldron He who had perceived the nothingness of Self should also recognize this Self as a reflex of the truly divme Self 

But the invalid princess to whom the hero of Deutsche Ltehe says all this, replies ‘Health and strength are required for your faith, but there are also life-weary souls who long for rest and sleep, who feel themselves so lonely, that when they fall asleep in God they will miss the world as little as the world will miss them ’ 

That was the crux of the matter Max Muller’s faith belonged to a robust and active world in a particular age There was, however, m him a very strong mystical element or predisposition, but his religious conviction did not want to admit it So it passed over to his mode of thinking All his speculation, even though it concerned language, had a supra-rational streak in it, and he might be said to have been a mystic in philosophy, or for that matter in linguistics But this line of thinking and feeling about Christianity did not make Muller reject the historical approach to the religion In fact, there was no question of his rejecting that approach during the course of his education at school and university At school his religious teaching was chiefly historical and moral So from his earliest youth he was taught to look upon Christianity as an historical

fact, on Christ and his disciples as historical characters, on the Old and New Testament as real historical books 

At the university stage the historical study of Christianity became as familiar as the study of Roman history The professors he looked up to as great authorities, such as Lotze and Weisse at Leipzig and Schellmg and Michelet in Berlin, left him with a firm conviction that the Old and New Testaments were historical books which should be treated in accordance with the same critical principles as any other ancient books, including the sacred texts of the East He was taught to see that they contained only what, under the con- ditions in which they were written, they could contain, namely, a number of traditions of great antiquity collected by men who gathered together all that they thought would be useful for the education of the people As a result of this teaching, Muller left behind him the idea that the Christian scriptures contained revela- tion in the sense that they were verbally communicated by the Deity. What occupied his mind at that stage were questions as to the date and authorship of these books and the historical sequence of the doctrines embodied in them 

This shows that Muller was coming into the great movement of thought regarding Christianity which had been started at the end of the eighteenth century by Reimarus with his tentative attempt to distinguish between the historical Jesus and the theological Christ In this antithesis Max Muller did not go over to the historical school entirely In fact, after leaving university, he became some- what suspicious of it During his stay in Pans he frequently dis- cussed the historical aspect of Christianity with Renan, who was already adumbrating his idyllic view of Christ and his imaginative reconstruction of Judaism and Christianity By that time Muller had moved to the philosophical stage of his mental growth Under the influence of Kant, he was thinking more about the limits of knowledge, even in respect of the early history of Chnstianity, than of the specific problem of the date of, for instance, the fourth gospel Renan and Muller agreed that the evidence on the life of Jesus and on what he actually taught was very slender But while Renan still directed his attention to the historic aspect, Muller wanted to find out how the religious truths proclaimed by Christ could spring up m His mind at that time He doubted very much whether any scholai would be justified in giving his interpretation of the life and teaching of Christ from the historical fragments at his disposal Pie 



FORMATION OF MIND AND CHARACTER 75 

objected to Renan’s idyllic leanings, and when his Vie de Jesus was published in 1863, he called the image presented in that book, ‘Renan’s ghost, or rather his corpse of Christ’, which was very severe In the end Muller came to believe that each man had the right to believe in his own Christ, and to this view, he remained true, all through his life 

It was also from his Dessau upbringing that Max Muller derived the ethical counterpart of his religious principles — a simple and solid moral consciousness which developed robust convictions All through life nothing repelled him more than untruthfulness and deception, cowardice, idleness and self-mdulgence His sense of moral responsibility was very individualistic, due in part to the spirit of the age, but also to the fact that he grew up in a very small community In his autobiography Max Muller wrote that it was dangerous to go through life with so imperfect a knowledge of the world, and with so small a viaticum of wisdom None the less, all this stood him in better stead than a more sophisticated and complex view of life could have His early struggles were stark and bare, and they needed stark and bare qualities to be mastered Certainly, he could never have gone through what he had to endure and fight against without the aid of these elemental or even elementary pre- scriptions for tackling life As we have now seen, for practical pur- poses the only alternative to these moral precepts are sleeping tablets 

But even as a schoolboy Max Muller had begun to realize that however useful the moral rigidity of Dessau might be in practice, it could not be maintained in the sphere of moral concepts, for which a tenable view of moral evil was essential Curiously enough, this kind of introspection was set going within him by reading Goethe’s Wilhelm Meister in the last years of his school life He knew that his mother would not like his reading the book, and so he wrote. 

I had already said to myself that you would not be pleased that I had read Wilhelm Master, and in some respects you are quite right, not that it can exactly hurt me, but that it might occupy my thoughts too much On the evil influence of reading or other temptations, I could not point out any better passage than the Latin verse in Faust which Mephistopheles repeats to the student, that God is holy and good just because He knows what evil is This is very true if only further ex- plained, 1 e because He knows evil, He never commits it If we could

imagine that God did not know what sin and temptation are, we could 

not call Him God, for we should have an imperfect God So he assured his mother that the more dangerous things he read, the stronger he became to wage war against them He was, however, quite ready to admit his mother’s argument that it was foolhardy to throw oneself into temptations without thoroughly knowing oneself and ascertaimng how far one could stand firm This was a remark- able letter from a boy of some sixteen years 

Nevertheless, the moral rigidity of Dessau adhered to him in his dealings with other men, and it developed in him certain incapa- cities for living in the wider world into which he moved later He had to acquire the capacity to do so from painful experience At Dessau he saw those whom he liked, and those whom he did not, and there was no compulsion on him or anybody to cultivate un- pleasant fellow townsmen Therefore he did not become aware until very much later that in any community there might be a large intermediate group of people whom it was neither necessary to admire nor to despise, and with whom one could be civil without caring whether one met them again or not 

So, there giew up in his mind in his early years the image of a community divided into two classes, one quite perfect, pure as angels, and the other consisting of black sheep There were no inter- mediate links, no shading of light and dark As a result, he became used to approaching people with complete trust, and it took him many years before he learned to make allowance for human weak- ness He lost, as he admitted, many a charming friend because he weighed them in his rough Dessau balance At the end of his life he grew more tolerant, without losing his moral strictness He came to see that even disloyalty or untruth in certain circumstances might not be a deadly sin He realized that a man known to be guilty of falsehood to himself might yet be looked upon as perfectly honest and trustworthy by others He suspected also that moral severity could often be sharpened by self-mterest But this toler- ance did not come to him easily Nor did he have it when he came to Oxford at the age of twenty-five and most needed the capacity for making allowances 

On the other hand, the smallness of the human community in Dessau developed in him a very strong awareness of personal responsibility for social welfare To help others was a duty, and he considered that a tenth of his income should be the least that he 



FORMATION OF MIND AND CHARACTER 77 

gave away in charity In his days of prosperity he far exceeded this sum To his mother and sister he was most generous, and though he preferred the best cigars he gave up smoking altogether in order that his ‘charity purse’, as he called it, might not suffer 

There was another attitude which influenced his social and poli- tical outlook, perhaps due also to his growing up in the small prin- cipality of Dessau and having associations with the ducal family It was what might be called his special brand of royalism Max Muller came to know a large number of monarchs, from emperors to princes, and generally regarded them with respect and appreciation He also enjoyed his acquaintance with them, and when he wrote or spoke about them, he did so not only with a certain amount of admiration, but also with deference He was often criticized for this, and described as too courtly or even sycophantic 

But Max Muller’s attitude to princes had no touch of obsequious- ness in it Nothing reveals his own attitude so clearly as a passage m a private book of thoughts which he maintained over years after the death of his eldest daughter In this book, written in his own hand, I read under the date May 2, 1881, the following observa- tions in regard to Disraeli’s relations with Queen Victoria ‘Nothing is so dangerous in England than a Minister who bids for Court favours — nothing easier — nothing therefore more contemptible. The true friend of royalty would speak out at Court more even than in Parliament, and nothing keeps up my faith in Gladstone so much as his unpopularity at Court It is due to such men as Gladstone that monarchy in England has a future ’ 

There was no consciousness of inferiority in Max Muller’s atti- tude to royalty, far less any readiness to be a flatterer His royalism, if it can be described as such, was a projection of his own notion of and belief in aristocracy 

It has been my good fortune to see a good deal of royalty during the whole of my life [he wrote] I say good fortune on purpose, for, with all the drawbacks inherent in court life, royal persons enjoy some great advantages Their position is assured and well defined It requires no kmd of self-assertion, and wherever they appear, they have socially no equals, no rivals, and hardly any enviers They seldom have any in- ducement to try to appear different from what they are, or to disguise what they think and feel A king or a prince does not generally want to become anything else, and as they want nothing from anybody, they are not likely to scheme, to flatter, or to deceive.

Of course, he was aware that there were differences among the royalty as among the commonalty But he said that many bishops displayed their mitres and crosiers before other people’s faces much more than kings waved their crowns or sceptres Many people who become something, he added, forget that they were already some- thing, and seem to assume that they were created afresh when they were made peers, temporal or spiritual The princes, on the other hand, were to their business born, they did not become royal, but were born royal 

Muller’s mental growth had begun when he moved to Leipzig and to a larger world in which he met many musical celebrities A new stage in his intellectual development was marked by his joining the University of Leipzig in 1841 Though he had done very well at school he also became aware when he went to the university that his school education was entirely passive He was now to pass from intellectual tutelage to freedom in educating himself 

He was not eighteen when he joined the university, but at school he had received a thorough formal grounding in classical philology He could understand both Greek and Latin with ease , he could also speak Latin easily, and follow the lectures of his professors when they delivered them in Latin But he could not resist the lure of unknown subjects, and spread himself over many of them even at the risk of attempting too much 

German students were required to keep what was called a Collegienbuch , in which the professors attested what lectures the student attended Muller preserved his book to the end of his life It contains an impressive list of subjects German literatuie, aes- thetics, anthropology, harmonic composition, Hebrew grammar, psychology, German grammar, medieval German literature, Hegel, modern history, Sanskrit grammar Sanskrit literature, Arabic grammar, the history of Onental literature In his second year the emphasis transferred to philosophy, and philosophy and Sanskrit were combined with history, both ancient and modern In his last term he began the study of both Persian and the Veda 

Finally, however, he had to decide what he would concentrate on. He found little to rouse his enthusiasm for Greek and Latin Eveiy- thmg seemed to him to have been done, there was no virgin soil left to plough, and as he significantly added, ‘no rums on which to try one’s own spade’, which showed that his mind was feeling the attraction of what might be described as^the archaeology of ideas. 



FORMATION OF MIND AND CHARACTER 79 

His work in Greek and Latin had been on established scholarly lines He respected his teachers in classical scholarship Fie saw that they taught the principles of criticism, both external and inter- nal, very thoroughly, and made the student realize what accuracy meant Rut he regretted that he had failed to acquire a larger know- ledge of Greek and Latin literature, and of the character and spirit of each author He wanted to break out of this closed world into the open air of a wider mental world So he betook himself to philosophy 

This was perfectly intelligible, for his natural interest was in ideas, and in language as the vehicle of ideas At that time, although Hegel had been dead for more than ten years, Hegelian fever still ran high To be a Hegelian was considered a sine qua non not only among philosophers, but also among theologians, men of science, lawyers, artists and everybody else who pretended to have any kind of mental life If Christianity in its Protestant form was the State religion of Prussia, Hegelianism was its State philosophy To be a Hegelian was supposed to be a help to advancement in life All the young spirits at Leipzig had heard of Hegel’s Idea, and looked to the dialectic process as the solution of all difficulties 

There followed a strong reaction, and even in Berlin Hegel’s standing suddenly collapsed After that no truly scientific man liked to be called a Hegelian 

Max Muller made a sincere and determined attempt to under- stand Hegel’s philosophy, especially the concept of the Idea and the dialectic method, and he had a very sound teacher, Professor Weisse, a Hegelian, but a sober one and as much a critic as he was an admirer. Weisse was convinced of the truth of the dialectic method, but differed from Hegel in its application From his study of history and philology Max Muller felt, like Weisse, that there was a contra- diction between the theories of Hegel and facts He was confirmed in this opinion by the teaching of a young professor at Leipzig, Lotze, whose Metaphysics he later got published by the Clarendon Press at Oxford 

The teaching of another professor, Drobisch, also served Muller as an antidote to Hegel Drobisch taught Herbart’s philosophy, whose chief object was to analyse and clear up concepts As Muller was occupied with the problem of language he was stimulated by the philosophy of Herbart to seek accurate definition of words But the kind of thinking which finally turned Muller away from Hegel

was historical In developing a historical attitude to the growth of human thought, Max Muller was influenced and guided by another professor, Dr Niedner, whose manual for the history of philosophy he found useful all through life In contrast with Weisse and Drobisch, the teaching of Niedner was wholly historical This appealed to Muller, and as he said, his own philosophical interest became strong and healthy only after he had heard the lectuies of Niedner 

Meanwhile, his special philological interest had also taken a turn which was to lead him to a study of the early history of languages and of thought The immediate impulse came from his desire to take up some language which others did not know, and he tried three Oriental languages Finally he chose Sanskrit as his own special field, prompted by an inner urge which came from an early experience, combined with a very important aspect of the spirit of the age the rising interest in India 

When he was a small boy at Dessau, one of his copybooks had a large picture of Benares on the outside It was a very rough picture, but he could still see the figures of men, women and children as they stepped down the ghats to bathe in the waters of the Ganges As everyone who has seen that view knows, it is one of the most moving and impressive to be seen in all India The picture caught Muller’s fancy He had already heard about India, but knew nothing more than that the people were black, that they burnt their widows, and that to go to heaven they had first to be mangled under the wheels of the car of Juggernaut At Leipzig University a remem- bered vision of childhood was reawakened when he heard that a chair had recently been established for Sanskrit Afterwaids he also saw lectures advertised by Professor Brockhaus 

He had heard also about Hindu philosophy, though very vaguely Afterwards he had read Schlegel’s Uber die Sprache und Weishett der Indier published in 1808, and Wmdischmann’s Die Philosophte in Fortgange der Weltgeschichte (1827-34), both pioneering books which had ushered in new ideas, and left on many minds, as they did on Muller’s, a feeling that new fields were waiting to be prospected which would yield gold if only there were the people to dig This 

general inclination took a practical form when Muller heard of the , c\* 1( j nt

FORMATION OF MIND AND CHARACTER 81 

prejudice in scholarly circles against Sanskrit, especially among the classical scholars The number of men who stood up for it were still very small, though they were all eminent, e g , Wilhelm von Hum- boldt, and the two Schlegels 

But Brockhaus was established at Leipzig, and Muller called on him, and got himself enrolled There were only two other students to attend the lectures, both very much his semor One was Spiegel who became a Professor of Sanskrit as well as Zend, and Klengel, a scholar, philosopher and musician, who gave up Sanskrit after a term or two He encouraged Muller, however, and told him that something might be made of Sanskrit by a philologist and a philo- sopher So, under Brockhaus, he began with simple grammar and went as far as the Rig-Veda 

With the choice of Sanskrit as his mam scholarly pursuit, Muller’s vocation, and with it his profession, became, so to speak, predeter- mined But even in Sanskrit his interest was not to be purely linguistic In the university, it has been seen, his dislike for formal classical philology was strengthened On the other hand, his inclin- ation for philosophy grew, and for a time he thought of becoming a philosopher Thus, dreaming of a chair of philosophy in a German university, he began to feel that he must know something which other philosophers did not know, and having heard of Oriental philosophy he was led to learn Oriental languages, and finally settled down to Sanskrit 

This wider background to his philological studies must never be overlooked, and from the very first he thought of his knowledge of Sanskrit as a key to another mental world By the time he came to Oxford to deliver his address before the British Association, this view of philology was fully developed in his mind Technically, his paper was on the linguistic affiliation of Bengali, whether it belonged to the Indo-European family or not But while trying to establish that it did, he was fully aware of the immensely wider background of the question So he said 

What does it matter whether Bengali belongs, by its grammatical structure, to the Indo-Germamc or the Turkish family of languages, provided that a man knows enough of it to express what he wishes ? My answer is this from comparing languages, from finding out ana- logies between them, from tracing the origin of forms in modern languages down to the living roots of more ancient languages, and from going back, as far as it is allowed to us, to see the first mamfestation of

the human mind by human speech, we derive, I think, a threefold advantage — an historical, practical, and philosophical 

According to him the historical gam was this 

When poetical tradition is silent, when historical recoids are lost, when physiological researches fail, language will speak and decide whether there has been a community and connection in the intellectual develop- ment of different people 

The philosophical vista opened out was even vaster 

Language stands in the system of the intellectual world as light stands m the system of the physical world, comprising all, penetrating all, and revealing all There is more indeed to be read in human language itself than in anything that has been written in it 

Thus he thought that a scientific study of language would help to reveal the prehistory of the human mind, and disclose the mental affinities of different human groups Actually, in this paper written before Muller was twenty-four, the whole sweep of his scholarly career is already foreshadowed 

By that time he had not only arrived at a definite idea of his scholarly interest, but also of the kind of life he wanted to live It could only be a life devoted to thought and contemplation Even at school his ideal was that of a monk, undisturbed in his monastery, surrounded by his books and a few friends But as there were no Protestant monks among whom he could become a Protestant Benedictine, he thought he would become an assistant in a large library. From a very early period of his life he became conscious of the narrow horizon of human life on earth, and the purely pheno- menal character of the world in which he assumed he was to move, live and have his being for only a few years 

Such a view of life neither did nor could exclude music, not only as an accepted element but also as a theoretically justified element, for Muller came in the end to hold a supra-rational view of music It remained an enjoyment to him, and more than that, a spiritual experience He grew into the belief that music was, of all the arts, the least worldly, that it was not of this earth at all He saw that music was not an art of imitation and that it did not reproduce, im- prove or sublimize (as he put it) anything that we could hear with 



FORMATION OF MIND AND CHARACTER 83 

our ears in the external world, not even the song of a lark So he declared that neither history nor evolution could help anybody to account for Schubert’s Trockne Blumen , and he added that Schu- bert’s melodies were picked up, not in the Prater, but in another world In simple words, Muller thought that music was an absolute art, even in its vocal form 

He began with Haydn, Mozart and Beethoven, lived on Men- delssohn, rose to Schumann, and reached even Brahms But he never learned to enjoy Wagner, except, as he qualified his statement, m his lucid moments He confessed his failure with Wagner in these words T have tried in vain to find out what prominent music con- noisseurs admire in Wagner I have shunned neither time nor trouble, but without results, the swamp in which we find a few lilies is too deep for me ’ 

At all events, he admitted that enjoyment of music was very much a matter of habit He himself was most happy in the early morning of romantic music in Beethoven and Schubert In his enjoyment of execution too Max Muller remained attached to the early nineteenth century He shied at the virtuosity which was ushered in by Liszt, and sighed for an allegro or andante by Haydn or Mozart played as they were in his young days with simplicity on very imperfect in- struments As he grew older and had to hear more and more tech- nically faultless playing he thought that these performers thought more of themselves than of the musician-poets whom they were rendering He recalled that with all their technical skill even Mendelssohn and Clara Wieck (Schumann) acted only as faithful interpreters Therefore even when he listened to the exquisite performances of these latterday virtuosi, he himself thought more of what they were playing than of how they were playing 

When Max Muller settled at Oxford at the age of twenty-four, music was still an active pursuit for him, but in the next five years he found that he had to be economical of his time and he gave up many things which were a pleasure to him So in November 1854 he wrote to his mother about his musical interest\* 

One’s delight in music always lasts, and I owe the old instrument so much — not only the enjoyment one has had, and the use my music has been as an introduction in a foreign place, but also the happy frame of mind which music unconsciously produces in one, and it smooths many little roughnesses which one often sees in those who have no taste for music People who cannot smg are almost as badly off as people

So far the mental development of Max Muller has been traced as it proceeded from his own internal impulses, but these very im- pulses were also the products of the spirit of the age, and in their expression were wholly controlled by the same spirit Therefore it is now necessary to examine the movement of the human mind, the European mind, in the age in which Muller grew up The most important movement was the Romantic Movement, and it may be stated as a brief enunciation of the formation of Max Muller’s mind that he was a child of that movement ' I do not think there is, even now, a full realization of the sweep, depth and significance of the Romantic Movement, and of its revo- lutionary impact on the European mind Actually, it was a new force in the evolution of European civilization I regard it as the last Renaissance of Europe, as the final phase of the development of the European mmd in the long historical process that began with the fall of the Roman Empire It was certainly not less important than the Renaissance, and its impact on the human spirit rather than on human activity, was more creative than that of the French Revo- lution 

It stimulated every aspect and kind of mental activity, passional, ratiocmative, scholarly, imaginative and artistic, and gave to each a special motivation, method and expression Under its influence people loved and worshipped differently, studied and taught dif- ferently, wrote books and composed music differently, and all these departures from the established pattern were made possible be- cause, in the first instance, it created a different type of European mmd which would not stay within the limits set by the eighteenth century To the Romantics the eighteenth-century attitude, the classical attitude, the rational attitude, the whole extrovert thinking, feeling and moralizing of the Aufklarung seemed to make a man an object with surface and no depth So the Romantics deprecated rationalism and extolled intuition, thought little of sense but much of sensibility And in their groping and unsystematic way, they even dived down mto the subconscious long before Freud Any sudden or fresh intensification of feeling and thinking within an individual makes him first of all aware of himself as the most vivid reality and, realizing the truth of the philosophical dictum

cogito, ergo sum in his throbbing being, he also becomes egoistical, and at times even goes over to an egregious puppyism The Roman- tic Movement glorified the self above everything else, and naturally it arrived at the conviction of the autonomy and irrepeatability of the individual From this it was only one step to the feeling that the most valuable thing foi an individual was experience in itself, rather than the fruit of experience A book like Senancourt’s Ober- man would not have been possible without a new attitude towards introspective brooding, even to the point of enjoying nothingness, vide et neant 

The trend continued in Amiel, whose Journal Muller enjoyed very much when it was sent to him by a friend, to whom he wrote in reply ‘A delightful book — how little we know of the untold wealth of the world ! In the eyes of the world, who is Amiel ? and is he not ten times richer than Lord Over stone ^ 

I am inclined to think of Walter Pater as fighting the battle of Romanticism belatedly at Oxford, and I am surprised neither by his quoting Novalis when the latter says, ‘Philosophiren, ist dephlegma - tisiren, vivifiaren’ (To philosophize is to dephlegmatize and vivify), nor at his being accused of Cyrenaicism or an unmanly hedonism by the Oxford of his times It is the Romantic credo that we read m the beautiful conclusion to his Studies in the History of the Renaissance . 

To burn always with this hard gem-like flame, to maintain this ecstasy, is success in life Failure is to form habits, for habit is relative to a stereotyped world, meantime it is only the roughness of the eye that makes any two persons, things, situations, seem alike With this sense of the splendour of our experience and of its awful brevity, gathering all we are into one desperate effort to see and touch, we shall hardly have time to make theories about the things we see and touch 

If the Romantic Movement enlarged the mind internally by diving or dredging deeper within it, externally the widening was brought about by sending it wandering into space and time The Romantics broke out of the mental baroque palaces and formal gardens of the eighteenth century to move into all nature, even the wildest They heard the call of the far-off In the same way they wanted to go far back in time They could not accept the restricted, over-rationalized, abstract and didactic views of man and of human affairs current in the eighteenth century, and by exploring both

space and time they wanted to discover both the Total Man as the product of a flux and the Urmensch as its startmg-pomt 

Basically, the Romantic Movement everywhere was a reassertion of the Germanic element in European civilization after its relative suppression in the Age of Enlightenment Therefore the German Romantic Movement is the Romantic Movement, just as the Italian Renaissance is the Renaissance But it was not only a reassertion of the Germanic element, it was also the most powerful and widest assertion of that element which gave the whole of European culture of the nineteenth century its particular expression The post- Napoleonic era was the epoch of the ideological hegemony of Ger- many in Europe This was in complete contrast to the political eclipse and even military decline of Germany in that age For the Germans themselves German politics up to 1848 was an arena of futility and disappointment, and to the rest of Europe it was a spec- tacle of pitiful ineptitude Even in the military sphere the prestige of Prussia created by Frederick the Great was wiped out by Jena In fact, the regeneration of the Prussian army begun by Scharn- horst did not become evident to the world till after 1866 and 1870 But in the mental sphere the post-Napoleomc era was a penod of the self-assertion of the Germans in Europe ‘What a change,’ noted Treitschke, ‘from the days of Louis XIV when our nation had been forced to go humbly to school to all other nations of the West ’ 

Neither Treitschke’s German nationalism nor his unqualified championship of Prussia makes his summing-up of the spirit of the Romantic Movement and of its influence in Europe anything but an objective statement of historical facts, and it is as such that I quote the passage 

For the first time since the days of Martin Luther, the ideas of Ger- many once more made the round of the world, and now found a more willing acceptance than of old had the ideas of the Reformation Germany alone had already got completely beyond the view of the world order characteristic of the eighteenth century The sensualism of the days of Enlightenment had been long replaced by an idealist philosophy, the dominion of reason by a profound religious sentiment; cosmopolitanism by a delight in national peculiarity, natural rights by a recognition of the living growth of the nations, the rules of correct art by free poesy, bubbling up as by the natural energy from the depths of the soul, the preponderance of the exact sciences by a new historico-

aesthetic culture By the work of three generations, those of the classical and of the Romantic poets, this world of new ideas had slowly attained to maturity, whereas among the neighbouring nations it had hitherto secured no more than isolated disciples, and only now at length made its way victoriously through all the lands 


Such was the influence of this Germanic Renaissance that by the end of the nineteenth century it became impossible, as it still is today, to take any view even of the two most important non- Germanic elements in European civilization, the Graeco-Roman and the Christian, without taking account of the information and inter- pretation piovided by the Germans The foundations of modern classical and biblical scholarship were relaid by the intellectual effort set in motion by the Romantic Movement Curiously enough, even the art of war as practised by the supreme Latin, Napoleon, became Geimamzed through the writings of Clausewitz Max Muller’s own contributions to linguistics, mythology and religion were an extension of the German influence in these special spheres, as they were also the products of the Romantic Movement 
- The aspect of the Romantic Movement which is particularly 
relevant to Max Muller’s mental formation is its impact on intel- lectual activities in Europe, and, more especially, the result of the impact in three directions the creation of the historical attitude and the historiography of the nineteenth century, which made it the century for history, the appearance of a new motivation and spirit in scholarly pursuits, and, as an offshoot of these two, the exhibition of a deep and enthusiastic interest in the East and especi- ally India Of these, the third product will be dealt with in a later chapter Here I shall briefly consider the other two 

The relation between the Romantic Movement and the historical output of the nineteenth century will be found set out and explained m every book on the history of historiography in that century, but what I would stress here is the fact that the historical attitude itself was a contribution of the Romantic Movement to the writing of history Before that, history was of course written, but not in an historical spirit To give only one example, that most outstanding historical work of the eighteenth century, Gibbon’s Decline and Fall was a moral commentary in the spirit of eighteenth-century rationa- lism and on the events of an epoch of the past Its spirit was didactic and not historical. The conception of history as a process through

which humanity has reached its present state, and which is con- tinuously carrying it forward, came after the Romantic spirit and was created by it It was not only post hoc , but also propter hoc 

Nothing could be more natural A new interest in history was bound to be created by the Romantic’s yearning and respect for the past as a refuge from an unsatisfying present, and by his sheer enjoyment of the Middle Ages and other periods of the past as emotional experience The claims of the past as consciously asserted by the Romantic writers did not proceed from any arriere-pensee , but were accepted as self-justified But this interest had also behind it a revolutionary philosophical assumption regarding the nature of human phenomena of all kinds, the assumption being that these were organic, that is to say, things which were always growing, and were not finite wholes created at a particular point of time for all time This was bound to lead men to the past as the source of the present, and to write history to explain its character The apocalyp- tic attitude of the Romantics also helped history, for that attitude is only the historical attitude projected forward into the future But if any apocalyptic vision is to be convincing, the eschatology it formu- lates has to be a logical extension of past history with intuitional additions In fact, the apocalyptic attitude and the historical are closely connected in the psychology of a people, as was shown by the Jews 

The impact of the Romantic Movement on the spirit of scholar- ship was equally decisive and fruitful, especially in Germany There the Reformation virtually destroyed humanism, and for more than a century the religious wars hardly allowed the spirit of scholarship to keep itself alive Thus even the history of classical scholarship in the seventeenth century, the great century of scholar- ship, was virtually a blank page in Germany It was not till Leibnitz re-created it that the spirit of scholarly inquiry became general again m that country, and it was not till Gesner began to write and teach that a new humanism appeared there 

By that time, however, European scholarship had become as elaborate and as artistic an expression of the human mind as baroque architecture It had become a complex ciaft in the hands of Scaliger and Casaubon, and had been given a new technique by Mabillon, and also a new solidity by him and Tillemont, whose ‘inimitable accuracy’, as Gibbon put it, ‘almost assumes the character of Genius’ But all this stupendous and meticulous scholarship, most

impressively represented in England by Bentley and Porson, was concentrated on books and not on life The monastic scholars did indeed go beyond books, but their interest was to illustrate and justify a static Church and its doctrines Basically, the object of both the secular and clerical scholarship of the pre-Romantic Age was collection of information, supplemented by exegesis In its elegance and economy, in its sheer virtuosity, this scholarship was like the superb singing of the castrato Farmelli — but it did not help men to live, nor was it fecund in renovating the will to live For that a different kind of scholarship was needed, which would be a voyage of discovery in space and time, and would discover ideas and facts to give a new meamng to life and lead to happiness This impulse of scholarship to transform itself came from the Romantic Movement 

In all the ramifications of his scholarly interests and researches, and even more in the special field of language, religion, mythology, including Indian religion and philosophy, Max Muller remained within the framework of scholarship created by the Romantic Move- ment He was historical as well as practical In fact, he became so historical that in the end the prehistory of the human mind became a greater preoccupation with him than history Almost at the end of his life, in a preface to the collected edition of his works (which began to be published early in 1898), he re-affirmed that the historical principle had been the essence of his method in all his inquiries 

During the last fifty years [as he wrote] I have never lost sight of the pole-star that guided my course from the first I wanted to show that, with the new materials placed at our disposal durmg the present cen- tury it has become possible to discover what may be called his- torical evolution, in the earliest history of mankind At the present moment it may truly be said that what is meant by evolution, or con- tinuous development, has now been proved to exist in the historical growth of the human mind quite as clearly as in any of the realms of objective nature Language, mythology, religion, nay, even philo- sophy can now be proved to be the outcome of a natural growth, or development, rather than of intentional efforts, or of individual genius 

In the previous year he had said the same thing in an interview given to a religious magazine ‘My interest in all religions is chiefly historical, I want to see what has been, in order to understand what is ’ Nothing could be more unambiguous

It was, again, his sense of historical continuity which made him justify his project of translating Kant’s Critique of Pure Reason , which many of his friends disapproved of as wasting time on a mere translation, by setting down in the preface his feeling of a connexion between this book and the Rig-Veda 

The two friends, the Rig-Veda , and Kant’s Critique of Pure Reason , may seem very different, and yet my life would have been incomplete without the one, as without the other The bridge of thoughts and sighs that spans the whole history of the Aryan world has its first arch m the Vedas, its last in Kant’s Critique While in the Veda we may study the childhood, we may study in Kant’s Critique of Pure Reason the perfect manhood of the Aryan mind 

On the other hand, the conviction that there must be a human motive even behind the most out-of-the-way inquiry into the past was also asserted by him in connexion with his edition of the Rig- Veda As early as 1864 he wrote to his wife -

I feel convinced, though I shall not live to see, that this edition of mine and the translation of the Veda will hereafter tell to a great extent on the fate of India and on the growth of millions of souls in that country It is the root of their religion, and to show what that root is, is, I feel sure, the only way of uprooting all that has sprung from it during the last 3,000 years 

It was this human approach to learning which made a parochial clergyman’s wife in America write to Max Muller’s wife after his death 

I feel almost as if I could burn incense daily to the memory of Pro- fessor Max Mullerl To me he lives, and of late in all my spare time I am reading his books, and learning what it is to think of the greatness of the love of the Eternal One , and more than any of the devotional books I have read, Max Muller’s teachings help me to understand what religion means You know that in the rush and whirl of what is called Church life, one does not reach the highest. In my own little room, with Professor Max Muller I spend all my leisure moments It is not his memory, but he himself, who in his strong, brave, beautiful life of searching for Truth, now helps me 

No scholar would have been read in this spirit if he had based his vocation only on the intellect Something beside and beyond that

was necessary, indeed by the time he settled at Oxford his intellec- tual quest had become part of his life of faith This is revealed in a letter written in Oxford on his twenty-fifth birthday by Muller to Bunsen 

Twenty-five years of this life he behind me today, and one feels in- voluntarily in a more earnest and solemn frame of mind at such a moment I look back with gratitude on the first half of my life, which, notwithstanding many sad moments, leaves me with the memory of a happy youth, and what at the same time, after many struggles, has given me a firm faith in a Divine Providence, trust in mankind and peace in myself, and cheerful courage to begin the second half of my life
