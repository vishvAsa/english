To Max Muller the Rig-Veda , which kept him occupied fully or partly for thirty years, was only a means to an end Not that he ever underrated the value of the means, absolute or relative, on the contrary, he emphasized its importance so much that people might justifiably have thought of him as a man who was riding a hobbyhorse Conscious of this, he again and again made out a case for studying the Rig-Veda Nevertheless, the establishment of its text and that of Sayana’s commentary, followed by an attempt to understand its meaning, was to him the preliminary investigation in a wider quest — the examination, in a particular field, of phenomena he was primarily interested in and wanted to understand In short, his work on the Rtg-Veda could be compared to the experiments carried out by a theoretical physicist or, better still, to the investigations of Darwin 

The cast of his mind was speculative, philosophical, or even metaphysical, and its natural inclination was towards generalization This grew stronger in him as he became older, and towards the end of his life he gave expression to his respect for generalization by quoting a sentence of Emerson and providing his own gloss on it 

Let us take such a sentence as ‘Generalization is always a new influx of divinity mto the mind — hence the thrill that attends’ To the ordinary reader such a sentence can convey very little , it might seem, in fact, a mere exaggeration But to those who know the long history of thought connected with the question of the ongm of conceptual thought as the result of ceaseless generalizations, Emerson’s words convey the outcome of profound thought They show that he had recognized in general ideas, which are to us merely the result of a never-ceasing synthesis, the origmal thoughts or logoi underlying the immense variety of created things, that he had traced them back to their only possible source, the Divme Mind, and that he saw how the human mind, by rising from particulars to the general, was in reality only approaching the source of those divme thoughts, and thus becommg conscious, as it were, of the influx of divinity

As was natural, this bent found its concentrated application in his basic intellectual interest — human thought, its origin and development Actually, as it progressed, his intellectual activity became more and more concerned with what I have called the prehistory of the human mind, on which he showed himself to be a pioneer This was pointed out in a French book, UOngin de la Pensee et de la Parole , published from Pans in 1900, a few months before his death and recommended by him in his autobiography ‘as giving a clear and complete abstract of my writings’ \* 

The name of the author was given as in Moncalm, but it was the pseudonym for a woman, Madame de Wagner, who lived in Rome She wrote to him in 1895 asking permission to quote from his works in a book which she said was being written by a friend Leave was granted, and when passing through Rome in 1897 he met the lady, he found that she herself was the author When the book was sent to him after publication Muller was recovering from his severe illness of the previous year, and he could only write ‘Many thanks for your present Today I can only say, Brava f Brava f But I hope to say something more as soon as I can shake off my weakness ’ But he could not 

In the introduction Madame de Wagner said that till recently those who were interested in the origins of life or of man could hardly get beyond the account in the Bible, or imagine that there were documents to illustrate the unexplored regions of the physical and mental world which were much more ancient But, she went on 

Two enterprising men, Darwin and Max Muller, visited and studied them Darwin sought to explain what the origin of organic beings might have been, and in what way they passed through a series of evolutions, from one form to another of great dissimilarity The development of human reason has been one of the objects of Max Muller’s researches This great thinker, who is at the same time the first philologist of our time, has sought in the Science of Language for the origin of thinking man 

Here the whole connexion between Max Muller’s basic intellectual propensity and his philological work was indicated If his end was to understand the beginnings of mental activity in man, whose first notional products were about religion and! mythology, he had to

understand the emergence and employment of language at the very outset So his philological inquiries would have been another means to an end for him But, in actual fact, it was much more than that — a merging of his interest in thought as well as in language This was due to a theory of his which held that thought and language were inseparable and co-existent To use a theological phrase there was a consubstantiality between the two Ratio et Oratio , he said, were one, and he referred to the fact that the Greeks designated both by the same word, Logos Therefore, one is not surprised to find Muller saying ‘Language is the autobiography of the human mind \* 

Max Muller’s conclusions about language will be summarized later in this chapter, but before this is done it is necessary to describe his work on language in general I have already mentioned that his first public utterance was on a problem of language, when he appeared before the British Association for the Advancement of Science at its meeting at Oxford in 1847, and that foreshadowed his matured ideas about philology His next contribution was an article m the October 1851 issue of the Edinburgh Review It was nominally a review of the English translation by Lieutenant Eastwick of Franz Bopp’s Comparative Grammar , but it was also an essay summing up the results achieved to date by the new science of Comparative Philology Muller concluded the article with the words Tt may be seen from this single instance that Comparative Grammar addresses itself not only to the Grammarian, but to the Philosopher and the Historian also \* He never forgot this comprehensive ambiance of philology in his treatment of language 

It was, however, as deputy and full Taylonan Professor of Modern European Languages that Max Muller developed his linguistic ideas over a number of years This professorship was intended not only to advance the study of the languages and their contents, but also to deal with them in the light of the new science of Comparative Philology Speaking as Tnthen’s substitute, he devoted his first lecture to the history and origins of modem European languages His second lecture was on the Niebelunghed f and the third on the origins of the Romance languages These lectures foreshadowed the ideas which he finally embodied in two courses of lectures delivered in 1861 and 1863 on the science of language 

These roused not mere interest, but enthusiasm After reading the 1861 lectures when they were published in book form, Dean

Liddell wrote to Muller on November 16 , x 86 i Tt is humiliating to learn that the lectures have been delivered to the heedless ears of Oxford hearers 5 He was unfair to Max Muller’s audience, for the hearers, so far from being heedless, remembered their thrill even as old men Cowell, who went to Calcutta as principal of the Sanskrit College and afterwards became Professor of Sanskrit at Cambridge, was then an undergraduate He wrote: ‘The lecture was a written one, and was delivered to a large and attentive audience, and to most of those present, as well as myself, it was an introduction to the new world of Comparative Philology It was the first of a series of such lectures, all of which I attended ’ 

Tuckwell, author of a volume of delightful Oxford reminiscences, also went to the lectures with Dr (afterwards Sir Thomas) Acland, the physician Acland, he said, was disturbed, fidgeted, bit his nails, and remarked ‘It frightens one\*’ Tuckwell wrote that these lectures taught him the novel doctrine of Aryan migrations, and the rationale of Greek myths Story-Maskelyne, another Oxford figure and Professor of Mineralogy, also attended, and after Muller’s death described the impression the lectures had made on him fifty years before 

Well do I remember his lectures It was a new star in the Oxford firmament I do not think any Oxford man — unless it was Church of Oriel [afterwards Dean of St Paul’s] — could have given such a course of lectures It was a new light, a new idea of literature and lecture, that Max imported mto the grey old walls of beautiful Oxford 

Story-Maskelyne added that Philip Pusey, son of the great Doctor, rode over with his boy-son all the way from his place near Faringdon sixteen miles away to hear each lecture\* c An early homage to the rising fame of the redactor of the Rig-Veda ’ Finally Story-Maskelyne wrote 

Natural science was not in high vogue then at Oxford, but the leaves on the trees were beginning to stir, so that when Max proclaimed his thesis that Comparative Philology and the historical development of f language should rank with the Natural Sciences, there was a little rustle 
! of scepticism, though in fact he was anticipating the assertion of evo- 
lution being the key to Natural Science 

Max Muller’s next philological excursion was an essay on the

Turanian languages contributed to Bunsen’s Christianity and Mankind , and published in 1854, though written almost entirely in 1853 This led to a controversy with Renan, which to the credit of both was ended quickly Renan found Muller’s views unacceptable, and in his Histoire generate des longue semitiques , published in 1855, made a sharp attack on Muller’s views on the Turanian languages 

Muller became very angry, and wrote a long and fierce review of Renan’s book and had it printed as a pamphlet Renan then wrote to Muller ‘Pardonnez-moi, je n’ai pas compns ce que vous vouhez dire \* Upon this Muller suppressed the pamphlet, though its printing must have cost him some money, and afterwards he and Renan became intimate friends Later in his life Muller gave up all the views on the Turanian languages expressed in the essay, as they were disproved by subsequent researches 

In carrying on his linguistic studies and researches for their own sake, Max Muller never forgot that they had a bearing on practical affairs So it is not surprising to find him drawn, as soon as his standing as a linguist became known, into linguistic discussions arising out of cultural, administrative and even military activities 

In March 1853 the Crimean War began and, as the British army despatched there had to be familiar with the languages of the region. Sir Charles Trevelyan asked Muller for information about the languages of the northern part of the Turkish Empire and the adjoining Russian provinces, with which the officers serving in the war should become acquainted Max Muller at once wrote a long pamphlet on Languages of the Seat of War The comer of Europe from north Italy to the Danube, he said, was a real linguistic rookery, in which all the lost daughters of the European family of languages had taken refuge This book needed a second edition in a year 

At the end of 1854 Macaulay invited Max Muller to his rooms in the Albany to discuss with him the new regulations for the Indian Civil Service, so far as they related to the teaching of Oriental subjects and languages During his membership of the Council of the Governor-General of India twenty years before, Macaulay had shown himself to be the most vigorous and effectual supporter of English as the medium for the education of Indians, and had imposed his views on the Indian Government It was also well known that he was no admirer of Oriental learning and literature. But Muller thought that he would perhaps be open to conversion,

and went to the great man armed with facts and arguments to counter Macaulay’s As he wrote in his autobiography at the end of his life, he went back to Oxford a sadder, and — he hoped — a wiser man, for Macaulay never gave him a chance to put in a word Macaulay said that he knew nothing of Indian languages and literature, and wanted to know all that Muller had to say about the advantages to be derived by young civilians from a study of Sanskrit He put some questions, but before Muller had a chance to answer any one of them, he began to relate his experiences in India, ending up with the usual diatribes against the natives of India on the score of their untruthfulness and untrustworthmess in a court of law 

Muller soon engaged himself in another linguistic campaign which was more ambitious, and which he sustained in one form or another throughout his life It was for establishing schools for the study of Oriental languages, either in the universities or as independent public institutions He had written about it to Sir Charles Trevelyan at the time of the Crimean War, when sending his report on Languages of the Seat of War In it he pointed out the connexion between the political role of England in India and a competent knowledge of Oriental languages 

It is undoubtedly high time [he wrote] that something should be done to encourage the study of Oriental languages in England In all other countries which have any political, commercial, and religious connexion with the East, provision has been made, by Government or otherwise, to encourage young men to devote themselves to this branch of studies Russia has always been a most liberal patron of Oriental philology The French Government has founded a school At Vienna there is an Oriental seminary Prussia finds it expedient to give encouragement to young Oriental scholars, employed afterwards with advantage as consuls and interpreters In England alone, where the most vital mterests are involved in a free intercourse with the East, hardly anything is done to foster Oriental studies 

The Indian Mutiny of 1857 filled Muller with an even greater sense of urgency in pressing the matter on the public and the government At the end of the year this thread was taken up, and there began the publication of a series of letters discussing the linguistic aspect of the Mutiny and making proposals for establishing a school for the study of Oriental languages The first letter which 



LANGUAGE 


183 


had the heading, On the Neglect of the Study of the Indian Languages considered as a Cause of the Indian Rebellion , was dated December 30, and was written by Max Muller under the name of Phihndus The point he made was that it was the ignorance of the language of northern India which prevented the officers of the East India Company, who were taken completely by surprise by the rebellion, from having any real intercourse with the natives, and it was the same ignorance which created a feeling of estrangement, mistrust and contempt on both sides He observed that ‘a man need not have been in India to see that in order to govern a people, and to gam the confidence and goodwill of a conquered race, it is necessary to know their language’, and then he put forward the operative part of his argument 

It ought to be, and no doubt will be, one of the first things for Parliament to declare that a study of the native dialects shall be obligatory on every candidate for the Indian civil and military services In the examinations for India it will be the duty of Government to provide candidates with the means of learnmg the Indian languages m this country, by establishing an Oriental college 

This letter was followed by six others, two from Max Muller writing as Philmdus, two from Sir Charles Trevelyan, one from Professor Momer Williams of the East India College of Haileybury and one from an Indian Muslim, Professor Syed Abdoolah 

In his advocacy of Indian languages Max Muller naturally stressed the importance of Sanskrit as well One part of his reasoning, as set forth in his letter of January 4, 1858, is worth quoting 

But there are other considerations of a more subtle nature perhaps [he wrote], yet of considerable weight for making an elementary knowledge of Sanskrit an essential part of a civilian’s previous education in England It has been said that Sanskrit is a dead language, but, although Sanskrit is no longer spoken by the people, it is still the very life-spring of their thoughts, their faith, their feelings, and prejudices In most countries the spoken language would at once be the key to the literature, and thiough it to the social, moral, and religious character of a nation It is not so in India There the state of literature at the present day is about the same as that of Italy at, or rather before, the time of Dante The spoken language, tl volgare , is Hindustani, Bengali, or Guzerathi , but the language of literature, law, and religion is still the classical Sanskrit 7

He also expressed a definite view as to the method which should be adopted to teach Sanskrit to young civilians He wrote 

To learn Sanskrit from a pandit in India, according to the native system of grammar, must be a most tedious process , and this is the very reason why this part of a civilian’s education should be finished in England with the assistance of grammars, dictionaries, and reading books, composed on a more rational system than the grammar of Panim, the Mahabhashya, and the Amara-kosha 

But nothing was done at that time, though Prince Albert took a lively interest in the scheme after the publication of the letters in The Times The Prmce saw clearly the disadvantage for England of not having such an institution, and spoke to Lord Granville, the Foreign Secretary, who wrote to Muller asking him to make further proposals This Muller did, but he would not go further, because at that time there was such a feeling against Germans that the association of the name of Prmce Albert and of a German scholar with the scheme would have been enough to wreck it 

More than thirty years later the idea was again taken up, and then successfully A School of Modern Oriental Studies was established by the Imperial Institute in co-operation with University College and King’s College, London, and Max Muller was asked to deliver the inaugural address He did so on January 14, 1890, at the Royal Institution, with the Prmce of Wales in the chair He recalled his plea for teaching Oriental languages and said that it had fallen on deaf ears. When imperial interests were at stake, he declared, the country had a right to expect imperial, that is, concentrated action, such as had been taken in Russia, France, Austria and Germany He dwelt on the commercial and political importance of the languages, and also explained how the task of governing India would be simplified if the governing race were able, by knowledge of their languages, to enter more readily into the thoughts, lives and aspirations of those they governed The newspapers took up the subject warmly, but Muller heard from the Chairman of the Committee of Management that there was little prospect of getting any assistance from the government, and in fact the government did not contribute anything to the maintenance of the School established by the Imperial Institute. 

Though Max Muller was writing and speaking on languages for many years, he did not make his formal appearance as a Compara-

tive Philologist until 1861 In April of that year he began a course of lectures at the Royal Institution in London, which, followed by a second series in 1863, established him as the foremost authority on philology in Bntam The original lectures were published under the title of Lectures on the Science of Language , and the book was his second full-length contribution to scholarship 

Before the lectures Muller was very nervous at the prospect of having to address a select audience of not only the intellectual but also the social elite of London Among the distinguished hearers were the Duke of Argyll, Connop Thirwall, Milman, Stanley, F D Maurice, Faraday and John Stuart Mill As the lectures proceeded the lecture-room became more and more crowded and Albemarle Street more and more blocked by the fine carriages of people who came to hear about Aryan roots, Aryan ancestors and the common Aryan home in Asia 

'It is,’ said a contemporary notice, 'a fact of no ordinary significance that, in the height of the London season, an enthusiastic audience of both sexes crowded the benches and endured the heat of a popular lecture-room, not to witness the brilliant experiments, or be fascinated by the revelations of a Faraday or an Owen, but to listen to a philosophical exposition of the inner mysteries of language ’ Max Muller’s reputation now had a solid aspect, which was fully proved when the lectures came out in book form By 1886, that is, in twenty-five years, fourteen editions were printed 

The second course of lectures was delivered by Muller from February to May 1863 There were twelve in this series, and they were more technical than the first lectures They were even better attended than the first ones, and were published in book form in the middle of 1864 Before that Muller was invited to Osborne House on the Isle of Wight, where Queen Victoria was residing, to speak on language before the royal family and suite He gave the lectures in January in the Council Chamber, and for the first one the entire company were assembled, except the Queen and her children After a while they too came in The Queen had not attended a lecture for more than ten years Max Muller proudly reported to his wife. 'She [the Queen] listened very attentively, and did not knit at all, though her work was brought ’ He was informed by the Queen’s Private Secretary how pleased she was with the lectures 

Three more expositions of Comparative Philology given by Muller in the next few years have to be noted in this chapter The 



186 SCHOLAR EXTRAORDINARY 

first of these was the Rede Lecture at Cambridge in 1868 He was mvited in January to deliver it, and at the end of May went with his wife to Cambridge It was proposed to confer the degree of LL D on him on this occasion, and also on the Arabic scholar Dr Wright and the American hydrographer Commodore Maury 

He delivered the lecture, which was entitled On the Stratification of Language , on May 29 The mam thesis was the idea that in philology, as in geology, there were stratifications which, though forming a chronological series, were exposed to simultaneous observation in their distribution, and thus enabled philologists to deduce the early development of language from the isolating stage to the agglutinative, and again from the agglutinative to the inflective 

Muller’s next address was his inaugural lecture after being appointed to the chair of Comparative Philology created expressly for him at Oxford, and this was delivered on October 27, 1868 His third was also an inaugural lecture, delivered on May 23, 1872, before the Imperial University of Strassburg created after Alsace had become part of the German Empire 

By that time, largely through Muller’s own writings and speeches, the claims and value of the science of Comparative Philology had been established and its far-ranging importance recognized To sum up the stage reached at that date in the words Muller himself used in his Strassburg address ‘This short survey must suffice to show you how omnipresent the Science of Language has become in all spheres of human knowledge, and how far its limits have been extended, so that it often seems impossible for one man to embrace the whole of its vast domain ’ Henceforward Muller’s purely philological interests were never merely linguistic, on the one hand they merged in his wider interest in the origin and nature of thought, mythology and religion, and on the other involved him in some very acrimonious controversy Therefore 1872 is a convenient date at which to summarize Muller’s purely linguistic ideas and define his role as a philologist 

In the most popular and easily recognized aspect of his activity as such, Max Muller is comparable to two of his famous contemporaries, T. H. Huxley and Matthew Arnold Just as Huxley carried on propaganda for evolution and Arnold for criticism, Muller also preached the cause of philology for its indispensability to the mental effort summed up in the age-old saying Know thy-

self His skill in presenting ideas and success in the propaganda into which he put his heart, were shown by the number and quality of the audiences he attracted This power to interest and hold attention even for the most abstruse matters he retained till the end of his life When he delivered the first course of his Gifford Lectures in Glasgow in November 1889, it was followed by all the distinguished Scottish intellectuals in the city Principal Caird attended the lectures, as did Dr Dickson, the Divinity Professor and Professor Edward Caird Most significant of all, it was the undergraduates who paid unqualified tribute to Muller’s power of holding attention Describing their attendance, a Glasgow paper wrote 

Your university student is generally thought to be a very rowdy individual, and yet it must be confessed that no one listens to a good lecture with closer attention than he The whistling of Two Lovely Black Eyes by the students of Glasgow University did not promise well for the attention Professor Max Muller would receive in delivering the first of his Gifford Lectures in the Bute Hall on Wednesday, but when the famous scholar plunged into his subject he could not have wished for a more attentive audience 

From the 1,400 on the first day, Muller’s audience settled down to a steady 1,000 throughout the course, which compared with the fifty an Oxford professor could get as a fair number, spoke well not only for Muller but also for the Scots Muller appealed also to people in whom one would not assume the existence of any active intellectual interest For instance, as a man in the Cab Office, Edinburgh, wrote to him. T am all the poorer today in that I missed hearing you when you were lecturing m Edinburgh, but I shall deem it a misfortune indeed if I am not present at your concluding lecture ’ On a previous occasion, when travelling with his whole family from South Wales, he was greatly helped by the guard, and he offered him a tip. But the guard said ‘Oh, sir, would you send me instead one of your books ? I have read some of them ’ 

This appeal was created by Max Muller in the first instance by the clarity of his style He was an admirer of clear writing, and he tried to be as clear as possible himself In 1861 he wrote to Renan ‘There is that charm about your views and opinions, that they are carved out of marble and not out of plaster . I cannot help thinking that there is nothing that cannot be made clear, and bright, and simple, 



188 SCHOLAR EXTRAORDINARY 

and that obscurity arises in all cases from slovenly thinking and lazy writing J 

In advising Tame how to speak when he was invited to lecture at Oxford in 1871, he wrote 

Oxford is an extremely difficult place to lecture m, because all audiences are very mixed It is difficult to hit where there are so many targets I should lecture as if I were addressing a highly educated lady, not ta kin g much for granted, making everything clear by a full statement of facts, but then drawing out the very best lessons that the facts will yield 

This in a nutshell was a complete theory of employing language to communicate ideas, but not one expected from a philologist There was general recognition of the skill which Muller displayed in presenting his ideas For instance, in the obituary published the day after his death, The Times wrote . 

Some contemporaries questioned the accuracy of his verbal scholarship No one could question his gifts as a man of letters Renan and Darmesteter — to mention two Oriental scholars — writing in their own tongues, were perhaps greater masters of making Science speak gracefully, but in lucidity of arranging the most imposing matters, in power of generalization, in a certain large charity of spirit he had no superior 

This, however, lowered Muller in the eyes of specialists and academic scholars, among whom there is a deep suspicion of both popular fame and clarity of literary style Bergson was called ‘a philosopher of the drawing-rooms’ on account of this by the German admirers of Rudolph Eucken 

But no writer can be effective, that is to say, proselytize others with his ideas by being only a stylist In fact, he cannot even acquire style, for style is the man himself, and the man himself has to possess the charity of which The Times spoke, which is the same charity of which St Paul spoke. Not only great thoughts, but also the power to preach thoughts, come from the heart It was by speaking from his heart that Max Muller touched the hearts of his hearers and readers Mere scholarship would not have given him that power. He was very eloquent in expounding even dry linguistic ideas That came from his faith in his ideas He publicly stated his credo in the concluding words of his address at Strassburg, from which I shall quote the passage in which he himself cited Niebuhr: 



LANGUAGE 


189 


Allow me in conclusion, to recall to your remembrance another passage from Niebuhr He belongs to the good old race of German scholars ‘Above all things/ he writes, ‘we must in all scientific pursuits preserve our truthfulness so pure that we thoroughly eschew every false appearance , that we represent not even the smallest thing as certain of which we are not completely convinced, that if we have to propose a conjecture, we spare no effort in representing the exact degree of its probability If we do not ourselves, when it is possible, indicate our errors, even such as no one else is likely to discover, if, in laying down our pen, we cannot say in the sight of God, upon strict examination, I have knowingly written nothing that is not true , and if without deceiving either ourselves or others, we have not presented even our most odious opponents in such a light only that we could justify it upon our death-beds — if we cannot do this, study and literature serve only to make us unrighteous and sinful ’ 

‘All of us/ Max Muller added, ‘young as well as old, should keep these words before our eyes and in our hearts Thus and thus only, will our studies not miss their highest goal thus and thus only, may we hope to become true etymologists — i e , true lovers, seekers, and, [ trust, finders of truth ’ Throughout his life, both in writing and in dealing with other scholars, he followed these principles. 

Turning now to Max Muller’s views and theories about language, Lt is not easy to give a brief summary of them, for they had a very wide range, covering everything concerning language from a methodology to study it to what might be called its metaphysics. Besides, he went on re-stating them in the light of the work of other philologists and their criticism of his own work, which was very vocal However, as he never abandoned any position though he amplified or explained it in different words, it is not necessary to take a historical view of his linguistic work From the very first he maintained that the science of language was one of the physical (or natural) sciences This was the theme 3f his first lecture in 1861, and in later life he became involved in some very unpleasant controversy over this But in thinking of his Dwn subject in this way he did not have in mind the distinction Detween philosophy and science which was a matter of discussion r or many philosophical writers This distinction hardly existed for mm, for he passed quite naturally from a strictly scientific study of anguage to sweeping philosophical speculations about its nature md origin 



190 SCHOLAR EXTRAORDINARY 

The distinction which he kept in view when he called linguistics one of the physical sciences was a different one, and in his view more basic This was the distinction which, according to him, existed between the physical or natural sciences and the historical or moral sciences The former, he said, dealt with the creations of God (by which he meant what we would call creations of Nature) and the latter with the creations of man, such as his tools, crafts, arts or literature In support of this view he first of all pointed out that the science of language had developed in three stages, as all the physical sciences had These were, first, the empirical stage concerned with the collection and examination of facts, then the classificatory stage in which the inter-relation of the facts was studied, and the third was the theoretical stage, which he also called the metaphysical, in which the student searched for the origin and meaning of all the facts which the classificatory stage had shown to belong to one or many systems In the development of all the physical sciences these stages followed one another in a chronological order, except for rare departures from the sequence The science of language, too, was developing in that order 

But, basically, his concept of the science of language was the product of a concept of the nature of language, and not merely derived from methodology He could not regard language as a creation of man, and went even further in holding that man could not modify language by an exercise of conscious will He put that view quite strongly 

Although there is a continuous change in language, it is not in the power of man either to produce or to prevent it We might think as well of changing the laws which control circulation of our blood, or of adding an inch to our height, as of altering the laws of speech, or inventing new words according to our pleasure As man is the lord of nature only if he knows her laws and submits to them, the poet and the philosopher become the lords of language only if they know its laws and obey them 

Max Muller had to emphasize the powerlessness of the human will in respect of language in order to counteract the theological view derived from the Book of Genesis, which was still current in his time Perhaps the idea has to be kept in mind today too, on account of the growing habit of using language very carelessly All illiterate ages and men look upon grammar as a tyrannical imposition

191 


on language, instead of regarding it as the anatomy and physiology of language which can be discovered but not invented by man But of course Muller was perfectly aware that language was not wholly a natural production, and that the conception of it as a natural phenomenon had to be qualified by recognizing that it also arose from the human mind, both in its conscious and unconscious workings The role of the human mind in shaping language he defined in the second edition of his lectures on The Science of Language published in 1862, in the following words: 

The process through which language is settled and unsettled, combines m one the two opposite elements of necessity and free-will Though the individual seems to be the prime mover in producing new words and new grammatical forms, he is so only after his individuality has been merged in the common action of the family, tribe, or nation to which he belongs He can do nothing by himself, and the first impulse to a new formation in language, though given by an individual , is mostly given without premeditation, nay, unconsciously The individual as such is powerless, and the results apparently produced by him, depend on laws beyond his control, and on the co-operation of all those who form together with him one class, one body, or one organic whole But though it is easy to show that language cannot be changed or moulded by the taste, the fancy, or genius of man, it is nevertheless through the instrumentality of man alone that language can be changed 

Language, he said by way of summing up the case he was making, reflects the double nature of man, half animal and half a sentient being ‘With one foot language stands, no doubt, in the realm of nature, but with the other in the realm of the spirit \* This naturally led him to raise the question which he himself put in these words ‘Every language has to be learnt, but who made the language that was to be learnt ^ But this question, he said, could not be answered by simply recounting its history, for that history did not seem to have any beginning 

The history of language [he wrote] opens a vista which makes one feel almost giddy if one tries to see the end of it, but the measurmg-rod of the chronologist seems to me entirely out of place Those who have eyes to see will see the immeasurable distance between the first historical appearance of language and the real beginnings of human speech those who cannot see will oscillate between the wildly large figures of the Buddhists or the wildly small figures of the Rabbis, but they will never lay hold of what by its very nature is indefinite

Max Muller stated quite definitely that there was no means of solving the problem of language historically , that is to say, by describing what happened in a certain locality and at a certain time, because history did not begin till long after mankind had acquired language Nothing, he declared, would be more interesting than to be able to say from historical records by what exact process man began to use words, and to be rid for ever of all the theories about the origin of language But this knowledge was denied to historians and scientists Indeed, the problem appeared so insoluble in his time that the Societe de Linguistique of Paris, founded shortly before he delivered his first lectures and composed of the most distinguished scholars of France, laid down in its rules that it would not receive any communication on the question of the origin of languages 

However, there was a second-best If nobody could trace the events through which any language was produced, perhaps it might not be impossible to infer the process through which languages might have been formed This, it may be recalled, was what Darwin sought to do about the origin of species, because in his time the palaeontological evidence of the appearance of animals in a sequence of more and more complex forms was not exhaustive, and even if it were it would not have established evolution, but only the appearance of species at successive points of time, which might have been particular creations without being simultaneous Darwin was therefore more concerned with the process by means of which evolution might have taken place, than with merely establishing evolution as the successive appearance of animals of different species on earth. Max Muller also applied himself to lay bare the linguistic processes, including both structural and functional changes. 

What, however, he could not accept, even after considering linguistic processes exhaustively, was an extension of the Darwinian theory of evolution to the origin of language. Although he was ready to admit the evolution of man from pre-existmg species in his bodily attributes, he could not do so in regard to language This puzzled the Duke of Argyll, who wrote to him on February 2, 1872. Tn fact, I am quite unable to understand why you oppose Darwinism so much as applied to language — when your views as to religion seem to me essentially Darwinian ’ Muller replied to this question on the 4th

Where I differ from Darwin is when he does not see that nothing can become actual but what was potential , that mere environment explains nothing, because what surrounds and determines is as much given as what is surrounded and determined , that both presuppose each other and are meant for each other Now I take my stand against Darwin on language, because language is the necessary condition of every other mental activity, religion not excluded, and I am able to prove that this indispensable condition of all mental growth is entirely absent in animals This is my palpable argument 

There is, however, another argument, based on the nature of all known languages, viz , that they presuppose the faculty of numbering, an argument somewhat Pythagorean, but not therefore the less true Even if it could be proved that man was the lineal descendant of an ape, that would not upset my argument The ape who could become the ancestor of man, would be a totally different bemg from the ape that remained for ever the ancestor of apes That ape would be simply an embryonic man, and we have no ground to be very proud of our own embryonic phases 

He said that nobody could doubt that certain animals possess all the physical requirements of articulate speech For instance, there was no letter of the alphabet which a parrot would not learn to pronounce Therefore the fact that the parrot was without a language of its own had to be explained by a difference between the mental and not the physical faculties of animals and men Next, the higher animals had a share of the mental faculties of man Nobody, he said, could dispute that the higher animals had sensation, perception, memory , will and also intellect if it was restricted to the correlation of single perceptions What then, he asked, was the fundamental difference between man and the brute world ? He answered without hesitation £ The one great barrier between the brute and man is Language Man speaks, and no brute has ever uttered a word Language is our Rubicon, and no brute will dare to cross it 5 He went on repeating this idea, and the impossibility of man’s ever developing his faculty of speech from the animal stage by any process of natural selection similar to the mode of creation of species assumed by the Darwinian theory of evolution, and most emphatically he did so in his book The Science of Thought , published in 1887 

By no effort of understanding, by no stretch of imagination, can I explain to myself how language could have grown out of anything

which animals possess, even if we granted them millions of years for that purpose If anything has a right to the name of specific difference, it is language, as we find it in man, and in man only Even if we removed the name of specific difference from our philosophic dictionaries, I should still hold that nothing deserves the name of man except what is able to speak 

Of course, Max Muller was thinking of evolution in terms of Darwin’s natural selection, when the idea of mutation had not been advanced and anything like creative evolution as distinct from adaptive evolution had not been thought of 

Max Muller took the view that the results of the science of language did not tally with the results of evolutionism up to his time, and words could not be derived directly from the imitative and emotive sounds made by animals A barrier had been raised between the two kinds of sounds by the very nature of the symbolic sounds to which the science of language had traced back the origins of true language, and which the philologists called roots These roots, from which with certain exceptions all words were derived, were expressions of general concepts, and unless animals were capable of airivmg at general concepts language could only have originated with man On this point Muller argued as follows\* 

We do not know anything and cannot possibly know anything of the mind of animals therefore, the proper attitude of the philosopher with regard to the mental capacities of animals is one of complete neutrality For all we know, the mental capacities of animals may be of a higher order than our own, as their sensuous capacities certainly are in many cases All this, however, is guesswork, one thing only is certain If we are right that man realizes his conceptual thought by means of words, derived from roots, and that no animal possesses words derived from roots, it follows, not indeed that animals have no conceptual thought, but that their conceptual thought is different in its realized shape from our own 

Taking this position, Max Muller was bound to hold that the origin of language and the origin of thought were coeval and connected, though it was impossible to ascertain when they came into existence What was fully established in his view was that the two were inseparable He could conceive of a stage of human development when man had neither language nor thought, but he could not admit that one of these could exist without the other. In all his

pronouncements and writings he repeated the idea In the second course of lectures on The Science of Language, delivered in 1863, he said that ‘to treat of sound as independent of meaning, of thought as independent of words, seems to defy one of the best principles of the science of language' 

In his very much later book (1887), in which he tried to understand thought and its processes for himself rather than for others, and to which he gave the title Science of Thought , he put the argument for taking language and thought as being inseparable much more strongly ‘It is possible/ he said, ‘to distinguish in our knowledge four things Sensations ( Empfindungen ), Percepts (Vorstellungen). Concepts (Begnffe) and names ( Namen ) But though we can distinguish them, we must not imagine that these four ever exist as separate entities No words are possible without concepts, no concepts without percepts, no percepts without sensations \* Since sensations preceded the other three, he was ready to admit as a matter of argument that they could exist independently of the others But as a matter of fact, he said, thought was utterly impossible without the simultaneous working of sensation, percepts, concepts and names, and in reality the four were inseparable In a letter to the Duke of Argyll, written on April 14, 1888, he explained his position in a less formal manner. 

It requires an effort to see the mseparableness of language and thought It has taken me a whole life to perceive it People imagine that I hold that language and thought are identical There is no sense in that No two things can be identical But they can be inseparable — neither can exist without the other, that is what I mean We imagine that we can think without words, because we can distinguish between the sound and the meaning So we can between an orange and its skm, but in rerum natura there is no skm without an orange nor orange without a skin You were one of the few men in England who I thought would see what I meant But it requires an effort, and it is only an historical study of language in all its phases that has at last led me to the conviction that the Greeks were right, and that what really makes us men and distinguishes us from the animal, is the Logos, 1 e , the gathering or, as Hobbes said, addition and subtraction 

Considering language in its next stage, that is, after it had come into existence, Max Muller held that language had growth , but not history The second of his first series of lectures was devoted to

explaining the growth of language in contradistinction to the history of language ‘We must distinguish/ he said, ‘between historical change and natural growth Art, science, philosophy, and religion all have a history, language, or any other production of nature, admits only of growth ’ But the term ‘growth 5 , he explained, must be taken, if it is applied to language, in a sense which is wholly different from what it has when employed in connexion with the natural unfolding of organic beings The idea of growth in respect of language was like the idea of growth of the crust of the earth, 1 e , a process comparable to geological formations, by means of which continuous new combinations were formed out of given elements without the control of free agents It was not surprising therefore that he should apply the term stratification to the process of linguistic evolution 

He illustrated this by giving the example of the relationship of Italian to Latin, and observed that 

If we call Italian the daughter of Latin, we do not mean to ascribe to Italian a new vital principle Not a single radical element was newly created for the formation of Italian Italian is modern Latm, or Latin ancient Italian The names mother and daughter only mark different periods in the growth of a language substantially the same To speak of Latm dying in giving birth to her offspring is again pure mythology, and it would be easy to prove that Latm was a living language long after Italian had learnt to run alone 

Growth of language so defined comprised two processes which had to be caiefully distinguished though they might be at work (Simultaneously Max Muller called these processes. Dialectal Regeneration and Phonetic Decay 

By ‘phonetic decay 5 he understood a very special aspect of the continuous phonetic changes in any language by means of which it passed from the ‘isolatory 5 stage to the ‘inflectionary 5 stage — that is to say, from the stage in which the relations of words or the various extensions and modifications of their denotations were expressed by employing two or more words with independent meaning, to the stage in which the modifying independent words lost their independence and became vestigial sounds like inflections and constituted in their totality the whole range of the accidence of a language In simple words, Max Muller said, it was phonetic decay which created truly grammatical forms

He illustrated the process by taking the word ‘twenty’ — 20 In Greek, Latm, Sanskrit, English and French the word for this number was originally composed of two elements — ten and two so that in its formation the word stands for £ two tens’, but through phonetic decay the two words together have come to stand for one concept In Chinese, however, twenty had remained two tens = eulshi without any phonetic decay It was Chinese and the monosyllabic languages related to it which, Max Muller observed, had remained immune to the disease of phonetic decay 

On the other hand, by ‘dialectal regeneration’ he understood not only the creation of a new language through the break-up of the sounds of a language which had ceased to grow by becoming written and literary, but also the entire existence of spoken words as a language unembodied in literature and writing It was only as dialects that language had growth, which always stopped when they were written down in a standard form What people were accustomed to call languages, such as the literary idioms of Greece, Rome, ancient India or modern Europe must be considered, he said, as artificial, and the real and natural life of languages was to be found only in the dialects 

According to him it was a mistake to imagine that dialects everywhere were corruptions of the literary language Even in England, he observed, the local dialects had many forms which were more primitive than the language of Shakespeare, and the richness of their vocabulary surpassed on many points that of the classical writers of English of any period. Dialects had always been the feeders rather than the channels of a literary language They were parallel streams which existed long before one of them was raised to that temporary eminence which was the result of literary cultivation 

Whatever the origin of language among men its first tendency, he said, must have been towards an unbounded variety To this there was a natural check in a parallel development towards forming a national and literary language Before there can be a national language there must be hundreds of dialects in districts, towns, villages, clans and families, and though the progress of civilization and centralization tended to reduce their number and to soften their features, it had not yet annihilated them 

Max Muller described this process of continuous break-up and reformation of language in a passage of extraordinary vividness in 



198 SCHOLAR EXTRAORDINARY 

his first series of lectures I shall give it almost wholly in his words Literary dialects pay for their temporary greatness by inevitable decay and they are haunted by their own ghost They are like stagnant lakes at the side of great rivers They form reservoirs of what was once living and running speech, but they are no longer carried on by the mam current At times it may seem as if the whole stream of language was absorbed by these lakes, and we can hardly trace the small rivulets which run on in the mam bed 

Or, he said, it may be more accurate to compare a classical or literary idiom with the frozen surface of a river, brilliant and smooth, but stiff and cold It is mostly by political commotions that this surface of more polite and cultivated speech is broken and carried away by the waters rising from underneath It is during times when the higher classes are either crushed in religious or social struggles, or mix again with the lower classes to repel foreign invasion, when literary occupations are discouraged, palaces burnt, monasteries pillaged and seats of learning destroyed , it is then that the popular dialects, which had formed a kind of undercurrent, rise beneath the crystal surface of the literary language and sweep away, like the waters in spring, the cumbrous formations of a bygone age , 

^ In more peaceful times, a new and popular literature springs up m a language which seems to have been formed by conquest and revolutions, but which in reality had been growing up long before, and was only brought out, ready-made, by historical events From this point of view, we can see that no literary language can ever be said to have been the mother of another language As soon as a language loses its undoubted capacity for change, its carelessness about what it throws away, and its readiness in always supplying the wants of mind and heart instantaneously, its natural life is changed into a merely artificial existence It may still live on for a long time, but while it seems to be the leading shoot, it is in reality but a broken and withering branch, slowly falling from the stock from which it sprang/ 

These are a few of Max Muller's ideas about language which I have selected for their general interest out of an immense number which were always coming out of his active and fertile mind It will however be noticed that all of these ideas relate to that stage of the science of language which he called the theoretical That was the field in which lay his deepest and most active interest. But these

conclusions, philosophical rather than strictly linguistic as they were, had their basis on a very solid knowledge of linguistic facts in the other two stages of the science, namely, the empirical and the classificatory His mastery of these facts was certainly greater than that which Spengler had of historical facts in presenting his philosophy of history, and would seem to be more complete than the knowledge of the past of different human groups which Toynbee had when he wrote his Study of History The dislike which contemporary specialists feel for sweeping generalizations is only a narrow intellectual pose, or rather a fashion It is not intellectually justifiable Generalization and detailed study of facts are only two sides of the same process of knowing They may alternate cyclically, or they may be taken up by persons of different but complementary temperaments at the same time, or even by the same person to satisfy two sides of his yearning for knowledge No one could say that Eddington, Jeans, or in these times Hoyle or Heisenberg, as mathematicians or physicists, had no right to their cosmological speculations In regard to the empirical stage of the science of language, Max Muller was one of the great authorities of his age He was a pioneer m Sankritic studies both as an explorer and as an exploiter And since it was the discovery and knowledge of Sanskrit which had created the science of Comparative Philology, the empirical foundations of his theories cannot be said to have been inadequate Max Muller himself knew this very well, and wrote 

Sanskrit certainly forms the only foundation of Comparative Philology, and it will always remain the only safe guide through all its intricacies. A comparative philologist without a knowledge of Sanskrit is like an astronomer without a knowledge of mathematics He may admire, he may observe, he may discover, but he will never feel satisfied, he will never feel certain, he will never feel quite at home 

Perhaps there was a certain amount of exaggeration in this statement, but that was not unnatural in an age (1868) when Sanskrit was still the mam element in the growing science of linguistics. 

In the classificatory stage of the science Max Muller's writings not only established the concept of an Indo-European family of languages more firmly, but they also popularized it in a manner nobody else rivalled But his own special contribution in the field of classification or taxonomy of language was not purely philological it extended to the social and cultural spheres He spread the idea of

a common Aryan family and culture, from which a number of related societies and cultures had evolved It had important social, cultural and even political consequences in many countries So its character and validity will have to be examined later. 

What remains to be done here is only to place Max Muller’s linguistic work in its proper perspective in the history of the science of linguistics Long before his death, in fact even from the middle of the seventies, his ideas on language began to be challenged, and many later workers in the field thought that they were being superseded But hardly any pioneer worker in any science would expect or even wish it to be otherwise, although he might have made a fundamental contribution to its creation But such a statement about Max Muller’s work would apply only to the more technical part of his contribution His speculations covered the origin and nature of language, about which the present age, in spite of all the research which has followed, is no more certain than was Max Muller’s age In the very nature of things there can be no finality on such questions 

In any case, Max Muller was perfectly aware of his position, and if he was being left behind he showed himself to be perfectly reconciled to the possibility He knew very well that it was the inevitable fate of all investigators. He noted this in the case of Professor H H Wilson, who was really the first genuine English Sanskritist on the strength of his own knowledge of the language Of him Muller said that he had done nothing but original work, but was abused for not always having found at the first trial what others discovered when standing on his shoulders In his posthumous autobiography he said the same thing about himself in connexion with an essay of his on the Turanian languages Tt was published’, he wrote, \*m 1854, but it still continues to be criticized as if it had been published last year ’ Then he commented wisely, though also sadly ‘No astronomer is blamed for not having known the planet Neptune before its discovery in 1846, or having been wrong in accounting for the irregularities of Saturn But let that pass I only share the fate of others who have lived too long ’ 

But there was more to it By living as long as he did, Max Muller passed from one age of learning to another, not only in respect of his own subject but of all subjects that is to say, from the age of exploration to that of intensive cultivation By the end of the nineteenth century the age of specialization was already in full stride

But to say that for this reason all that had preceded was obsolete, is like saymg that it is only reaping that matters, and not sowing Max Muller began his linguistic work in the full age of wonder of his science, and he was perfectly aware of the function of wonder in the progress of human knowledge ‘Wonder/ he observed in his Rede Lecture delivered before the University of Cambridge in 1868, ‘no doubt rises from ignorance, but from a peculiar kind of ignorance, from what might be called a fertile ignorance, an ignorance which, if we look back at the history of most of our sciences, will be found to have been the mother of all human knowledge ’ 

But what he noted with surprise was that the wonder that was incentive to knowledge was not present in respect of all subjects in any particular age For ages, he said, men had looked at the earth with its stratifications and at the embedded petnfications of orgamc creatures, and yet they looked and passed on, thinking no more of it, and without wondering Not even an Aristotle had eyes to see, so that the conception of a science of earth was reserved for the eighteenth century. 

In the same way, he added, men regarded language without wonder Centuries had elapsed since the first names were given to all cattle, to the fowls of the air, and to all beasts — here, too, the clearly marked lines of different strata seemed almost to challenge attention, but still the conception of a science of language was reserved for the nineteenth century 

In all his work on language Max Muller continued the age of wonder of linguistics both for himself and his readers and hearers He made a wide circle of men and women aware of the romance of language, as he was himself attracted by the romance He could say: 

Bliss was it in that dawn to be alive, 

But to be young was very heaven \*
