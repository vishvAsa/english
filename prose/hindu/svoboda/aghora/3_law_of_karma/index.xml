      <description>&lt;p&gt;“WHY DO YOU THINK I own horses and come to the race track?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Vimalananda and I sat, in March 1977, on his usual bench in the First En closure of the Bombay Racecourse. We had reached there well in advance of the first race, and while we awaited the arrival of his colleagues, the friendly gamblers with whom he would wrangle, wager and roar, the man who was my mentor sprang this question on me.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I MET VIMALANANDA first in September 1975 on the day that Elan, one of his most reliable mares, won her first race for him. I first accompanied him to the races on the day of Stoney&amp;rsquo;s last outing. Horse racing began in Bombay in the early decades of the nineteenth century when a race ground emerged in what is now the predominantly Christian district of Byculla. When the time came to search for greener pastures, the Royal Western India Turf Club Limited (R.W.I.T.C. for short) selected a low-lying site near Bombay&amp;rsquo;s fa mous temple of Mahalakshmi, the goddess of wealth and prosperity. Most members of the Indian racing public mistakenly assume that the Mahalak shmi racecourse, which is among the world&amp;rsquo;s most beautiful wagering ven ues, was a British production. In truth it was an Indian, Sir Cusrow N. Wadia, the Parsi who was then head of the textile giant Bombay Dyeing, who over saw the entire project from concept through planning to construction. He gave the club an interest-free loan of Rs. 4 million ($10 million or more in to day&amp;rsquo;s dollars) and went himself to Melbourne, Australia to obtain a blue print. Thanks to his farsightedness there is only one turn for all races up to and including 1600 meters (one mile).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;BOMBAY&amp;rsquo;S SUMMER USUALLY begins near the end of March. With the summer of 1977 summer came the problem of where to send Stoney to brood. Pedigrees of all sorts fascinated Vimalananda; when we watched Wimbledon together he would sigh and say, “If only Jimmy Connors and Chrissy Evert would get together, their child would really be something!!” Now he had the opportunity to select the genes that would mingle with those of his beloved Stoney. He invested more and more of his spare time in pedi gree comparisons, to ensure that the ensuing foal would bring glory to its mare&amp;rsquo;s name.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;IN EARLY 1978 I was introduced to Vimalananda&amp;rsquo;s newest horse, a hand some compact colt named Timir, when I watched him win his first race. This occasion was also noteworthy for me—it was the first time I had been able to cheer home one of Vimalananda&amp;rsquo;s horses..and I found winning to be as electrifying a feeling as he had promised it would be. For the first time I un derstood the seduction of that sensation, how for sporting types like Vima lananda each victory could be as thrilling as his first.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;STONEY FAILED TO GET into foal at Vitu Karve&amp;rsquo;s stud farm even in early 1978, due at least in part to Vitu&amp;rsquo;s unwillingness to spend much money on her feed. Vimalananda soon decided to send her elsewhere, but where? All the other stud farms insisted on seeing the color of his coin. When things seemed bleakest Nature stepped in, as She usually did for Vimalananda in a pinch. This time She arrived in the form of Mr. Gokuldas Madhavdas, a friendly industrialist and race horse owner growling his way through life. Gokuldas, who to my eye most resembled a mature and knowledgeable frog, was introduced to Vimalananda by Gokuldas&amp;rsquo;s shy niece Prabha, who brought her angelic voice to Vimalananda for training on a regular basis. On hearing of Stoney&amp;rsquo;s dilemma Gokuldas insisted on attempting to prevail on Erach Ghasvala, a dapper Parsi who owned a stud in the South, to accept Stoney into his farm on favorable terms. This was a boon in itself, but the ic ing on the cake—in Hindi we say &amp;ldquo;the fragrance on the gold”—was that Scar let Ruby stood in Erach&amp;rsquo;s yard.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;AS BOMBAY&amp;rsquo;S IMPORTANCE in my life accelerated I increasingly under stood why Vimalananda had had to leave his life of many years as a itinerant sadhu and resettle in his hometown. Bombay was so crowded for him with tangled heaps of rnanubandhanas that nothing less than physical residence there would suffice for their unravelling. People daily arrived at his doorstep to confront him with shopping lists of cravings to be satisfied, but few of these solicitants showed any concern for him or his condition. Most were lit tle more than embodied karmic debts who were striving to entrap him, and few of this group appreciated interference from his own Jaya and Vijaya (Roshni and me). Fortunately none of them possessed the power of the San atkumaras, or their curses would have kept Vimalananda busy preventing his doorkeepers from falling deep into Patala. Roshni&amp;rsquo;s strategies and protocols may have differed from mine but our ends were the same: to preserve as much as possible of Vimalananda&amp;rsquo;s energy from being suckled from him by these smarmy vampires and to keep conditions in the flat from going com pletely cattywampus.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;OUR GREATEST TINGLE during the Spring 1979 Bombay Race Meeting was the announcement of a blessed event: the debut in our world of Stoney&amp;rsquo;s first foal, a colt whom Vimalananda promptly named Redstone. The spring&amp;rsquo;s most unusual incident, however, occurred midseason when Vimalananda felt obliged to exercise yet another of his siddhis to deal with Behram, the husband of Shernaz and father of Arzoo. He had unexpectedly and inoppor tunely arrived in Poona from Iran just in time for Navroz, the ancient Persian New Year&amp;rsquo;s Day which many Indian Zoroastrians still celebrate.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;VIMALANANDA&amp;rsquo;S INTEREST IN his spiritual children&amp;rsquo; had been corrod ing for some time, for they were proving to be no more dedicated than Shan karacharya&amp;rsquo;s &amp;lsquo;sons. It waned yet further on the morning that he had a visitation from Doshi&amp;rsquo;s wife. She and Doshi had come to Poona that weekend to accompany us for some homa nearby, and were staying in the hotel room that was next door to Vimalananda&amp;rsquo;s. Apparently these two, conniving per haps with some of the other children, had decided that it was time for Vima lananda to part with some of his Tantric sexual knowledge. Mrs. Doshi had therefore knocked at Vimalananda&amp;rsquo;s door braless, her sari barely covering her sagging middle-aged bosoms, to beseech this expert for a Vajroli practicum, or at the very least a how-to course in Lata Mudra. It was very difficult for me to see how the evidently dissolute Mrs. Doshi could have any chance to suc ceed at Lata Mudra, a practice in which two sexual partners invoke Lord Shiva and his Grand Consort Parvati into their bodies before they dally together. How then could she even dream of Vajroli, in which you use your genitals to suck up your partner&amp;rsquo;s secretions during intercourse?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;HAD I KNOWN THEN what I know now of Vimalananda&amp;rsquo;s Junior Guru Maharaj I would have concluded that in the act of awarding him the tran sient felicity of Redstone&amp;rsquo;s win Guru Maharaj had successfully stolen one of the few remaining joys from Vimalananda&amp;rsquo;s life. Vimalananda, who must have suspected it all along, tried unsuccessfully to reveal this to me not long after the taxi-driver episode, during the course of an afternoon spent at Bhuleshwar. After offering our worship we sat resting inside the front pas sageway when Vimalananada looked me over in a unusually peculiar way and said, &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;ve told you before about Lord Krishna and His siddhi of Kartum, Akartum, Anyathakartum.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;THE FACTS OF VIMALANANDA&amp;rsquo;S dying are as easy to recount as they were tortuous to live through. Somehow I succeeded at cremating him at Bombay&amp;rsquo;s Banganga Smashan, just as eight years and three months previously he had prophesied that I would. And, just as he had promised all those years ago, his wife and children did not come to watch the pyre, for their egos still smarted from his failure to attend his daughter&amp;rsquo;s wedding. As the flames devoured him the mournful tones of his last request—“Precious Lord, Take My Hand,&amp;quot; sung by Jim Reeves&amp;ndash;ascended toward the heavens with the smoke. I kept rewinding the tape until when it finally snapped I concluded that he had had enough. Thereafter I sat silently, dreading the moment that the fire would die down and I would have to leave Vimalananda&amp;rsquo;s hands be hind me for good.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
