      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;vimalanandas-dedication-for-this-book&#34;&gt;VIMALANANDA’S DEDICATION FOR THIS BOOK&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dedicated to One who is the source of life&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Dynamic Cosmic Energy which pervades&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;the entire universe perennially&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The fountainhead of supreme joy, divinity, and magnanimity:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Portrait of Vimalananda&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;(taken from a photograph and drawn by Dr. Vasant D. Lad.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;my-mother-tara&#34;&gt;My Mother Tara&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Vimalananda, the subject of this book, designed the cover and dictated to the author the following regarding its symbolic meaning:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;“&lt;em&gt;Ghora&lt;/em&gt; is darkness, the darkness of ignorance. &lt;em&gt;Aghora&lt;/em&gt; means light, the absence of darkness. Under the Tree of Knowledge is an Aghori, a follower of the path of Aghora. He has gone beyond ignorance thanks to the Flame of Knowledge which billows from the funeral pyre. The funeral pyre is the ultimate reality, a continual reminder that everyone has to die. Knowledge of the ultimate reality of Death has taken the Aghori beyond the Eight Snares of Existence: lust, anger, greed, delusion, envy, shame, disgust and fear which bind all beings. The Aghori plays with a human skull, astonished by the uselessness of limited existence, knowing the whole world to be within him though he is not in the world. His spiritual practices have awakened within him the power of Kundalini, which takes the form of the goddess dancing on the funeral pyre: Smashan Tara. He is bewildered to think that all is within him, not external to him; that he sees it not with the physical eyes but with the sense of perception. The Flame of Knowledge is that which preserves life, the Eternal Flame, the Supreme Ego, the Motherhood of God which creates the whole Maya of the universe and thanks only to Whose grace the Aghori has become immortal.”&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;To be a guru you have to say, “I know and I can teach you.” But if I say that, well, I’m finished. I can never learn anything else. I have shut myself off from anything new. If I remain a student all my life, though, I will always be ready to learn new things.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I never call any of the people who come to me for spiritual guidance “disciples.” I am just an ordinary person. I have lived unknown and I will die unknown, except to a few. I am not interested in anything the world can offer me and even if I die tomorrow I have no regrets. I have lived my life to the fullest; I have done enough. I’ll always be thankful to Nature for permitting me to achieve so much. I will never have disciples, only “children,” because that is the way a real guru should treat a disciple: as a spiritual son or daughter. And the bond between them is far more intense than that between a physical parent and child.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>02 SHAKTI</title>

      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;When I’m disgusted, fed up with the world, I always turn to my Mother. She comes to me in any form I request, and we play that way. Sometimes She comes as my Mother, sometimes as my wife, sometimes as my child. She’s always with me; She’ll never go away. Long ago we promised each other to stay together always. If She ever leaves me I will not live even an instant longer. Who is She? My ego, the Shakti which self-identifies with my body. If She leaves me I have to die. Most people don’t know the true value of the ego, and they misuse Her. But I think I am the luckiest man in the world, because my Smashan Tara has taught me all about my own ego, and how to realize Her as Adya, the Original Shakti. She is the being to be realized.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>03 SHIVA</title>

      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The world considers You inauspicious, O Destroyer of Lust who plays in the smashan smeared with the ash from funeral pyres, wearing a necklace of human skulls, with ghouls for comrades. But for those who remember You with devotion, O Bestower of Boons, You are supremely auspicious. (Shiva Mahimna Stotra, 24)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MAHAKALA&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One day I said to Smashan Tara, “You are my Ma, my Mother, but who is my Father? I know the Mother always shows the child the face of its Father, so won’t You show me mine?” We have a saying in Hindi: “Only your conscience knows all your sins, and only a child’s mother knows its true father.” Without Smashan Tara I could never have succeeded at the sadhana for Her Grand Consort, Lord Shiva. Tantrikas and Aghoris work this way: First they achieve success at sadhana for Shakti and then use that Shakti to move on to the Universal Soul, Shiva.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Punarapi jananam, punarapi maranam, punarapi matrdareshayanam: Birth and death and living in a womb, over and over and over again.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;THE PRIMAL DEBT&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;What is the purpose of being born? To recognize yourself, to realize that you are neither the body nor the mind but rather the Eternal Soul which is the Ultimate Unity — call it Atma, Parampurusha, Brahman, or what you like.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;How is one born into the world, though? What makes an individual take birth? Some say that karma is at the root of everything, but when they are asked the origin of karma they say that karma is eternal.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>05 MENTORS</title>
      <link>https://vishvAsa.github.io/english/prose/hindu/svoboda/aghora/1_left-hand/05_MENTORS/</link>

      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nature is very kind to me; in fact, as my friend Faram used to say, Nature is cockeyed to me. And that is because of my mentors. My mentors were very good. That’s all I can say; my mentors were very good. Maybe it’s true I was meant by Nature to succeed at all my sadhanas, but my mentors triggered me up and made me succeed. They were too good.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>06 AGHORA</title>

      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;When I look at someone I don’t see them as they are now; I see them as they will be. Then I can try to change them if there is something in them I think I can change. If I love skin and bones how will I be able to help them? Skin and bones will only decay, but the individual will continue to exist even after death. That is why I can say that I love people not for their present value but for their future value; not for what they are but for what they will become, or for what they have the potential to become. This is an Aghori’s love.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>07 SPIRITS</title>

      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;If a four-year-old boy were to sit on top of his dead grandmother, pick up his father’s japamala and begin to do japa, what sort of boy would you say he is? You would have to say he was born to do Smashan Sadhana. I have seen a boy who did that. Why, even I, when I was a child, used to build toy funeral pyres out of twigs and matchsticks; it’s an inborn tendency in someone who is meant to be an Aghori.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>08 AVISHKARA</title>
      <link>https://vishvAsa.github.io/english/prose/hindu/svoboda/aghora/1_left-hand/08_AVISHKARA/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://vishvAsa.github.io/english/prose/hindu/svoboda/aghora/1_left-hand/08_AVISHKARA/</guid>
      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;One of my friends once asked me, “Is there ever one moment of the day when you are not doing Avishkara?” What could I tell him? Does he know the wonderful joy of Avishkara? He can’t imagine it because he does not really know how to love.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AVISHKARA&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When I say that spirits can be helpful, I am sure you cannot imagine all the ramifications of such a statement. Let me explain it in this way. Why do we Hindus worship stone or metal or wooden images of our deities? We are not worshipping the image; we are requesting the deity to come in His or Her ethereal form and take possession of the image, where we then concentrate our worship. We treat the image as a living being, because a ritual called &lt;em&gt;Prana Pratishtha&lt;/em&gt; is performed in which &lt;em&gt;prana,&lt;/em&gt; the life force, is actually transmitted into the image.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>09 SEX</title>

      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I have always maintained that there are two parts of the body which move even though they have no bone to support them: the tongue and the penis (or clitoris). These organs are made to move by the ego alone. They can take you to the heights of success if they are controlled, and if they are misused &lt;em&gt;—&lt;/em&gt; if you make just a single mistake in your sadhana &lt;em&gt;—&lt;/em&gt; down you go, divebombing like a Stuka.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>10 GIRNAR</title>
      <link>https://vishvAsa.github.io/english/prose/hindu/svoboda/aghora/1_left-hand/10_GIRNAR/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Human beings are nothing but sheep. I used to be in the flock of sheep, but I ran away, so it’s no surprise that everyone else, all the so-called normal people, thinks I’m insane or, at the least, abnormal. And I think the same about them. Only one of us can be right.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;GIRNAR&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I’ve always believed that when you do a thing you should forget everything else and do that one thing with heart and soul. When I was interested in mundane pursuits I was a perfect materialist. You would never in your life have imagined that I could be interested in spiritual subjects. And when I was doing sadhana, I forgot everything else and I did it. For example, for ten months in Girnar I lived in an Arka &lt;em&gt;(Calotropis gigantea)&lt;/em&gt; tree in an old cemetery, eating only Arka leaves, doing a ritual to please Anjaneya. Arka leaves cause violent purging and vomiting. Do you know how “hot” Arka is? &lt;em&gt;Arka&lt;/em&gt; means “sun” and after two or three days of eating those leaves my mouth and tongue had swollen to twice their normal size. But that didn’t stop me; I continued with the ritual. Aghoris always overdo a thing.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
