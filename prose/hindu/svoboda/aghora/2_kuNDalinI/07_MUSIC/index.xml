      <description>&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;So any kind of music, Western, Indian, or anything else, can give you results if you are sincere about it and make it into a sadhana,&amp;rdquo; I said.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;You can. I am sure that if Tukaram Maharaj, who lived here in Maharashtra almost four hundred years ago, were to come here to Bombay today and we were to play some nice Western song for him he would sit quietly and listen and enjoy it—or at least he would look as if he were enjoying it. All the time on the inside he would be hearing his mantra &amp;lsquo;Rama Krishna Hari, Jai Jai Rama Krishna Hari; Rama Krishna Hari, Jai Jai Rama Krishna Hari -set to the rhythm and melody of the music.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;He described it one evening shortly thereafter, over Scotch.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;“My family belongs to the Pushti Marga, the spiritual path (marga) whose greatest exponent was Vallabhacharya, who lived more than five hundred years ago. Some people translate &amp;lsquo;Pushti Marga&amp;rsquo; as &amp;lsquo;Path of Prosperity,&amp;rsquo; and others as ‘Path of Grace.&amp;rsquo; But when I think of pushti I remember a phrase from the Maha Mrytunjaya Mantra.” He looked at me expectantly.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;You mean, &amp;lsquo;sugandhim pushti vardhanam?&amp;rdquo; I asked.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Other Nadas are also described in the books, but these two are the most important.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;“Let me try to explain to you the differences in Nada by describing how Krishna&amp;rsquo;s hair differs from Shiva&amp;rsquo;s hair. Krishna&amp;rsquo;s hair has been compared to a swarm of bees. What does a bee do with its time? All day long it moves from flower to flower, enjoying the nectar ar each one.
