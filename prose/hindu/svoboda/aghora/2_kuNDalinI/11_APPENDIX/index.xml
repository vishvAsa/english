      <description>&lt;p&gt;Yantra, meaning &amp;ldquo;device&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;instrument,&amp;rdquo; is usually a geometric repre sentation designed to identify the mind of a worshipper with his or her cho sen deity. The Yogini Tantra says that the goddess may either be worshipped as image, mandala or yantra. A yantra is the outward form of a deity, while a mantra is the deities&amp;rsquo; subtle form. In essence the mantra is the deity, and when a yantra is inscribed with its bija mantras and empowered by conse cration the deity is installed within the yantra. Empowerment is the entry of the deities&amp;rsquo; prana into the yantra, and without this the yantra is but an empty construction. When a yantra is consecrated by auspicious rites it brings prosperity and peace and removes all malevolent influences from the worshippers family. Yantras can be used for magical purposes and when employed in destructive rituals the yantra becomes more a prison than a palace for the deity.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;a&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The tradition of the Nine Nath Siddhas stems from the flowering of Shai vite Tantra around the tenth century. The word Nath is derived from the name of Shiva and its literal meaning is &amp;ldquo;Lord.&amp;rdquo; The Naths brought to light various systems of tantric practices aimed at the transubrantation of the human body into a divine immortal body. Central to their methods were the practices of Hatha, Kundalini and Alchemical yogas. The North Indian tradi tion lists nine Naths and eighty-four Siddhas in its lineage, the most promi nent of which were Matsyendranath and Gorakhnath. Many of these eighty four Siddhas appear in the Buddhist tantric tradition, where it is sometimes said that they practiced Hindu tantra by day and Buddhist tantra at night. The various lists of the Nine Naths include: Matsyendranath, Gorakhnath, Jalandhara, Kanipa, Gopichand, Caurangi, Charpati, Dharamnath and Gaininath.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
