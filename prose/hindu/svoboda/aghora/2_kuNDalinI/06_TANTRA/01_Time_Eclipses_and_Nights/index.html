  <p>In his youth Vimalananda had studied astrology with Jina Chandra Suri, and 1 frequently witnessed his amazing ability to cast an accurate horoscope from a visitor&rsquo;s face alone. Though astrology is a respected means of diagno sis in Ayurveda it is no longer taught in Ayurvedic colleges, and I held out some hope that Vimalananda would teach me himself. But every time I asked for instruction he would refuse, saying, “You have more important things to learn right now.&quot; He relented only with regard to those aspects of astrology which he felt would be materially beneficial to my sadhana.</p>
<p>“Do you remember the three wise men?&quot; he began one day.</p>
<p>“Sure,” I replied confidently, for I had learned their names in Sunday School: “Balthazar, Melchior, and Caspar.”</p>
<p>“Right. One was an Egyptian, one an Assyrian, and one a Babylonian. They all followed the cult of the Magi, which originated in Babylon and was practiced in all three countries. It was a sort of Tantra. These three men per formed their calculations independently, and when they met and exchanged notes they found that they had all independently reached the same conclu sion: a prophet would be born. Then they set out to follow the star, and they found Jesus.</p>
<p>“This was a unique occasion, of course, but it shows the practical benefits</p>
<p>[163]</p>
<p>AGHORA II: Kundalini</p>
<p>of astrology. In fact, knowledge of time can pay dividends in all sorts of ways. Suppose you should find a rare white-flowering Flame of the Forest tree. This in itself is not so easy; I have found only two in the whole state of Maharashtra, and they are entwined together. If you can find one, though, and if you can take its wood during a certain astrological conjunction you can work wonders with it; you can even fly. But you must collect the wood at precisely the right moment. All of Tantra is based on time. If you do something at the right moment you get the result, otherwise, no.</p>
<p>“Do you remember that first night you came with me for homa?” “Of course.&quot; “Do you remember what we did with the cow dung?”</p>
<p>It took me a moment, but then it came to me: “We took some cow dung, mixed it in water, put it in a pan, and then balanced a pestle upright in it.”</p>
<p>&ldquo;And that pestle remained upright as long as the eclipse continued. As soon as the eclipse ended it fell, automatically. You saw it; how do you explain it? How will scientists explain it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have no idea.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We explain it on the basis of the strange gravitational effects that eclipses cause. Eclipses are excellent for people like you and me because their gravi tational effects multiply the effect of our sadhana. If you do one hundred repetitions of your mantra during an eclipse it is like doing one hundred thousand repetitions on an ordinary day. If you offer one oblation into the fire it is like a thousand oblations. And nothing beats this time for offering prayers and performing rites for your deceased ancestors.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course any time period which is this powerful can have negative effects also, so some precautions are in order. Never look at an eclipse; the rays have a very disturbing effect on the mind. A pregnant woman should not even go outside during an eclipse, lest her child be affected. Take noth ing internally, not even water, while the eclipse is going on, and for as long as possible, up to twelve hours, before and after. If you can follow this niyama you can make any eclipse work for you.”</p>
<p>He had told me all this before. I waited patiently for him to get to his point.</p>
<p>“Eclipses happen irregularly, of course; you cannot rely on them. Fortu nately, though, predictable moments for enhanced sadhana occur every year, in every season. India is such a wonderful place that even our festivals occur at those times when success at specific forms of worship will be easi est. The Rishis systematized these festivals in order to help sadhakas become clairaudient and clairvoyant.</p>
<p>( 1641</p>
<p>TANTRA</p>
<p>For example, Ma, the Great Goddess, is worshipped during three periods of Nine Nights during the year because during those periods it is easiest to come into contact with Her.</p>
<p>“The Rishis, who created the universe, are well aware of the effects of the various Yugas on our minds. They also knew that these doctrines that we have been talking about are far too complex and subtle for the average indi vidual, so they created seasonal festivals. When the common folk celebrate these festivals their minds become somewhat detached from the mundane and attached to the spiritual, while those who know the esoteric signifi cance of the festivals use them to spur their spiritual progress.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The festival season in the fall begins with Shravana, the month in which Shiva is worshipped, during which Krishna is born. Then comes the Gane sha festival, followed by the fortnight during which the ancestors are pla cated. Once both Ganesha and the ancestors are happy Kundalini can be safely raised, which happens during Nava Ratri, the Nine Nights which are sacred to the Goddess. Finally, we have Dipavali, the Festival of Lights, sacred to Vishnu in the form of Krishna, when each vertebra of the spinal column becomes a point of intense, pure light.</p>
<p>“The spring festival season is similar: it begins with Ganesha&rsquo;s birthday, followed by Maha Shiva Ratri, which is as you know the most important night of the year for Shiva worship. A fortnight later comes Hutashani, or Holi, a harvest festival which commemorates the burning of the demoness Holika, and after another fortnight another Nava Ratri begins, which culmi nates in the birth of Vishnu in the form of Rama. The birthday of Anjaneya, the monkey god who is an incarnation of Shiva, follows six days later.</p>
<p>“During these various festivals there are four important nights (ratri) which are ideal for ritualists like me because they are meant for specific practices. The first is Maha Ratri, the Great Night, which is Maha Shiva Ratri; it falls each year on the night before the new moon during the lunar month of Magha (February or March). The second is Krura Ratri, the Cruel Night, which is Holi, the next full moon after Maha Ratri. Then comes Moha Ratri, the Night of Delusion, which is Krishna&rsquo;s birth night. Krishna deluded everyone with His Maya! It falls in the month of Shravana, usually during August. The last is Kala Ratri, the Black Night, the night just before Dipavali, the new moon of the month of Ashvin. Dipavali occurs in October or November.</p>
<p>“On Maha Ratri people try to stay awake all night long, because it is said that Shiva will come, just for a moment, to anyone who does not sleep at all. But Shiva is too clever for us mortals, and almost everyone who tries this</p>
<p>( 165 )</p>
<p>AGHORA II: Kundalini</p>
<p>nods off for at least a minute or two just at the moment when Shiva is near them. He has to test those who want to see Him, doesn&rsquo;t He?&rdquo;</p>
<p>“I suppose so.&rdquo; I had already tried this a few times, and had dozed off, as predicted, for a few moments each time.</p>
<p>“Krura Ratri commemorates the burning to death of the demoness Holika by her nephew Prahlada. Holika possessed a magic cloak which would incinerate anyone who wore it. Her brother Hiranyakashipu, Prahlada&rsquo;s father, ordered her to kill Prahlada by throwing the cloak over his shoulders. When Holika took Prahlada on her lap he realized what she was going to do and slipped out from under the cape as she unfurled it. The cape fell on her and burned her alive.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It took great power to destroy Holika, and that sort of power is obtained most easily at this time of year. Krura Ratri is useless for anything auspi cious, but it is excellent for practitioners of black magic, especially the Shat Prayoga, the Six Rituals which cause death, delusion, discord, hatred, obstruction, and enchantment.</p>
<p>“Moha Ratri is meant for worship of Krishna, and Kala Ratri is best for sadhanas meant for obtaining control over spirits. A number of things can be accomplished on that day, like Munda Sadhana.”</p>
<p>Munda means “skull.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You require five human skulls for Munda Sadhana. Four are placed in the comers of a square and one in che middle. In between each pair of human skulls you put the skull of an animal. Which animals you use depends on the specific ritual you are doing and the result you want to obtain. When all the skulls have been properly placed and aligned in the proper direction you cover the whole thing carefully and sit on top of it. Then you begin your japa. Do not try this on your own! When I want you to do Munda Sadhana I will tell you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Though Munda Sadhana interested me, I knew it would be useless to try to press him for details and so another question formed in my mind. Vimalananda answered it before I could speak.</p>
<p>“You have more than once asked me why, if Tantra is such a wonderful thing, the Six Rituals exist at all. This is a good question that has more than one answer. One reason they exist is to protect society. A priest has the responsibility to help defend the kingdom in which he lives, and these Six Rituals can be used to kill enemies of the state, to sow discord among foes, or to entice wavering rulers into alliances. They thus become agents of pol icy. They are also used in romance, business, and so on, but with less justi fication.</p>
<p>(166)</p>
<p>TANTRA</p>
<p>The Panchamamsa Sacrament Central to many tantric texts are the rites of Panchamamsa&ndash;the five M&rsquo;s, and the Panchamamsa—the five great spiced meats. Since these passages in the tantras are written in symbolic &ldquo;twilight” language they present several layers of outer, inner and secret meaning. The drawing shows the homa rite of the five great meats which are compounded to produce pills that confer various siddhis. The drawing shows the five meats of a man, cow, elephant, horse and dog, boiling in a Brahmin&rsquo;s skull with the five ambrosias of fat, faeces, urine, blood and semen. The skull rests upon a firepit of human heads above a downward pointing triangular fire mandala and an upward pointing wind mandala. The rite of Panchamamsa has a direct resonance with the practice of Munda Sadhana.</p>
<p>“More important than any political use, however, is their use in sadhana. Suppose you want to make use of enchantment. If you perform the pre scribed ritual correctly, the first effect will be that all the women in your</p>
<p>[167]</p>
<p>AGHORA II: Kundalini</p>
<p>neighborhood will begin to find you irresistably attractive.&rdquo; I had read about this; one text says, in fact, that they will rush to you ‘oozing copiously from their swelling, dangling vaginal lips,&rsquo; meaning that the desire created in them by this ritual will completely overcome their modesty and discrimina</p>
<p>tion</p>
<p>“So,&rdquo; I interrupted, “this is some sort of super-duper aphrodisiac?”</p>
<p>“No; it is not essential that women become sexually excited when they are exposed to this effect; but because most people strongly self-identify with the body most women will inevitably experience this attraction sexu</p>
<p>ally.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Attracting the women is not so difficult; the difficult part comes after they have been enchanted. If your mind is firm you will not be tempted at all by these excited women; you will continue with your ritual, knowing that you are making progress. Soon the enticement will extend to other female beings, especially those in the ethereal realms. If you can resist all the temp tations they will offer, then you will eventually attract the attention of a female deity. If you are sure of yourself you may request Her to teach you like a Bhairavi; if not, you should regard Her as a mother and not permit sex to have anything to do with the relationship. Then you are made.</p>
<p>Wow.</p>
<p>“So I think you will agree that the Six Rituals can be quite useful.” Indeed I did. “Enticement is certainly one way to achieve; but in my experience it is not as good a way as pure, selfless love. It is not easy to preserve your bal ance of mind when a passionate Yakshini (demigoddess) or Naga Kanya (ser pent princess) entwines herself around your body; but there is no danger of falling when you can say to God, honestly, &lsquo;Make me an ugly prostitute for thousands of births, if you want to, but always keep me near You.&rsquo; When you can honestly say this, you are ready to become a true devotee.</p>
<p>“You must begin all sadhana with niyama, but you do not have to practice niyama forever. There will come a time when you will be so absorbed that you will remember the deity at all times. At that stage you won&rsquo;t be able to remember how many repetitions of your mantra you are doing, much less any niyama. Finally you&rsquo;ll forget even to repeat the mantra. But that is a much higher stage.</p>
<p>“Hazrat Bulleh Shah, who eventually became a great saint, was very con scientious early in his career about following a strict niyama, and about keeping track of how much japa he would do. He counted his japa one by one on his japamala (rosary) until one day he overheard the milkmaid who brought him his milk talking to her best friend.</p>
<p>( 168 )</p>
<p>TANTRA</p>
<p>&ldquo;The milkmaid was in the habit of giving milk away free to her lover, and the friend asked her, ‘Don&rsquo;t you keep track of how much milk he is drink ing? How else can you know how much he is eating into your profits?&rsquo;</p>
<p>“The milkmaid replied, &lsquo;Can there be any acccounting in love? My profit is the love he gives me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hazrat Bulleh Shah sat stock still when he heard this. Then he looked at his rosary and thought, &lsquo;This milkmaid has taught me something today. If I really love God, can I do any kind of accounting with Him? What a fool I&rsquo;ve been!&rsquo; He threw the rosary away at once, and never used one again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the beginning a rosary is useful, and strict attention to time is essen tial. Once you become devoted, however, limitations lose their meaning; in devotion, just as in romance, there is no such thing as the limitation of time or space. If you can remember what time it is, you have no capacity for</p>
<p>love.&rdquo;</p>
