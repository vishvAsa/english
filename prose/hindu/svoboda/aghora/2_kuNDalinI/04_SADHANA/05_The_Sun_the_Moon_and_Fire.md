During the afternoons Vimalananda's conversation usually revolved around the racecourse, since most of the people who dropped by to see him at that time were interested in the hot tips which are the sustenance of those who gamble on horses. Those who were more interested in hearing him dis cuss spirituality would come in the evenings, when he would relax and let his mind focus on Reality. One night, after overhearing a couple of his spiri tual “children" speaking knowingly of “devotion” and “knowledge,” he felt a need to put the record straight: 

"In sadhana, either there can be ‘my wish'or there can be ‘Thy wish.' If ‘my wish' exists I follow the path of jnana, trying to become a jnani; if only 'Thy wish' exists I follow the path of bhakti (devotion), aiming to become a bhakta, a devotee. These are the only two possibilities. 'Our' wish cannot exist, because then duality is present. Duality is something in between, nei ther here nor there, and 'in between' is of no use in spirituality. You should either be 'here' or 'there.' If you are ‘here,' worshipping the divine in your own being, then you are a jnani, and your wish exists. If you are 'there,' you worship an external form of the divine, and you are a bhakta. There is no third way. 

"On the path of jnana the guru helps the disciple take out his astral body while his physical body is still alive. It hurts the disciple a little, because his astral body has completely forgotten its true nature. It self-identifies so com pletely with the physical body that it is hard to make it split off. But when it is finally done the disciple knows that it was worth it, because now he can enter his own causal body and choose the karmas he wants to pay off at his own pace on his own terms. All he has to do now is follow the adesha (com 

(128)

mands, instructions) of the internal guru. Adesha means Adya Isha, the First Deity, the internal voice which tells the disciple what to do when. 

"On the path of bhakti the guru arranges everything, and the disciple's only job is to maintain continuous devotion." 

"Which is better?" asked a listener who came infrequently to Vimalanan da's den. 

"There is no better or worse; it depends entirely on the sadhaka and the guru. The result is the same. Once ]naneshwar Maharaj was traveling on a pilgrimage with a group of other saints. It was very hot that day, and they were all thirsty. The only well they could find had no bucket. How to get the water? 

"First Jnaneshwar's brother Nivritti Nath, who had taught Jnaneshwar the path of jnana, used his yogic powers to go down himself into the well and bring up water. Next Namdev, who had taught Jnaneshwar the path of bhakti, started to sing a song in praise of the Lord. His devotion was so pro found that every living being in the neighborhood, even the trees and plants, became filled with the love of God. Soon even the water of the well began to overflow its rim out of sheer joy at hearing Namdev sing God's praises. Then Jnaneshwar realized that he had seen the end result of both the paths of knowledge and devotion, and he asked his beloved deity Vit thala for permission to leave his body, because there was nothing left for him to see in the world.” 

Silence descended for a moment as we all contemplated that scene, and then Vimalananda continued: 

"Let's think about it in terms of the subtle body, the nadis and Kundalini. Bhakti and jnana are the two roads to the Ajna Chakra. Whoever follows the path of jnana must concentrate on the sun. The ancient Vedics all followed jnana, and they were all basically sun worshippers. What happens to a man who looks into the sun? He becomes blind; literally blind, if he looks liter ally at the sun, and blind to the world if he stares at the Sun of Jnana. When you become blind to all differentiation, all name and form, you can see nothing which is not the One Reality. A sun worshipper follows the Ganga, which here represents the right nostril, the Surya Nadi. 

“The man who follows the path of bhakti uses in his rituals the left nos tril, the Yamuna, which represents the moon. This takes a little longer than the path of jnana, and even in the external world the Yamuna River is longer than the Ganga; it meanders, whereas the Ganga is direct. Yama, the Mes senger of Death Himself, who happens to be the brother of the river Yamuna, says that if one takes a bath in the Yamuna on Bhau Bija (Brother's 

[129] 

AGHORA II: Kundalini 

Day), then all one's karmas are washed away. So people flock to bathe in the Yamuna on that day, but they are fools. What Yama means is the Yamuna of the body, the left nostril.” 

After pausing briefly to let us gnaw on the idea of bathing oneself in a nadi, he shifted his tack: 

"Of course, for a man to be overcome by bhakti is rare, though it is easy for a woman. A man must develop a waxen heart, a secret, internal love. What happens to someone who stares at luna, the moon? Lunacy, madness. When you achieve Maha Bhava Samadhi, emotional highlights, you go mad, mad with uncontrollable love and joy. The moon stands for the mind, and is cool. You get a delicious coolness and lunacy from the moon. It is this sweet madness that makes falling in love so wonderful. The sun also loves you, but the sun is so intense that it burns you to a crisp, without any interval of loveplay in between. The sun teaches you selflessness. Selfishness is your worst enemy, true, but without at least some selfishness there is no love. 

“Rama, Perfection Encompassed (Maryada Purushottama), is of the solar race; His way is the way of penance. Krishna, Perfection Personified (Purnat maka Purushottama), is of the lunar race; He loves to play hide-and-seek with His devotees, never letting them catch Him until the very end. The moon gets its light from the sun, but you can't look at the sun; you'll go blind. You can look at the moon, but you'll go mad. The choice is yours. 

“Which is better therefore depends on you. But remember, if you choose to follow the path of jnana you will be using Surya Nadi, which will heat you up. The path of knowledge is dangerous nowadays because there are so many temptations. If your physical appetites are even slightly stimulated, it becomes most difficult to control them. So many good yogis have gone to the West and ruined themselves. They had good intentions, but did not realize, or perhaps forgot, that a yogi cannot be a bhogi (an enjoyer of sense pleasures) at the same time. Bhakti is much safer than jnana, because you use Chandra Nadi, which keeps you cool. It takes longer, but there is no danger of falling. 

“It is because of these dangers on the path of jnana that Brahmanas, the priestly class, are supposed to wear their sacred thread, which is called a jah navi, or yajnopavita. Jahnavi is also a name for the Ganga, which refers here to the internal Ganga, the Surya Nadi. The purpose of this sacred thread is to control and enhance the functioning of this 'sun channel,' which helps in the study of the Veda; the Veda is the path of jnana, and Brahmanas are sup posed to be ‘knowers of the Absolute.' 

“I see that you are wearing a jahnavi," said Vimalananda to his visitor. "Do 

(1301SADHANA 

you know its significance?" 

The man folded his hands in the universal Indian gesture of respect, and replied, in English, “Sir, I was born a Brahmana, and I have wom this for many years, but no one has ever explained it to me to my satisfaction. I hope you will please do so." 

“Please don't call me 'sir'; I have not been knighted by the queen,” said Vimalananda, also in English, laughing. “The jahnavi is always worn from the left shoulder down to the right waist, except when certain rituals like Pitri Tarpana (ancestor worship) are performed when it is worn opposite (right shoulder to left waist). Great people like kings, princes and generals usually wear their swords, bandoliers or sashes left to right as well. A sash creates both a mental and physical sense of command; a jahnavi creates a spiritual sense of command, which is necessary for the path of jnana. This is its effect on the mind. 

"A true jahnavi is handwoven of raw cotton, not wool or silk, since these materials have a different electrical potential. It has three strands of thread, with three peculiar knots added. Very few people today know why this is so. It has to do with the body's three most important nadis and with the three principal knots which must be pierced if Kundalini is ever to be fully awak ened. 

“What specifically does a jahnavi do to the physical body? Well, it cer tainly makes the right, or masculine, side of the body predominant. By wearing it over the left shoulder it helps a man accumulate and harness shakti. A woman has no need whatsoever to wear a jahnavi, because she is the embodiment of shakti. Unfortunately, I will be that the only time you even think about your jahnavi is when you gather it up and drape it around your right ear whenever you go to the toilet. Am I right?" 

The man nodded, sheepishly and vigorously. 

“This is necessary because of its connection with Apana, the downward moving form of the body's shakti. What connection? We'll have to discuss that later. 

“Back in the Vedic era the jahnavi was an integral part of sadhana. When a boy was ready to begin studying with a guru he would, on an auspicious day, undergo the Upanayana ceremony, the initiation into Vedic studies dur ing which boys first put on a jahnavi. First he would strip naked and have his head shaved, and then he would appear before his guru, who would show him how to tie his loincloth, which was one long piece of cloth, not the sewn thing that people use today. It had to be properly tied so that it would press on a certain vertebra, and thus stimulate certain nadis. This sig 

[131] 

AGHORA II: Kundalini 

nified the beginning of the period of the boy's life during which he would be a celibate student. Celibate, to prevent Kundalini from getting stuck in the sex center. 

"Then the boy would do a full prostration to the guru, who would touch the boy's head and bless him. While holding the boy's head the guru would use phrenology to check out which parts of the brain were most fully devel oped, to determine which branch of knowledge the boy should pursue. A well-developed occiput would indicate a talent for mathematics, and so on. 

"This was an opportune moment to test the boy's other capabilities as well. Suppose the guru wanted to know whether or not the boy could suc ceed at alchemy. He would pour mercury into the palm of the boy's hand, and tell him to pour it back into the bottle without spilling a drop. If he could do this, he was fit. He would be able to do this only if he had one long, straight line running across his palm, so this is a form of palmistry. Since the lines on the palm are created by certain genes, examination of the palm means examination of the genes. And since the genes are closely related to an individual's karmas, we will have a good idea of what will hap pen to him in the future. 

"When the guru had decided what the boy was fit to study he would ini tiate him into that version of the Gayatri Mantra which was most suitable for him, and would make him wear the jahnavi. Then the boy's parents would beg for him to return home. If he really wanted to succeed, he would ignore them and stay with the guru. Those others, who did it only for show everyone nowadays, since no one knows the process—would return with their parents, and in the course of time would forget the mantra and remove the loincloth. Then what would be the use of their continuing to wear the jahnavi? 

“Many people wear jahnavis today, but most never know what they are meant for. How can you be a knower, a jnani, if you don't know anything about what you are practicing? No, it is always better today to follow the path of devotion."
