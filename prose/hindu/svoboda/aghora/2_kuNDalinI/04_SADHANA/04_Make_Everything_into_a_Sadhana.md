“But I know you have said before that you don't have to renounce every thing in order to achieve." 

“No, you don't; but you do have to make everything into a sadhana. Offer every morsel of food to your deity; go to sleep at night remembering your deity. And as for sex, you don't need to know any complicated sexual rituals in order to offer a mantra with each stroke of the penis into the fire of the vagina. Always offer whatever you do to your deity, and He or she will always take care of you. However, how easy is it to remember to offer a man tra with each stroke of your penis once your sexual embrace becomes really intense? This is why I say that the more potential addictions you remove the faster will be your progress.” 

"From what I have learned, food at least has the potential to produce Sat tva, sleep definitely creates Tamas, and sex generates tremendous Rajas,” I added. 

“And what I have leamed is that any substance or activity can produce any of the Three Gunas, depending on how well you digest it. In the beginning you have to accumulate Sattva; this much is clear. When your conscious ness is full of Sattva your power of discrimination becomes predominant, so you can judge easily what is good or bad for you. If you allow excess Rajas or Tamas to collect in your consciousness either your ego will run amok, or you will become a slave to your senses, or both. 

“In the Sattvic Tantras you are given a mantra along with a description of its visual form for meditation. With that mental image you construct the deity in your astral body, and eventually that deity projects and shows Him self or Herself to you. Visualization is essential because of the primacy of the eyes. Not everyone is fit to visualize, but if you are you will eventually per ceive the deity right before your eyes. What you will see is not the real deity; it is your own creation, from your own astral body. Do you know the Bimba Pratibimba Nyaya?". 

Let's see... "the Law of Image and Reflection?" 

“Yes. When the moon rises over a still pond you see a perfect reflection of it on the water. It looks like the moon but is not. What you create within you by Tantric sadhana is only a reflection of the image you have of your deity. But since you have given that image all the powers of the deity that reflection can do your work for you, and eventually it will lead you to the real deity. This is the sure way; it takes a little time.

SADHANA 

"In Aghora, which is purely Tamasic, you do not bother with sweetly inviting the deity to come to you. You demand that God come, and you catch God by the hair and drag Him or Her if necessary. Aghoris use intoxi cants and other sorts of aids because they want a quick blitzkrieg process. But this results in excessive Rajas and Tamas, and if you make even the slightest miscue down you go, dive bombing. And do you think that God likes to be dragged by the hair? God will say, 'OK, if this guy thinks he is so great, let us see what happens when I give him a taste of his own medicine.' And then you had better be ready to endure God's Tamasic play, which is no joke. Aghora and Tantra are dangerous things to fool about with.” 

"So I should be patient,” I said with a twinge of bitterness. 

"You have to be patient. My case was different, I admit; quite different from most. I never intended anything to occur; from the beginning of my spiritual career until now I have never requested any specific sadhana from anyone. Jina Chandra Suri tricked me into sitting on that corpse (see Aghora), but had he not done so I would never have realized Ma so quickly. I have always had faith that Ma will teach me what I need to know, and so She has. Faith is the key, and the best way to gain faith is to repeat the sweet name of God, and turn your entire existence over to God. This is the essence of sadhana. 

"One reason you will have to be patient is that deities don't like to come to you if They can avoid it. They are more like animals in that way. In the for est, will a deer come to you immediately, even if you call it with love? No, because deep down is the fear that one day you will come and catch its throat. Similarly, the deity is afraid that if He comes near you you will catch Him and give Him work to do. To overcome this fear you must know the likes and dislikes of your particular deity. You must offer Him that which He craves; then how will He be able to hold out? Deities love to play about, and may try some stunts on you in return. If you don't allow anything to affect you, you'll be OK. If you waver or fumble then you've had it. 

“Deities are very simple, really; They're a lot like children. When They love you They love you without any restraint; but if you cheat or harass Them They'll never forget it. If you really want to become close to your deity, you have to become just like a little child. Remember the words of Jesus: 'Unless you become like a little child you will not be able to enter the Kingdom of Heaven.' 

“You have to be able to say to your deity, in all sincerity, I'm so lonely; I don't have any other playmates. Please come and play with me.' But let me tell you, it is extremely difficult to forget your position and ego and what

have-you and become a child again. It takes years and years of hard work to reach this stage, the stage when you can say to your Beloved without an iota of cunning or craftiness, ‘Look, I have this chocolate; if You will come to me I'll give it to you.' A child doesn't know how to bribe, so it's permissible. But you know, and you have to forget." 

"And so one of the names for Shiva is Smarahara, “the Killer of Memory.'” 

“Yes. Only He can erase all your memories of who you are, which is how He kills you; He makes your Kundalini love Him so much that She forgets in that instant to self-identify with you.” 

“And if you do this willfully in sadhana--if you ‘die while still alive - then She can be made to identify with a new personality.” 

“Yes. One of the reasons saints love to remain in solitude is that they need time away from other humans to enable them to forget themselves. You know that to achieve success at Tantra you need strong virility; you must be powerful to perform sadhana. The more sadhana you do the more ojas you will create. Do I need to tell you what ojas is?” 

“No." Ojas is an Ayurvedic concept; it is that essence of physical energy which produces your aura and your immunity to invasion by diseases or other unwelcome visitors. 

"When you have plenty of ojas your aura becomes tremendously enhanced, which will attract plenty of people to you who will come and bother you. This happened to Ramakrishna Paramahamsa at one point. He actually had to ask Bhavatarini Ma to make him outwardly normal again, and to make him ‘inwardly attractive' instead. Because he preserved all his ojas inside he was able to perfectly self-identify with Her; he dissolved into Her. 

"Once you reach a certain stage in your love for God all you will be able to do is love, and you won't be able to express your love in words even if you want to. This sometimes happens between humans, too, if they really love one another. It can also be true of animals, which is why I like dogs. Dogs have pure, unselfish love for their masters, which is why I would like to become God's dog, totally devoted to Him alone." 

Vimalananda's dog, Lizoo, an astute canine, overheard us discussing dogs, and jumped into his lap, as if to say, “And I am your dog, totally devoted to you!" 

He petted her tenderly. “People frequently come and tell me, “I am getting less and less peace the more I repeat my mantra.' Whenever troubles increase like that during sadhana you can be sure that you are getting closer to your deity. You cannot realize your deity until your consciousness

becomes clear and clean, for which you have to burn off all your bad kar mas. As you become firmer in your sadhana, more and more of your bad karmas from this life and from thousands of previous lives are liberated from your causal body. You are bound to be affected by this—everyone likes to spend, and no one likes to pay the bills—but don't let that stop you. Con tinue on, continue until you achieve; then you will understand that it was 100% worth it. 

“This is Kali Yuga, though, and as soon as most people start getting this negative effect from the removal of their bad karmas they think that it is somehow the fault of the mantra and they quit their practice altogether, just at the point they should be doing it more vigorously. Is it any surprise that they never get any result from their sadhana?" 

“It is no surprise," I echoed sardonically. 

"There was once a man who did penance of Lord Shiva for one hundred years without every having any personal experience of Him. As this fellow lay dying he thought to himself, 'What is this? Is all my penance for noth ing?' He should have remembered that just as matter is indestructible all action must bear its fruit; it is only a question of time. Time exists only for us mortals, not for the immortals. Nature's wheels turn very slowly, like those of the steam roller, but like the steam roller Nature crushes everything in Her path. 

“The man was reborn as a bee. He forgot the mantra he was repeating, he forgot his ritual, he forgot everything, but at the back of his mind was the lingering tendency to worship Shiva; at least that much carried over from his previous life. 

"It was probably this lingering tendency which led the bee to fly one day to Benaras, Shiva's chief city. He reached the garden of a merchant, and see ing the beautiful lotuses there began to suck their nectar. He had forgotten all about Shiva and everything else; he was thinking only of nectar. He became so drunk on nectar that he didn't notice that night fell and the lotuses closed while he was inside one of them. He was trapped. What to do? He had to wait until morning to escape. 

“Next moming before dawn the merchant went out into his garden, cut the lotus that held the bee, took it into his worship-room, said, 'Bhole!' and put the lotus atop his image of Shiva. 

“When the sun rose its rays fell onto the lotus, which opened and allowed the bee to exit. Lord Shiva, who knows past, present and future, said to Himself, 'Wah, wah! Here is a man who worships me and does penance for a hundred years and then dies and comes back as a bee to sit on my head! 

[127]

Varam bruhi! (Ask for a boon!' 

"The bee said, 'What “varam bruhi!” now? That would have been useful when I was a man. Now make me like you are.' And immediately he became just like Shiva. In fact, he became one of Shiva's close attendants, an immor 

tal.” 

At this point Lizoo jumped up and began to lick Vimalananda's face insis tently, demanding immediate attention and so ending the conversation. This struck me as a sort of omen, a confirmation of all that Vimalananda had been saying, a reinforcement of his lesson.
