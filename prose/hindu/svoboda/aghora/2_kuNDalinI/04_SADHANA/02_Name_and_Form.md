Every month or two, when the mood possessed him, Vimalananda would take me and Roshni with him to the Lakshmi-Narayana temple in Central Bombay, to look upon the face of God. The images in this temple are carved from pure white marble, and their sweetness and sublimity effortlessly pierce the hearts of those who gaze at them in faith. All the humans there the temple trustees, the priests, the watchmen--knew Vimalananda, and all were happy to see him arrive, all except the musicians, who were envious of his superior musical abilities. After making our offerings Vimalananda

would sit down at the harmonium to play and sing for Narayana and Lakshmi. The sound of his voice, the incense's soft burning, and the transcendent equanimity permanently etched on the faces of the Lord and His Lady filled the hall with the palpable sweet ache of a devotee for his Beloved. 

After one of these musicales, when we had returned home and I had poured a glass of Scotch for Vimalananda, he began to talk, tears glistening now and again in his eyes as emotion welled up and spilled over the banks of his everyday personality: 

“Did you see how Narayana was dressed tonight? So beau-tiful! You know, you have the choice of worshipping God as a Formless Absolute or of wor shipping God with form, and I have always recommended to everyone that they worship God with form. We are all human beings; God is supposed to have made us in His image; why not then make God in our image? It is so much easier to worship a God with a human form. Can you comprehend the immensity of the totality of the billions of universes? No, n-o. But you may be able to comprehend the compassionate eyes of Jesus, or the bewitching eyes of Krishna. 

“There are so many different types of eyes in the world. Some are entranc ing, some cruel and calculating, some innocent, some lifeless. But there have never been any eyes like the eyes of Krishna and Jesus. Their eyes make you go mad when you see them, mad with love. Krishna's eyes are bewitch ing; they are so full of sweetness that they turn you into a lunatic. And Jesus' eyes? His eyes are brimming over with divine compassion. Oh, my God! When I think of the eyes of Jesus I think of His chest. So broad it must have been, to gather everyone in to it and take over all their karmas--to be able to say, 'Come unto me.'" 

“Something that I have been thinking about lately,” I began hesitantly, averse to disturbing his mood, “is the fact that I was born and brought up a Christian, and now here I am involved in Aghora. I know that you are a great devotee of Jesus, but isn't there some contradiction in there somewhere?" 

"Well, have you forgotten Jesus? Do you still love Him?” Vimalananda inquired gendly. 

“Yes, I do," I replied. 

"Good. Because if you had told me otherwise, I would have told you to get out!” He smiled. “What is a deity after all? A deity is the One Conscious ness expressed in a particular way, a certain aspect of reality which has a spe cific form. All deities are therefore limited to some degree. Jesus was a great being, but even He had some limitations. So did Rama and Krishna, so does

Shiva; any being that has a name and a form is limited, if only by that name and form." 

“Doesn't Advaita Vedanta teach," I had to ask, "that while the Absolute is true, the Relative, which is the Manifested Universe of name and form, is inherently false, and so one should only worship the Highest?" 

"Who says so?" he thundered. “Only one version of Advaita Vedanta teaches that, the version that Shankaracharya propagated. Other versions of Advaita Vedanta are not so limited. But it is true that the Highest is beyond all name and form, which is why I believe it is better not to worship the dei ties at all." 

I tossed a confused look at him. He enjoyed catching me off guard; once a wrestler, always a wrestler. 

“I believe that it is better to worship the One behind the deities, and to respect and appreciate the deities for how well they play the roles assigned to them. Do you see what I mean? There is a subtle difference. You love the deities, but you worship the Absolute that created Them and dwells within Them. Worship of a deity is a good way to get started on the spiritual path for so many reasons, but mainly because it is easier to love a form than it is to love the Formless. You may not choose to visualize the Universal Reality as Shiva; maybe you prefer Krishna, or Jesus. It doesn't matter; you will achieve God in whatever form you imagine Him or Her to be, so long as you worship with sincerity and love." 

"So it is only when you distinguish one deity from another as if they were really different that there is a contradiction?" 

“Exactly. You have worshipped Jesus since you were born. Can you forget Jesus now, even if you wanted to? Never! Jesus will never let go of your hand, even if you try to flee from Him; that is the depth of His compassion for you. But neither will He interfere, nor will He be upset, if you also want to worship God in another form. Jesus cares nothing for form; He cares only for pure love. 

“You began by worshipping Jesus, and you must continue to worship Jesus. However, you personally can make faster progress if you perform cer tain Aghora sadhanas, because you have negative traits in your personality which need to be removed.” 

“This is like fighting fire with fire, I suppose? Using harsh measures to eliminate my own harshness?" 

He nodded agreement as he sipped his drink. “You know, today's false swamis and other so-called experts go on and on about Satya Yuga, 'the Golden Age,' and Kali Yuga, 'the Iron Age.' Why can't they explain it 

[117] 

AGHORA II: Kundalini 

directly without beating around the bush so much?” He was rapidly warm ing to his subject. 

"It is just the difference between a gold sword and an iron sword. Both are used to cut through the Ashta Pasha, the Eight Snares which bind us to the world: lust, anger, greed, delusion, envy, shame, fear and disgust. A gold sword does not cut very well. Get into a swordfight with a gold sword and you'll soon see what I mean.” We chuckled together over that image. “Peo ple in the Golden Age couldn't be good killers; they believed in mandana, not khandana. They believed that you should remove the Ashta Pasha by creating beneficial new samskaras (personality characteristics), which after taking root in the individual would eventually crowd out all his or her limi tations. 

"In Kali Yuga people believe in khandana. An iron sword will cut you very well, and aren't most people today killers? Either you become a killer or you get killed in today's world. The word pashu means 'he who is snared by a pasha.' Pashu also means an animal. As long as you are in the grips of one of the Eight Snares you are no better, and are probably worse, than an animal. 

“All of us today are pashus, animals meant for sacrifice, trapped by the Eight Snares. The best way to get rid of the Ashta Pasha in Kali Yuga is to cut through them with Tantra and Aghora. If you can withstand the pain of hav ing your personality ripped from you, then you can sacrifice yourself, and then when you are dead to the world new samskaras can be created. This is what Aghora is all about.” 

For a fleeting moment I felt sorry for myself, for being so profoundly snared that I could be redeemed only through butchery. 

As usual, he caught my thought. “Do you think that only lechers, meat eaters and drug fiends are animals? Oh, no. The Tantras talk about spiritual pashus, who are just as animalistic as any other pashus but in a different way. Spiritual pashus are sectarian; they slander anyone who doesn't share their beliefs, or who worships a different deity. They are much more con cerned with outer than with inner purity; they like to make a show of their worship. So many of the Brahmanas, the so-called spiritual caste, are the worst sort of pashu. 

"Only a pashu, an animalistic human, will think of the deities as being fundamentally different from one another, and will be willing to kill for one god or another. Muslims have been notorious since the beginning for slaughtering as infidels anyone who did not believe as they do, but what did the Christians do for so many centuries? They fought and killed the Mus lims as infidels, all right, but worse than that, the Protestants and Catholics 

(118)

slaughtered each other mercilessly. And for what? So that each could claim that they had a monopoly over the love of Jesus? Can anything be more ridiculous?" 

“It is still happening even today, in Northern Ireland.” 

“Yes, it is still happening today, and not only among the Christians. Within Islam the Shias and the Sunnis still kill one another. Here in India it is not so bad--people kill each other for other reasons...but Hindus and Muslims still kill one another occasionally. And even among the Hindus some Krishna worshippers will abuse worshippers of Rama, and vice versa, and many worshippers of Vishnu think that worship of Shiva or the God dess is nothing but piffle. 

“All around the world the people who are really spiritual never look at the outer clothing of a person-what language they speak, what god they wor ship. They look only at the inner being. So I say, forget all this foolishness; leave the arguments to the pashus, and you worship God in whatever form you please.” 

"Provided that I know how to do so," I added, fishing for more guidance. “Of course. You need to have at least a basic understanding of the process in order for it to proceed properly. If the blueprint is correct the structure is bound to be correct; that is my principle. I believe that the very first step in spirituality is to forget to merge your consciousness with external things. To keep aloof from the world, and especially from this sort of sectarianism, is to get closer to your deity. So long as you are attached to the world you are detached from God. Once you become attached to God it is inevitable that you will become detached from the world. 

"Someone once told me that Rodin's famous sculpture The Thinker was a good example of detachment. I told him, 'The Thinker is simply thinking. He has not gone so far into himself that he has become absolutely lost. If he had, there would be no need for him to be making such an effort to think. It is obvious that he is still stuck in his senses. In fact, I think he looks very much like a gorilla.'” 

We chuckled again, and Vimalananda's tone intensified. 

"Thinking about your limitations is no way to change them; in fact, if you think about them very much you will most likely reinforce them. This is why I have little use for most psychologists. They spend all their time mak ing their patients remember all the bad things that happened to them, and never try to erase those bad memories and replace them with good sam skaras, which is what you do when you visualize a deity.” 

“Freud once said, 'Neurosis is reminiscence."" 

[119] 

AGHORA II: Kundalini 

"Unfortunately Freud himself was a neurotic; otherwise he would never have come up with some of the bull that he tried to pass off as knowledge. He thought he understood sex, but all he understood was sexual abnormal ity, and that not too thoroughly. But that particular saying of his is true: neu rosis happens when you are trapped by your memories into perpetuating your limitations. This is why sadhana is so necessary, especially in Kali Yuga, when everyone has limitations to spare. 

“I believe in the old Indian Law of Caterpillar and Butterfly, the Kita Bhra mari Nyaya. Within the misshapen caterpillar is an image. Perhaps it is not a 

truly mental image, but is only present in the genes and chromosomes; but isn't that also an image? You are splitting hairs if you say it is not, because that image must exist somewhere in the caterpillar's consciousness for it to become a butterfly. It is there, at that rudimentary level, because of the ego. The caterpillar's ego continuously concentrates on its body, just as your ego is continuously self-identifying with your own body and your own personal ity. Otherwise you couldn't exist. 

“But at some point the caterpillar's ego stops self-identifying exclusively with its caterpillar form and begins to self-identify with its butterfly form. It imagines itself to be a butterfly for so long that in the end it becomes a but terfly. Actually it always was a butterfly, and only time and concentration were necessary for cause to reveal itself in effect. Cause is effect concealed; effect is cause revealed. It's the same way with sadhana: Whatever you imag ine you will most surely become. You might not achieve as fast as some do, unless you have already done a lot of sadhana in previous births and you have a powerful guru to initiate you into your mantra in this birth. But even tually you are bound to achieve, if you are patient and persistent. There is no instant payoff in worshipping God." 

“So sadhana is basically just a matter of preventing Kundalini from identi fying with a limited human personality so that She can identify with a cos mic personality?" I was becoming comfortable with the concept. 

“Yes; in fact, if you identify with the new image strongly enough you will even start to look like the deity you worship. I knew a sadhu in Gimnar who was a great devotee of Anjaneya—I like to call Hanuman Anjaneya' because it reminds me of His mother, Anjani. This sadhu concentrated on Anjaneya with such fervor that he actually grew a little tail! There was another who started to drink poison like Shiva does; he eventually became poison-proof! If you repeat “Coca-Cola, Coca-Cola” all the time you may not start to taste Coke, but eventually you will become Coke." 

Hmm-another unusual image that interrupted the usual flow of my 

[120]SADHANA 

mind, as it made me suddenly realize that we have almost as many deities in the West are there are gods and goddesses in India. We have rock and roll stars, sports heroes, movie stars, cartoon characters-all sorts of images to imitate with appropriate mantras and hymns so that we can recreate our selves in their image. Somehow I preferred the images Vimalananda was providing me. 

“Visualization and repetition of mantras reinforce the new image being created within, then,” I said. 

“That's right. All the sacred books tell us that in Kali Yuga the greatest sadhana is to repeat God's name, but why? Always ask why! The reason is because name and form are identical; when you call the name you create the form. Each deity has a name because each name is a mantra, a way of creating the form of that deity. 

“Mantra means ‘man ki tarana': that which saves the mind from the perils of samsara. In Tantra and Aghora we believe in making use of the power of the mind to achieve the goal. Some Yogis say, 'Destroy the mind,' but I say, 'Why destroy something which can be of great use? Control the mind.' You should only destroy something that is dangerous and that you are afraid of, and the only people who are afraid of the mind are those who are not in control of it. So many of these 'yogis' are real hypocrites. 

“Remember the words of John in his gospel: 'In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.' When you repeat God's name you actually create God's form within your conscious ness, which gives your Kundalini Shakti something good to self-identify with. Repetition of the deity's name while visualizing His or Her form is the best sort of worship we have available to us.
