      <description>&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;We would never have had the Ramayana at all had it not been for the Rishi Valmiki and his concern over how to spread out the karmas he had incurred through his chosen profession. Valmiki was not born a Rishi; in fact, he was a bandit. His job was waylaying people and robbing them. Sometimes he would hold them for ransom, or even kill them. Occasionally he would let them go. One day Valmiki caught the celestial troublemaker Narada, and told him that he would have to die because he had nothing of value to steal.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;â€œRama, the Indwelling Spirit, is called Raja (King) Rama because He is king of the seventy-two thousand nadis. Krishna also rules the nadis, but His Lila is different; He has a love affair with them. Some people find it eas ier to relate to the Soul as King; others prefer to relate to It as Lover. You must find which way agrees best with your temperament, and relate in that way. As they say, &amp;rsquo;the Truth is One; the learned describe It in many ways.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Vimalananda paused for a moment and looked up to an image of Anjaneya, better known as Hanuman. His lip quivered almost imperceptibly with emotion as he spoke again.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Anjaneya flew to Lanka, located Sita, and assured her that Rama was coming to rescue her. Before returning to Rama with the news of Sita&amp;rsquo;s whereabouts Anjaneya allowed himself to be captured and taken before Ravana to make Ravana aware of the gravity of what he had done. Then Anjaneya burned the city of Lanka to the ground, destroying Ravana&amp;rsquo;s lovely fantasy world.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
