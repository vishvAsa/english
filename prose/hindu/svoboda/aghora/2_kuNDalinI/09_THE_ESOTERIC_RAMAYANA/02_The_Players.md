“Rama, the Indwelling Spirit, is called Raja (King) Rama because He is king of the seventy-two thousand nadis. Krishna also rules the nadis, but His Lila is different; He has a love affair with them. Some people find it eas ier to relate to the Soul as King; others prefer to relate to It as Lover. You must find which way agrees best with your temperament, and relate in that way. As they say, 'the Truth is One; the learned describe It in many ways. 

“Rama's brother Lakshmana represents the power of concentration which helps the Soul to regain its Bride. His name, from the word laksha, suggests one-pointed concentration, and in fact Lakshmana did focus his concentration on a single goal: his brother Rama, the individual soul. Sita, Rama's wife, is the Kundalini Shakti, the power of Ma on an individual level. Sita was not born from a womb, as Rama was; she was found when her father King Janaka was plowing the ground to build a sacrificial altar. She comes therefore from Bhu Garbha, the 'womb of the earth.' Janaka means 'creator'; it is Janaka who by removing Sita from the Earth Element creates' her, or if you prefer, ‘awakens' her.” 

“Awakens' seems more appropriate, since the Earth Element is at the Muladhara Chakra.” 

"Exactly. Janaka, Sita's father, the king of Videha, was a truly amazing man. He had so purified the Fire Element within him that he used to sit on the throne with one foot resting in a blazing fire--not near it, in it-and with one of his queens sitting on his left thigh. He would cup her left breast in his hand, and go about the business of kingship without the least distur bance whatever. This is the real significance of the word videha, which means 'bodyless.' Even though Janaka had a body he behaved as if he had none. 

“When Rama came to Janaka's court to attend the Swayamvara Cere mony at which Sita would decide who she would wed, He was given Lord Shiva's bow to bend, which no one had ever been able to bend before. When Rama first bent and then broke the bow, Janaka realized that Rama

was meant to marry Sita. Esoterically-well, this is something which cannot be communicated in words, but I can tell you this: Shiva's bow relates to the medulla oblongata.” 

“The medulla oblongata?" 

“Yes, the ancient Rishis were well aware of anatomy, as you have glimpsed somewhat from your study of Ayurveda. Now, Rama and Sita have to leave for the forest almost immediately after being married. Lakshmana refuses to be separated from them—how can the power of concentration be separated from the soul and the ego?-and accompanies them. When Kundalini unites with the soul the two withdraw from the senses, which wither and die from lack of shakti. And in fact King Dasharatha died very soon after Rama left Ayodhya. Dasharatha means 'Ten Chariots': the ten senses. The senses allow us to become aware of the soul; this is how Dasharatha is Rama's father. 

“All would have been well with Rama and Sita in the jungle had not Sita fallen prey to curiosity and disobeyed the orders of her brother-in-law Lakshmana. Which is precisely what I keep telling you: just because your Kundalini starts to get awakened does not mean that the job is over. In fact, your job is only beginning. Because she strayed from perfect concentration on the soul, Sita was abducted by Ravana. 

“Ravana, the demon king who abducted Sita, represents the limited per sonality which constantly contemplates its greatness: 'I am everything, I am lord of Lanka.' 'Lanka' is Lam Bija, the Earth Element. Ravana was a very powerful being; he had become lord of the manifested universe. His ten heads also stand for the ten sense organs. He propitiates Shiva by chopping off these heads, which means that he forcibly restrained his senses from per ceiving anything except Shiva. His offering is selfish, however; he is a demon. 

"Once he had realized Shiva, Ravana wanted to carry Him down to Lanka to live with him there. But Shiva is above the manifested universe--within the brain—and so when Ravana lifted Mount Kailasa, Shiva's home, in order to carry it and Shiva back with him to Lanka--the Muladhara Chakra- Shiva pressed Ravana down with His toe, and Ravana's hands were trapped under the mountain. Ravana had to bellow hymns to Shiva for thousands of years before Shiva took pity on him and allowed him to escape." 

Ravana means 'howling.' 

“Rama lost Sita to a formidable foe: the limited, demonic human person ality which wants to use her for its own gratification. Rama had to wander

far and wide before He could find any trace of Sita, just as you must search strenuously for Kundalini once She has self-identified with something other than the soul. Lakshmana, the one-pointed concentration which helped Rama regain His bride, was his brother's only companion for much of His search, until they met Anjaneya, who immediately enlisted in Rama's ser vice. Anjaneya is prana, the son of the god of wind. Properly hamessed, prana clears Kundalini's path to return to her Lord, which is what Anjaneya did for Sita and Rama at every step."
