## Poetic vision
We are woven twice, in two different layers of our being. The first is when the being or sat expressed itself, it being manifest as mantras. We then were the songs articulated by the first poet, Brahmā. But his poetry lacked shades and needed more colors to be infused. His grandson Shukra made it possible, weaving the threads, the chandas, once again. His love for Divyā, a demon princess with a divine name, explains the paradox behind this poetic vision. Sapped with his vigor and lust, poetry came to life, with the lineage of both gods and demons. We can still distill the mantras of the grandfather in the songs of Shukra.
