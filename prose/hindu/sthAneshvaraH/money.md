## The discovery of God
When the aliens encountered a lost civilization on the blue planet, they discovered a giant monolith with the writings "In God We Trust." They were able to relate to most of the human concepts but the term God did not resemble any of their  concepts. All their historians, anthropologists, archaeologists, philosophers and sociologists vested their energy to comprehend the signature concept that they found alien.

Since 'God' was the only alien concept to confront their world, deciphering it became synonymous for them with the recognition of the alien civilization. A few generations could have passed by the time they determined meaning. Their hypothesis was that God was some type of currency that they used and valued above all. There were imprints of god the money in all the ecological crises, all the apocalyptic diseases, and in all hunger and poverty and wars. It was for God that they killed their brothers and decimated their planet. Once the connecting concept of currency was established, everything fit together. The final evidence came from an archaeological site where they unearthed some currencies with the prints, In God We Trust.

## Mirchi Baba
I love chill. I love it so much that I even love things associated with it, like Chile. I have grown over a dozen varieties of chili in my backyard. Habanero, Bhoot Jaloka, Carolina Reaper, and many others. My latest favorite is Akbare, an Asamese Nepal variety.  And there are some ineffective ones like the capsicum.

Mirchi Baba is like the capsicum among the babas. It is not easy to make your way through the towering crowd of Babas with some famous for their chest hair and others for the length of their privates. And since the old concept of asceticism is replaced with the corporate Babas branding and selling the names of the Rishis, selling some chili in the name of God is quite alright with me. And if they can con the political leaders, who am I to object. It is like someone who cannot do without killing but only wants to kill the serial killers. And what better can they do if they want to permanently suspend their thievery by putting a period in the sentence called life.
