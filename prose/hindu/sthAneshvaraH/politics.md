## In Defense of Her Majesty
It is ridiculous for me to reconsider monarchy after four decades, as the first time I marched in the streets of Kathmandu against monarchy, I was just a teenager. But then, I had not watched The Truman Show; it was not even made. Hollywood did exist, but I had not read Baudrillard.   I did attend some carnivals but nobody even mentioned Bakhtin. My support is not for power but for grandiose, for extravagance and for the simulacra. With the royals around, we all can appreciate the Lorde within each of us. 

And her majesty should never return any of the stolen jewels +++(of India)+++. After all, who does not like the combination of the kings and the pirates.
