## In Defense of Her Majesty
It is ridiculous for me to reconsider monarchy after four decades, as the first time I marched in the streets of Kathmandu against monarchy, I was just a teenager. But then, I had not watched The Truman Show; it was not even made. Hollywood did exist, but I had not read Baudrillard.   I did attend some carnivals but nobody even mentioned Bakhtin. My support is not for power but for grandiose, for extravagance and for the simulacra. With the royals around, we all can appreciate the Lorde within each of us. 

And her majesty should never return any of the stolen jewels +++(of India)+++. After all, who does not like the combination of the kings and the pirates.

## stories
They had only stories back then when experiences were communicated directly. the size of the beast or the name of the beast did not matter much. grandpa could add some heads to the beast to make it more appealing. Stories had a transformational purpose. They represented what was directly experienced. Actually represented is a bad faith. They presented again, they evoked, the lived experiences shared by the community.

And then they discovered history. It had to be facts. and they thought facts were composed of names and times. They thought facts were expunged of narratives of those who lived it. They were the kings because they never experienced life. Just like the societies simulated extravagance and debauchery, kings simulated life from those who were very much alive. And they created facts.

And the time came when the original stories had to die. and the new story-tellers were the myth-makers. As the lived stories were already dead, myth makers fabricated the lies. Myths were reinvented again and again and myths controlled all three realms. The kings were the myth makers. Teachers were the myth makers. Businesses were making new myths and myths were keeping the businesses alive.

And there were some historians who were hanged by the kings for telling the facts.

## Trump, the Philosopher
I have always focused on Trump the madman and Trump the narcissist and Trump the savior of the Swastika. I must say I have been blind, as my Trump loving friends say. Here came  the realization after all this impeach fever.

He has normalized global collaboration in our elections. Why call it "foreign interference"? It makes the global effort look petty. It is not just Russia or Ukraine, even Modi from India joined Trump's election campaign. Had China participated in it, we would hear very little of the trade-wars. And these are all "nationalists" who have normalized this new face of globalism. Once Ganeshman said, "the people of Kathmandu are like goats and sheep." He died before experiencing America.

### Clownism
Being insane is not a strategy. Being mad is not a policy. Clownism is not a philosophy.

## The Dao of Propaganda
Any propaganda reveals inner human nature. There are idiots who believe it and propagate it for free. There are the smart ones who create it and sell it and benefit from it. And there are the wise ones who stay outside of it.

Most of the 'educated' are the first type. Either they believe Narrative one and promote it for free or they confront Narrative one by following Narrative two. They prostitute their vāc, speech, and for free. They are goaded by the smart ones like circus elephants.

There is no difference in the silence of the Buddha and that of an old and forgotten man. It is in silence that wisdom is born.

## Utopia
I sometimes dream that the rulers and the ruled ones, the government and the opposition, come together and confront the crisis. Even more, I dream of a world where two nations are not fighting for resources or to prove their supremacy. Our epics are filled with the narratives of the hero's return after the war, whether it is from the city of Troy or from Kurukshetra. There is no glory in it: a war is a mechanism of unmasking the ugly. In this epic tragedy, in this suffering of the collective of humanity, 

I sometimes dream that we can be brothers and sisters again and not fight the war that is not for us, neither is that for our children. It feels as if we are already in a post-human society where the humans are fighting to defend the humanity of the machines. In the dream I have, humans rise above and experience their full potential and experience Śiva within.

## Independence
Independence means different things in different countries. In here, it means independence from China on toilet papers.

## Fiction making
Be liberal, be conservative. Be whatever you want to be. If you want me to believe in your stories, make it believable. Do not create a fiction. Moreover, do not believe too much of your own fiction. Or you look silly. A dog has an excuse for licking himself. You don't.

## Selective amnesia
modern world lives in selective amnesia. we only like to read or remember what we want to believe in. facts are what we call are the facts. because social reality is complex, we can always find the narratives that we choose to believe in. we live in selective amnesia.

## Ecological concerns
Ecological concerns should not be framed along the party lines. This should remain a collective concern for our very being. And when it comes to the way we live our lives, it should also be about us living a life as human. However, the more the parties divide along the fault lines of decency and inhumanity, the more it gets easier to pick a side. After all, we all inherit the ape genes.


## India and Nepal
In 1985, when my logic (Nyaya) teacher, then Rector, Dr. Vidyanath Upadhyaya and Dr. Bernhard Kolver discussed the prospects for my studies in Germany, both my parents and Vedanta teachers said I should rather go to Varanasi. In the early days of my generation, only the elite class viewed the West as a superior option. As far as the lower and middle classes were concerned, the image of the educational and medical institutions in India was not inferior to their Western counterparts. Deep cultural connections are breaking and new realities are driving new generations apart.

> Bhuatanese students prefer Dhaka, Chittaging and then Australia. It has reduced unto skeleton of its former self aka new wave of extreme haughtiness.

I was discussing this issue the other day with one of my friends, ex-Nepalese ambassador to Bangladesh, and he brought to my attention that there is a strong demand among Nepalese students to go to Dhaka for higher education. This adds to your observation regarding Bhutanese students.

## Nepal News 201910
This morning I woke up feeling guilty that I have not followed any news from my birthplace. I was about to miss the state visit of Xi the Chinese emperor, Mahara the rapist senate speaker, Alam the terrorist and the leader of the Congress party, and the silent women leaders from all parties when it comes to speaking against people in power. I am sure Nepal will continue making news but I will still have to wait for the news that I wanted to hear, the news that would heal my soul.

## Concerned
Today has been the day to reflect on our concerns and the paradoxes that we live by. I am concerned about some of the national and international issues that help me bracket - even if for a moment - what I could act on and actually make a difference. I am concerned about the people and the countries or the provinces that I have never met and have never been to, while also ignoring the place and the people that need my care. 

Our concerns are not personal but ideological; because I believe such and so, I am concerned. It would be nice if the clause, "because I believe in such and so" would come to the fore of the mind the moment I am concerned. My concerns are hollow as my concerns are fundamentally finalized by the time I express my feelings. As if someone there has to act on my concerns or there will be snow-storm or tsunami or something. I am not ready to stand up for my concerns. I have seen so many other people sharing the same concerns, all walking on straws. We are just concerned beings.

Today's man is very much a concerned man. If he is concerned about justice in a faraway lands, he is also submitting to some lunatics in his fold.

## compassion and nothing
facebook network does reveal many interesting and sometimes disturbing trends, heart-warming posts and heart-numbing expressions. Our societal self does live in the paradox. one thing in particular drew my attention while scanning through the posts. 

Mostly dog-posts. How an abandoned dog needs to be adopted, and how a blind dog deserves love. Strangely, the same page welcomes ICE detention centers and separation of families and compares  immigrants beneath anything. the idea of us versus them is so powerful that the same person would adopt a blind dog but would abandon a human child to die. It is possible there is no human nature, no core, nothing.
