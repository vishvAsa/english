## Revenge of a Logician
Two friends grew up together in their gurukula, school. One studied astrology, another logic. They both became quite established in their fields. The logician (Naiyāyika) wrote a good number of commentaries and introduced some new categories. The astrologer made tons of money. Tired of his poverty, the logician embarked to see his successful friend and ask for his help.

It is hard to imagine how quickly people change when they become successful. The astrologer could not stop making fun of the poor logician for the choice of his subject. And the villagers laughed at his cost. Heart-broken, the logician said farewell. When his friend tried to give him some money, he asked for just one single hair. The astrologer happily pulled one hair and gave it as a gift.

Confused, some villagers followed the logician and asked, why would you need a hair from the astrologer? The logician replied, "oh! you poor villagers have no idea he is a Maha Siddha, a person with supernatural powers. A single hair from his body well kept in my house will make me a rich man."+++(5)+++

That was all it was needed for the villagers to gather and pull all the hairs from the body of the astrologer.

## Vivekananda
What I like the most about Vivekananda is that he made his spiritual quest a part of rational human inquiry.+++(5)+++ He did not pose himself as some supernatural being; he explored rational grounds for his beliefs and he trashed beliefs that he deemed irrational. He did not invoke his authority on the basis of his origins or his private experiences. While his teachings are grounded on Advaita, he did not use non-duality to market himself as God. It is his humanity that makes him great.


## Clown
A friend of mine rejected to submit his dissertation and instead decided to be an entertainer. He sang, played guitar, and sometimes became a clown and cherished children in their birthday parties. I wanted to see him before leaving town when I took my first big job. There I found him in a park, cheering up children with his painted face and funny sounds. he graciously hugged me and whispered, 'do not forget we are all in entertainment business!'

When Vardhamana walked out of Vaishali barefoot, he must have had the zeal to learn, to discover, and not to be entertained. when he stood up in deep meditation for years and years, i do not believe anybody cheered or clapped.May be he soaked all the desire in humanity to learn. all we want today is carnival. without Bakhtin, we would not even know what we really want.

## Dialogue
I still love Udayana. For, look at his way of reasoning: parānabhyupagamena hetvasiddheś ca | The reason you give is unfounded because that is not accepted by the other party.+++(5)+++

Today's religious dialogues and even broader social conversations rest on private reasoning; you say it is P because it is Y but only you know why Y should confirm P. And if someone asks for concomitance (vyāpti), you pull out Gun.

## Readers and Writers
Eco was brutally honest when he said, "You know, I don't read, I write."+++(Actually no- that's Eco's answer to ward off fan enquiries about whether he's read this or that book.)+++ I myself am struggling in between. It is not a lack of devotion on reading, neither is the loss in appetite to write. These two hungers are insatiable. You can convince Quixote or even Trump that they have saved the world from the monster windmill but you cannot convince yourself that you have read enough if you are a reader, or have written enough, if you like to write.+++(5)+++

My teachers did not train me to write. Our job was to read and our teachers' task was to create passionate readers.+++(5)+++ When someone approached my grand teacher Padma Prasad Bhattarai to write on Nyaya, his response was: first read all that is written and then come back to me with requests like that. And my teachers like Mukunda and Dirgharaj and Bidur never tired of citing their teacher for the virtue in not writing. Kabir went the other direction, he saw meaninglessness in reading. He never said anything about writing though. A friend of mine recently caught me while reading and cited Kabir: nobody has been wise by reading books. He did not answer though when I asked why is he reading Kabir then?

Any way, readers seem to have a different dharma to uphold than the writers. Readers admire the pearl but writers cut it out of the shell. Readers can afford to not read some writers but writers have to read not just what they like but they have to particularly read what they do not like.+++(4)+++ Writers are like Shiva who relish in their enclosure, enchanted with their romantic thoughts, while readers are like Agni the fire that receives the first seeds of wisdom or the waters that nourish ideas so that the children they raise can have multiple heads.+++(4)+++

## Conference
We all must have been to one or another conference but we hardly contemplate upon its taxonomy. For example, do you know the difference between Coyote conference and Rat conference? Have you even heard of the Skunk conference?

Let me tell you. A Coyote Conference is where the folks gather and talk about their grievances; they share how their cultures have been colonized and how their native lands have been encroached, and how they have to be united against the empire. These conferences generally last for half an hour and the objective of the conference is to show who can scream loudly. And this makes the foundation for electing the leader. 

A Rat conference, on the other hand, is a gathering of the victims where nobody has the courage to act and the cats still lack the bell. 

Skunk conference is very difficult for the non-skunks to fathom. For, they all scream and run around releasing the gas but they themselves are immune to it. Skunks are very parochial in that regard.



## The Birth of Bhāmati
Attuned to the unfolding of the words being measured to reflect deeper dimensions, Vācaspati is not even aware that the day has fallen and darkness has crawled in. With a sudden glow of light, he rushes to finish the last sentence of the day. At this moment, dark ink spreads over the page, some drops of water confronting its white surface. Surprised, Vācaspati looks above, only to encounter an elderly woman with wrinkles and gray hair. Astonished he asks, 'who are you?' The lady replies, "I am your wife my lord. You have been so busy with your studies, you never manged time to see my face from the youth of my teens to now sixties. I have spent half a century together, my lord, and finally today you have noticed me." 

Like a tiny frog in a big lake, she remained hidden, underneath the surface level of consciousness. All Vācaspati thought in those five decades were interrelated and disconnected thoughts.

Many die without feeling guilty. They can as well argue that there is no emotional experience of guilt. Vācaspati would have died just the same had he not felt guilty for once in his lifetime. Approaching her feet, he begs for her forgiveness. "My lord", she responds, "there is nothing to forgive. I have served you well, have remained your faithful wife, and I would have been old with or without you noticing. I do not know if I would have felt carnal pleasure but I sure would have loved a child from you."

Vācaspati may have been the first philosopher to recognize mimetic corporeality besides the genetic one. We live mimesis, and Bhartṛhari would have added, all is speech anyway. It is one way to see matter and another way to see speech. Now the machine beings call it codes. He names the text as Bhāmati, and offers it to her, saying, 'this is your daughter.' 

We can always find meaninglessness in Vācaspati's way of life but I leave that to the exitsentialists. There really is nothing that is inherently meaningful and neither is there anything that cannot be made meaningful. It is like beauty; meaning is something you have to see. The first time I opened Bhāmati, I was just a teenager and I could feel her friendly touch. This book has been very personal to me. 

Many must have fantasized Bhāmati with her dark curly hair and big almond eyes but Bhāmati has chosen to age with me. Even though the cover is worn and parts torn, Bhamati still reconnects with me. Vācaspati did not leave his body but he did leave his mind. And the offering he made does reflect his basic nature.

## Academic Calendar
Is it too early to float the idea of having a longer winter vacation and a short summer vacation? We do not know if this Corona is going to be seasonal. Even if we take total control over this virus, cold and flu affect faculty, student and families every year and winter is always the worst.

We also have lost the rationale behind the summer vacation. Our students do not help their families to grow crops during the summer. In many places summer heat is more manageable than the winter snowstorms. Unlike the vrātyas and śramaṇas, we do not wander in the forest either.

To me, it makes more sense that we change our academic calendar and make winter a three month vacation.

## Descartes
Let me entertain you with the first rule of Descartes for the direction of the mind:

> "The aim of our studies should be to direct the mind with a view to forming true and sound judgments about whatever comes before it. "

Apparently there was time when scholars actually believed things like truth.
