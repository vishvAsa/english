## Are you human?
Every time I log onto something, I am asked serious questions, like right now, I am reviewing a paper for a journal and the system asks me to click, "I am a human." Often times, I have been asked to confirm, I am not a robot. Is there any room left for the skeptics like myself in this world?

## Liking
Facebook is making our concept of liking very shallow. When I clicked like for one page it said I already liked it. There is no room for me to like the same thing again and again. Well this says all about the Facebook likes.
