## Are you human?
Every time I log onto something, I am asked serious questions, like right now, I am reviewing a paper for a journal and the system asks me to click, "I am a human." Often times, I have been asked to confirm, I am not a robot. Is there any room left for the skeptics like myself in this world?

## Liking
Facebook is making our concept of liking very shallow. When I clicked like for one page it said I already liked it. There is no room for me to like the same thing again and again. Well this says all about the Facebook likes.

## Machine-like
The ratio in which humanity is striving to be machine-like mirrors the speed in which we are seeking the machines to be human-like. Our agency is already assimilated with machine-functions, an extension of the motor-functions of the human organs. We may as well start calling ourselves manchines.

## Erase
let us edit our memories and implant our experiences and project our imaginations and at the end of the rope, let us sit together and wonder, is there anything real? and wait, who is asking the question? let us erase even that subject.
