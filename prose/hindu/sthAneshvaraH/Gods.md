## All-knowing
Today I am having compassion for the being that is said to be all-knowing. and this compassion extends also to my philosopher colleagues who have extensively worked on omniscience. For every fact, there are millions of fabrications. One cannot actually know what love is like without experiencing it first hand. But what about hate? But I am more worried about knowing things like infinity. I do not think that all-knowing entity has not fathomed it, but then that would be finite. i am perfectly fine to remain ignorant than to know the hair count in every single rat ball, past and future.

Knowing negative facts is in itself a daunting achievement, knowing every single co-ordinate and every possible genetic composition is mind-boggling. We the ignorant humans can cherish our ignorance for at least we can learn something new, be excited about knowing something new, listen to new music that we never heard before, see a place that we had never been before. This is fun. What is fun in not being able to laugh on little jokes or taste a fruit that you did not even know existed.

Can this all-knowing being create something that he did not know before or did not exist in the screen of his mind before? May be this all-knowing being is like me who has to go to the doctor to find out if I have any disease in my body.

## True Colors
Alice Wells argues that the law in Nepal that criminalizes forceful religious conversion has threatened the minority communities. Basically, America is demanding forceful conversion in Nepal.

## How to make god
A friend of mine worked on new religious movements. She encouraged me to also research in this direction but I was too rigid. I have now come to the realization that if you want to understand what constitutes religion, it is easier by means of reading new movements. This is not because you get to read a new bible but because you get to write one. And not because you can choose between this or that god but you can make one. I came to this realization upon my trip to Nepal this time when I also chanced to see god. God is what power and money says it is. This handicapped innocent boy projected to be god is not my first encounter with the divine. I have met babajis and ammajis before but their disguise was too sophisticated for me to analyze. Any time I meet someone claiming to be god either I feel funny or appalled. A scholar cannot feel either. This is why I am not a scholar to study god. But if you have decided to invest your life studying god, study the living ones. That is where you can actually see the sacred being formed. Think of the womb and the slime and the fluid and also a new life, a baby. You cannot have one without the other. Lying in the lap of his mother, this innocent handicapped boy was no less a charisma. And there were rich and powerful people making him god.

A part of me is skeptic. But unlike the ordained skeptics, I have sought gurus and asked for their instructions.+++(4)+++ Thanks to my teachers for investing time teaching me Nagarjuna and Sriharsa, I am cut for something else. But god is not something I can ignore. Particularly when it is next door, living and breathing, and the crowd cheering and chanting his mantras. I can understand being a nonbeliever. I just cannot understand being a believer and not believing in unbelievable. If you are a believer, you should believe the most unbelievable. Otherwise you are an imposter. If you question a hermit whether he is enlightened, you are like me. But I understand that you want to be a believer and not believe anything else or that would not make a real belief. But have you ever questioned whether your story is the most unbelievable among all? Find the one, and stick to it.

First I thought humans have god for the concept of all powerful being watching over them. That was when I would trade my book for a candy. And then I realized that humans have god to make them almighty, to make them god-makers. By carefully crafting god, humans have mastered the art of defining the absolute. Defining parallels domesticating. Definitions confine. And when you can make the least believable of all the stories as the most potent of all, you are now a real god-maker. Who would follow Moses for seeing a bush burning! “It was all ablaze but nothing was burning,” and you get the followers.+++(5)+++ When the Buddha said, I do feel hunger, his followers abandoned him. And when he said, I have realized all that is there to be realized, they rejoined. Followers are like that.

A god has to be your puppet. Otherwise why would the believers make so many demands from their gods. If you believe that humans conceived of god to fathom the absolute, you are very much misguided. It is by means of god that humans have discovered their absolute nature. The first among them were the priest kings, as god would privately counsel them. And then came the race among those claiming their god is more powerful than the other’s. But what they missed in this triumphant race is the core that it was supposed to be hollow. You can enjoy a sand castle as long as you know it is made of sand. Once you believe it to be real, you are not playing any more. The same applies to monopoly or thief and police. The moment you think you are a real police, the game is over. This is the problem with old beliefs. They are so deeply engrained that believers do not know it was all make believe. And this turns into nightmare.+++(5)+++ I had the most productive time seeing the way this little boy was made god by a few rich and powerful people. They are still playing the game of make believe. This is where the sacred is alive as the human has not forgotten creativity. The highest among all forms of creativity lies in making god.
