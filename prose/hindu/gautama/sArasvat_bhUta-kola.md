So here is an interesting story from a place close to my hometown. Long ago, during when Goa was undergoing strife a Saraswat Brahmin family migrated to coastal Karnataka and moved to an interior place. They brought with them an amsha of their kuladevi. They were given land by the Jain landlord of that area for the Brahmin was able to cure an ailment in the landlord's family with the gandha and tIrtha offered to the Kuladevi. 

Several generations later, the descendents moved to a nearby town as most of them needed to be in the town for their livelihood. It was increasingly becoming difficult to manage the temple in the village while the family members were in town. They constructed a new temple for the Devi in the town. The Nithya pooja was carried out in the town temple from then on. This went on for a few years. 

One day during the bhUta kola in the village, the bhUtas expressed displeasure. Now there is nithya pUja in both the village and the town temples. So a Devi who came from a village in Goa was known to the Bhutas of the place where She was brought to. Where is any scope for contradiction here ?
