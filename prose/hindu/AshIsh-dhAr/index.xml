      <title>2021 White pill</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A rare random white pill.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;At this point, Hindu resurgence is approaching a point of inflection. There was one such turning point some years back, which significantly shifted the Overton window away from the inane secularist gibberish that followed from the state sponsored indoctrination also called Indian schooling. The indoctrination went on unchecked in the pre-internet era. With the coming of the internet, it took just a decade for truth to prevail on the emotional plane and a large number of people outgrew their conditioning and fear to start speaking freely about things that had oppressed them.+++(5)+++ Those who couldn&amp;rsquo;t keep up with the change became irrelevant. People lost friends, there were fights among family members and neighbours over history, politics and religion. This was a moment of clarity.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>2022 Hindu situation</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The recent spate of Hindu k!11!ngs in Kashmir is not surprising, at least to those who place the truth above loyalty to strangers in power. For everyone else it is yet another ineffective reality check that does not even generate online outrage any longer. But why are H so obstinately immune to reality? Here are five systemic reasons, in no particular order but all organically linked and reinforcing each other to form a vicious cycle.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Economy vs Justice</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I had the great misfortune of being a witness in an open and shut civil suit in a Delhi court. The case was filed in Apr 2019 and the judge had it entirely figured out in the first two hearings which were done by June. It&amp;rsquo;s been over 2 years since. I&amp;rsquo;ve lost count of the number of hearings now &amp;amp; there is absolutely zero progress. Luckily the complainant can afford to pay the lawyer just for marking attendance. This forced me to rethink my assumptions about the role of judiciary in India.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Source: &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.facebook.com/ashish.dhar.del/posts/10158730455161433&#34;&gt;TW&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Although intrinsically related, Jaati and Varna can be considered separate for the purpose of grasping the concepts. Even historically, Varna was not always discernible for there is no empirical laboratory test to determine the same. When the British started categorising Hindu communities into castes, they frequently ran into people who knew their jaati but didn&amp;rsquo;t even know what to make of the term &amp;lsquo;Varna&amp;rsquo;. That does not mean that Varna is expendable but quite simply that it does not lend itself to reductionist hot takes by politicians. Varna can therefore be treated as a theoretical idea for the purpose of analysis.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;[Replug from April 2018] &lt;em&gt;Adi Shankaracharya&lt;/em&gt;&#xA;The Wikipedia entry for Adi Shankara introduces him as &amp;ldquo;an early 8th century Indian philosopher and theologian who consolidated the doctrine of Advaita Vedanta&amp;rdquo;. It is reflective of the modern understanding of his life and achievements. Therefore, it is patently untrue.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The 8th century claim has, of course, been contested by the very mathas he established but there are even more significant things that would be called &amp;lsquo;problematic&amp;rsquo;. Adi Shankara was not a mere philosopher, though debating was his favourite method of teaching and he was certainly not a theologian, for he was not speculating on the nature of God. Advaita proclaims the unity of Atman and Nirguna Brahman, which has no attributes. How can we hope to describe that which has no attributes? As Shankara himself writes,&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;That Kashmir earned for itself the title, &amp;lsquo;Rishi-waer&amp;rsquo; or the garden of Rishis, is not a matter of chance or romantic speculation. If you were born in Kashmir as a Hindu, you would have to be exceedingly obtuse to miss this glaring everyday fact of life. The valley was indeed a powerhouse that seemed to attract high-voltage specimens of our species. They were called &amp;ldquo;maet&amp;rdquo; in plural, crazy literally or &amp;ldquo;mastanas&amp;rdquo;. They were too ecstatic to be coherent, too blissful to be sane, too evolved to be civilized.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Two things happened today. First, I read about the statements on Kashmir made by a couple of Kashmiri Pandit ladies, Nitasha Kaul and Aarti Tikoo Singh (incidentally a darling of the Raitawing), at the US House Foreign Affairs Committee hearing. I quote from the written statement submitted by the latter: &amp;ldquo;What the foot-soldiers of the Pakistani military and ISI (Inter-Services Intelligence) have done to ordinary Kashmiri Muslims in the last 30 years, pales in comparison to the human rights violations committed by the Indian state.‚Äù+++(5)+++&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Male degradation</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Allowing the government to take care of us is always about the tacit consent to removing our skin from the game, superficially akin to outsourcing the disagreeable or difficult tasks to experts but closer to giving up personal and communal responsibility. There is a line to be drawn somewhere but apparently we ran out of ink long back. It is a vicious circle that we descended into at the time of independence, or maybe even before that.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Meaning vs power</title>
      <link>https://vishvAsa.github.io/english/prose/hindu/AshIsh-dhAr/meaning_vs_power/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In a recent conversation with a friend on the rising threat associated with speaking your mind in a typical American workplace, I remarked that the abandonment of the sacred realm in modern society has made people emotionally fragile and socially handicapped. In healthy traditional societies, the sacred belongs to the Gods. In societies that are falling apart, the idea of a jealous grandfather in the sky and his sidekick occupies that space but still manages to keep insanity at bay. But what happens to a society that degenerates further and takes the journey from Gods to the one true God to its logical conclusion, i.e doing away with the sacred entirely? In other words, how has modern society coped with the loss of the sacred realm, other than by diligently working to destroy the planet?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>pashubali learnings</title>
      <link>https://vishvAsa.github.io/english/prose/hindu/AshIsh-dhAr/pashubali-learnings/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Learnings from the reactions to pashubali from the krantikaris of modern India:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;There is little to differentiate a rootless liberal from a political Hindu when it comes to their views on Dharma.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Modern Hindus lack a basic understanding of fundamental aspects/concepts of Dharma like sampradAya, adhikAra, shAstra, pramAna etc.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Respect for figures of authority like the revered AchAryas is completely missing and so is an awareness, much less the appreciation, of the rich dialectical tradition they have unfortunately inherited.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;People actually think that rituals and texts CAN and MUST be amended to suit their personal whims.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Most don&amp;rsquo;t seem to comprehend the difference between devas (deities) and brahman (supreme reality). No, most don&amp;rsquo;t even know that there is something called brahman, which is different from brAhman. There is only that God fellow.+++(5)+++&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Not surprisingly, most Hindus have imbibed a deeply Protestant sense of religiosity. Reality is simply what they believe in, complexity and nuance be damned.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;They have no independent value system and everything is evaluated in reference to others. Like bali is bad because &amp;rsquo;they&amp;rsquo; also slaughter animals.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;There is a profound absence of skin-in-the-game. Imposition of alien moral standards does not evoke an intuitive revolt from most people.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The creme de la creme among these guys consists of AryasamAjis who believe that whatever seems cursorily unpleasant in smritis is the work of Max Muller and other colonial scholars. For example, they have a sanitized version of Manusmriti called Vishuddha Manusmriti.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The phenomenon is not restricted to the urban and English speaking types but pervades the entirety of our blessed geography, especially north of the Vindhyas.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;They have zero personal experience of upasana  and sadhana so it is dismissed out of hand. (As Rohit Arya rightly commented below)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;They have totally internalized the colonial discourse on Hindu practices. When they run out of things to say, they blurt out random words like Sati, narbali etc without pausing to think how it is relevant to the discussion. (Point courtesy Neha Srivastava)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Any sacred sthal is equivalent to a picnic spot and should hence be transformed into such for the ease of the tourist, the environment and deity can go to hell for all they care. (Point courtesy Rupam Das)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I will add more points as and when I come across fresh gobar on Social Media.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Religion of Awe</title>
      <link>https://vishvAsa.github.io/english/prose/hindu/AshIsh-dhAr/religion_of_awe/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A hundred thousand years ago, we were just noisy apes halfway up the forest food chain. Then something happened. We gave up the insistence on close blood ties to form the bonds of trust. We learnt the art of large-scale collaboration. Sapiens began to dominate the planet and raced to the top of the pyramid.&#xA;This rush to the top, attributable entirely to a large number of homosapiens working towards common objectives was made possible by the art of storytelling. For a species that is naturally lacking in mutual trust, the unforeseen camaraderie among total strangers to achieve collective objectives was brought in through the backdoor, by the invention of abstract concepts and fictional descriptions of the world. This belief in fiction to organize people into teams is what truly sets us apart from our less evolved cousins. Everything that we do is driven by fiction. From loyalty to the country to working in a corporation, all collective human activity is driven by imagined stories of progress and greatness as opposed to concrete perceivable realities.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>VHP &amp; bajrang dal</title>
      <link>https://vishvAsa.github.io/english/prose/hindu/AshIsh-dhAr/vhp_bajrang-dal/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Too many people suddenly feeling nostalgic about Bajrang Dal and VHP. They are lamenting that they are no longer a patch on what they used to be. Well, they were cut down to size by the bigshots as soon as they started smelling power in the 90s. The thing is the bigshots were uncomfortable with their existence because the so-called goons were no longer politically useful to them and only embarrassed them in the media, 5-star conferences, and lit fests. So, the big names started distancing themselves from these outfits. But the real blow came after their 2004 defeat in national elections. The state leadership of Gujarat, led by leader ji, started reopening all the closed cases against VHP and Bajrang Dal. The govt got so vicious that they forced a firebrand VHP leader, Prahlad Shastri, to commit suicide in 2005.+++(5)+++&lt;/p&gt;</description>
