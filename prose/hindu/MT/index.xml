      <description>&lt;p&gt;Source: &lt;a href=&#34;https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2005/04/25/the-new-farce-of-banabhatta/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;bANa had just written a new play and was showing it to rAja harSha. harSha said he was impressed and decided that it must be put upon stage without any further delay. harSha called in his entertainers and asked them to make the arrangements. After a while, the entertainers reported to the mahArAjAdiraja parama-bhaTTAraka of sthAneshwara stating that they were hard-pressed to find a suitable vidUShaka for the play. The rAja thought for a while and quipped: “I am pretty certain that our paNDita, shri bANa could as well be the vidUShaka. ” He summoned bANa and asked him to be the vidUShaka in his own play. bANa complained: “How can I be the vidUShaka? I have never acted before.” “All the better”; said the king. “I have decided that you shall be the vidUShaka yourself”. All bANa could do was to enjoy himself at his own expense.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Source: &lt;a href=&#34;https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2003/08/13/charlottes-tale/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Charlotte narrated me a strange incidence as we were recuperating from a session in the wild observing local fungal genera. Normally I do not suffer such tales lightly, but on this occasion I found some strange connection with certain imprints from my own past, and accordingly listened to her in rapt attention. At that time Charlotte had just arrived from her native land and preceded me by an year to the big city where I was to later live. In its suburbs she rented the basement of the sprawling house of an elderly sullen gentleman who was trying to make some money to meet his ends me. It suited her graduate student’s salary fine, and despite the queerness of the man, she chose to hold out at that outpost.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
