The nAyaka-s & nAyika-s of somAkhyAdi don't see a need to repeatedly emphasize their distinctness from the rest. They remain friendly with those who don't cross their mental sphere but are good to get along in the world like Vidrum & while staying away from the likes of Gardabh, Mahish, Samikaran(unpubl) who are entirely incompatible with them; So they acknowledge the ways of the mass & see no reason to seek victimhood in the mass'es lack of appreciation for their ways.
