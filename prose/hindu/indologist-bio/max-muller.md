Lady Blennerhasset, a well-known literary and social figure of the 
last quarter of the nineteenth century, wrote to Mrs Max Muller after the 
death of her husband ‘My admiration for your husband makes me envy 
the task of him or her, who will be his biographer There are few lives so 
rich, so attractive, so truly interesting, from the intellectual and purely 
human point of view ’ 

During the four years which I took to write this biography I have felt 
that she was right in saying so It has been a memorable experience for 
me, and not merely a task The introduction which follows will explain 
why I undertook to write Max Muller’s life anew after the first and last 
biography so far written was published in 1902 Here I shall only set 
down my obligations 

First and foremost, my thanks are due to my friend, Laurens van der 
Post, for having suggested the project to me After him I am indebted to 
the two grandsons of Max Muller, Mr Charles and Mr J H Max-Muller, 
(anglice) for the interest they have taken in the work, and especially to 
Mr J H Max-Muller for the readiness with which he has helped me 
with documents and books A very large volume of Max Muller’s papers 
have been deposited by Mr J H Max-Muller in the Bodleian for the use 
of those who might be interested in his work and life He has also given 
me access to papers which are still with the family Without this help this 
book could not have been written 

Dr Hunt, Keeper of the Western MSS in the Bodleian, and the staff of 
Duke Humphrey’s Library — Mr Vaisey, Mr Porter, Mr Harris and their 
assistants — have been very helpful and courteous, so making the consul- 
tation of the papers in the Library not only research but an agreeable 
spending of time I am indebted to Mr Alexander of the Library for help- 
ing with passages in Greek and Latin, not all quoted in the book 

In India I would record my obligation to Margaret Chatterji and 
Parimal Goswami for supplying me with certain information I wanted, 
and also to my dead friend Gopal Bhattacharya for the same kind of help 

I must next thank the helper without whom this book would not have 
been published As written by me, it became too long to be a commercial 
proposition, and since I did not have the time to carry out the editing it 
was undertaken by Ingaret Giffard As the author of the book I would say 
that the omissions have been made and the editing done with extra- 
ordinary skill There is nothing more delicate and difficult than to deal 
with another man’s writing Ingaret Giffard’s handling of this tricky task 
was such that when I lead the results of her editing in the proofs — not 



ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS 


having looked into the edited typescript, I could not be sure where the 
cuts had been made, and I discovered them by an effort of the memory I 
think no author could say more about the editing of his work 

But skilled as the editing has been, it has also to be pointed out that it 
was bound to have another aspect Max Muller’s life was so many-sided 
and information about it is so voluminous that even in the original version 
I could not include many things which I should have liked to have dealt 
with If all the details could have been retained, the book would have been 
more colourful, but, on the other hand, the streamlining will make for a 
coherent and clean-cut impression And I would stress that only illustra- 
tive details have been cut, no basic feature of the book has been interfered 
with, and its spirit has been wholly preserved 

My publishers have been very generous and forbearing with me during 
the long gestation of the book, and without prodding me have taken keen 
personal mterest in its progress 

I want to acknowledge the authority that has been given me to use 
manuscript material the telegrams from Queen Victoria and Albert 
Edward (Prince of Wales) on the illness and death of Max Muller have 
been reproduced by the gracious permission of Her Majesty Queen 
Elizabeth II, and the letters from Lord Salisbury and Lord Curzon by 
the courtesy respectively of the Marquess of Salisbury and the Viscount 
Scarsdale 

Last of all, I must set down my gratitude to Oxford, where I wrote the 
book Of course, since the papers were in the Bodleian, I had to be here 
But I did not work at Oxford only as a research student I had to imbibe 
the spirit of the place where Max Muller spent his life, and the book would 
never have been what it is if only its materials were gathered at Oxford

### IMPORTANT NOTE 

The fact that Max Muller was German by birth and spent his early 
life in Germany, has quite unnecessarily fixed the idea that he was a 
German scholar writing in German Actually, he was naturalized in 
England and always wrote in English with complete mastery of the 
language, except when he employed German for a special purpose in a 
book, article, or his correspondence The lists given in the two appendices 
specify which books or documents are in German All others are in his 
own English

### INTRODUCTION 

This book is a biography, that is to say, an account of the life of a 
man who was a scholar and a thinker, it is not except incidentally a 
discussion or evaluation of his work in the fields of knowledge with 
which his scholarship was concerned But a biography should not be 
inflicted on a reading public without proper justification, I do not 
think that a man is entitled to such treatment only on the strength 
of his position and fame in his own age, unless in addition he played 
so important and significant a role in history that he remains an 
element to be reckoned with in understanding the continuing evo- 
lution of a particular people or humanity in general; nor unless his 
personality and activities belong to a type whose presence and 
functiomng is continuous and umversal, so that no outstanding 
individual of the type ever loses his relevance to all ages 

Whether Max Muller deserves a new biography in the light of 
such a criterion cannot be discussed without taking note of two 
indisputable facts about him the first, that he is almost completely 
forgotten today, and the second, that when he died in 1900 and 
for thirty years before that he was a world figure Both of these have 
to be considered, more especially his great contemporaneous repu- 
tation 

In Britain, which was his adopted country and where he spent 
all his working life of over fifty years, his name means nothing out- 
side the circle of professional Indologists, linguists and mytho- 
logists, and even within it the recollection is dim It is the same in 
Germany where he was born and brought up, though above all it 
was he who was responsible for building up the reputation and 
prestige of the Germans as the most admiring, sympathetic, and 
profound interpreters of Hindu civilization and spirituality Even 
m India, where he was a legend and an institution combined, he is 
now only vaguely remembered as a German intermediary between 
India and Europe, and Indians hardly remember that if Max 
Muller was a German, he was equally an Englishman It is only 
very recently that the cultural projection of western Germany of 
today has revived his name by calling its centres in the big cities of 
India Max Mueller Bhavans or Houses Through this the Germans 
have put the memory and prestige of Max Muller behind their

cultural propaganda though he was interested only in presenting 
the rediscovered ancient India, and not Germany, to modern Indians 
His contemporary position has now to be set against the current 
eclipse His prestige was as impressive in its geographical range, 
extending from the Umted States to Japan, as it was by its recog- 
nition by all social classes from royalty to common people Witness 
the reaction to the news of his death He died at half-past eleven in 
the mor ning of Sunday, October 28, 1900 Immediately, messages 
of condolence began to pour in to his home at Oxford from all over 
the world, sent by emperors and kings as well as persons of less 
exalted worldly status One of the first to come was that from Queen 
Victoria, herself to die in less than three months She wrote to Mrs 
Max Muller ‘It is with the truest concern that I learn that your 
dear and excellent husband passed away today ’ There were also 
telegrams from her son, the future Edward VII, her daughters, the 
Empress Frederick and Princess Christian, her grandson, Kaiser 
William II , and many more royal personages The most touching 
and intimate among these came from the Queen of Rumania, a 
German princess by birth and better known under her pen name of 
Carmen Sylva. She wrote 

Last night the King woke me in the first sleep with the sad, sad news 
Of course, I did not sleep again, thinking of you, and watching with 
you through this long night, and its loneliness 1 Oh, how I wish I could 
fly to you, and look once more into that most beautiful face, in which 
harmony of thought, and love, and noble refinement met, in 
every curve of the lip, in every line, that had been marked by the in- 
tensity of thought and feeling 

From an Indian social reformer, Malaban, came the message, ‘All 
India mourns with you’, and that embodied the feeling of all 
educated Indians 

The funeral took place on November 1 Early in the mormng of 
that day the coffin was moved from his home to St Mary’s (the 
University church), and placed in Adam de Brome’s chapel, wheie 
the mourners assembled Though no invitations had been sent out 
the large church was entirely filled by people from all walks of life, 
including representatives of the Queen and the German Emperor 
The Crown Prince of Siam was also among the mourners. The 
congregation followed the coffin on foot to the Holywell cemetery, 
where the body of the scholar, who had come to Oxford as an un-

known and pool youth fifty-two years before, was laid to rest A 
friend who was attending the service noticed that a little bird sitting 
on a branch nearby went on singing all through the service, un- 
scared by the crowd and the noise Remembering that Max Muller 
was a philologist, one could say that it was like the grammarian’s 
funeral in the epoch of the Revival of Learning described by 
Browning 


Hail to your purlieus, 

All ye highfliers of the feathered race, 

Swallows and curlews* 

Here’s the top-peak, the multitude below 
Live, for they can, there , 

This man decided not to Live but to Know — 

Bury this man there ? 

No 1 yonder sparkle is the citadel's 
Circling its summit 

Thither our path lies, wind we up the heights 

For in that bygone age even the grammatical knowledge of a dead 
language was the key to a new life Max Muller’s speciality was 
knowledge of Sanskrit which, though a pioneering study when he 
was young, had hardened into a narrow academic discipline when 
he died Yet his funeral was a throw back to an older tradition 
On the following Sunday memorial services were held in many 
churches in England, including Westminster Abbey, and the whole 
world press published editorials and obituary notices These were 
not just matter-of-fact accounts of his scholarly work, but tributes 
giving expression to a feeling that an epoch was closing Le Temps 
of Paris summed up his special contribution to knowledge with the 
observation Tt is a figure from the heroic age of Oriental and 
linguistic studies which disappears’, and the Journal des Debats 
recalled his work in its widest scope and wrote ‘The death of Max 
Muller not only creates a sadly felt gap in historical and philological 
studies, but also extinguishes the beacon of light to which over the 
whole world thinking men turned their eyes ’ In India distinguished 
scholars like R G Bhandarkar and R C Dutt paid tributes to him 
Similar interest mixed with concern was also shown during his 
serious illness the previous yeai Examining a volume of his papers 
m the Bodleian I found at its beginning a whole sheaf of pink tele- 
gram forms* The very first telegram was ‘Sept zy ’99 — To Mrs 



4 SCHOLAR EXTRAORDINARY 

Max Muller I heard with great regret of the serious illness of your 
husband and am anxious to hear how he is and hoping he is better 
V R I [Victoria, Regina Imperatrix], Balmoral ? The next telegram 
was also from her, and the third ran 'Much grieved to hear how 
seriously ill your husband is Trust you are able to give me better 
accounts Albert Edward [Prince of Wales and the future Edward 
VII] 9 There were many more from royal and other personages 
But I consider a letter about this illness from an ordinary middle- 
class Hindu in Madras to be the most significant He wrote 

Madras, December 13, 1899 

Most respected Sir, Sunday was the mail day, on which English mail 
letters are delivered at Madras That morning, while I was eagerly 
expecting the postman, he gave me a card received from you, in which 
the following lines were written 'Professor Max Muller is seriously ill 
and not able to attend to any letters ’ When I saw these lines tears 
trickled down my cheeks unconsciously When I showed the card to 
my friends who spend the last days of their life like mine in reading the 
Bhagavatgitha and some such religious books, they were also very 
much overpowered with grief 

Last night when we were going to Sri Parthasarathy Swami temple 
as usual for devotions, one thing suggested to me, and that was that I 
should have some special service performed to God (Sri Parthasarathy 
Swami, the presiding deity in the temple here) by the temple priest in 
your name for your complete recovery When I expressed my sugges- 
tion to my friends that followed me to the temple they were unanimous 
m their opinion that it was the best that can be done for a gentleman 
like you who has sacrificed his health and wealth to the good of India 
and the Hmdus in particular The temple priest was immediately sent 
for and we disclosed to him our object He raised many objections to 
have our object accomplished, and the chief one of his objections was 
that he can’t offer prayers and enchant mantrams to God in the name 
of one who is not a Hindu by birth, and if he does so in the name of a 
Christian he will not only be dismissed from the service of the temple, 
but will also be excommunicated from his caste But, when one of 
our friends promised to him to pay ample renumeration for the purpose, 
he acceded to the request Then the next day each of us subscribed our 
mite and paid to the priest some rupees 

The rest of the letter (which is given by Mrs Max Muller in her 
biography in a paiaphrased and coirected form) described how they 
went to the temple the next day with the usual offerings of coconut, 
flowers, and sacred leaves and had the rite for recovery performed. 



INTRODUCTION 


5 


Max Muller’s relations with India and Indians were a major 
element in his life and an essential part of his vocation So they will 
have to be described and considered as fully as possible in this book 
Here I shall quote some general statements One comes from an 
American writer, Moncure D Conway, who had known him for 
thirty years and contributed the obituary article in the North 
American Review In it he wrote ‘Wherever I went I usually met the 
students and the pundits, and a number of the titled men, and all of 
these, of whatever caste or sect, regarded Max Muller as the greatest 
of mankind, and I was charged with messages entreating him to 
visit India This enthusiasm of the cultured influenced even the 
illiterate ’ 

To this I would add the tribute of one of the greatest of modern 
Indians, Swami Vivekananda, the preacher of neo-Hmduism 
‘There are a number of great souls in the West,’ he wrote in Bengali 
— and I am giving a translation — ‘who undoubtedly are well- 
wishers of India, but I am not aware of one in Europe who is a 
greater well-wisher He is not only a well-wisher, but also a deep 
believer in Indian philosophy and religion Though all through 
life he has lived with and steeped himself in ancient Sanskrit 
literature the India of the Professoi’s imagination is not simply 
that which resounded with the chanting of the Vedas and from 
which sacrificial smoke rose to the sky he also is ever alert 
to whatever in the way of new developments is happening in every 
corner of India and keeps himself well-posted about them ’ 

I could illustrate the nature of Max Muller’s influence on India 
even better by giving a humbler example, for instance, how as a 
child I came to know about him My father was not a highly edu- 
cated man in the formal sense, for he had received only a school 
education and that too in the backwaters of East Bengal and not in 
Calcutta, the centre of modern Bengali culture None the less, it was 
he who explained to me how Max Muller had established that our 
languages and the European languages belonged to the same 
family, that our words, pita , mata, duhita , etc , were the same as the 
English words, ‘father’, ‘mother’, ‘daughter’, etc , that Sanskrit 
Dyaus Pitr and the Greek Zeus Pater were identical, and that we 
Hindus and the Europeans were both peoples descended from the 
same original stock. 

This leads me to Max Muller’s position and influence in the 
West. It could be expected that he would impinge on the learned 



6 SCHOLAR EXTRAORDINARY 

world, be in personal communication with front-rank scholars in 
many lines, and also that he would receive attention from men and 
women interested in things of the mind But his influence over- 
flowed into very much wider areas, and indeed they ramified beyond 
the field of scholarship into the sphere of public affairs, and beyond 
that even, as in India, into the interests of common people Among 
his friends, acquaintances, or correspondents in England alone 
were literary figures like Macaulay, Tennyson, Thackeray, Ruskm, 
Browning, Matthew Arnold, and political figures like Gladstone, 
the Duke of Argyll, Lord Northbrooke, Lord Granville, Lord 
Stratford de Radcliffe, the Marquis of Salisbury, Lord Curzon, and 
among ecclesiastical personalities there was, to mention only one 
name, Archbishop Tait This list wholly ignores the wide circles of 
his friends and acquaintances in Europe and America 

No contrast could be more striking than that between the con- 
temporary fame of Max Muller and its posthumous decline, and 
this by itself might inspire a moralizing biography to demonstrate 
the vanity of fame I would not admit that this would be more 
shallow than airing intellectual conceit towards men of the past out 
of uncritical satisfaction with the present But historically neither 
would carry us very far The reputation of Max Muller and its 
eclipse have to be correlated with his intellectual function so as to 
bring out the real significance of his life But scholars, scientists and 
historians belong to the times in which they worked, and if any new 
biographies are to be written of them these must either show what 
historical role they played in the development of the subjects they 
dealt with, or illustrate the particular incidence of a general human 
phenomenon 

A life of Max Muller can be written from both points of view Of 
course, the illustrations I have given of the kind of fame he had and 
its range do not by themselves prove the value of his researches and 
ideas To be admired in this way may be regarded as being nothing 
better than a popular fetish Some of his rivals in scholarship did at 
times rate him as nothing more important, and made the kind of 
reputation he enjoyed the ground for denying his scholarship But 
his popular fame, so far as it could be related with his specialized 
scholarship, was only the penumbra of a hard core 

One of the ironies provided by specialized learning is that though 
only a specialist can pronounce a competent judgement on a fellow- 
worker, it is rare to get a fair judgement from him. It is always

possible to find minor mistakes in the works of the greatest scholars, 
and a rival scholar can always dismiss him as worthless on the 
strength of these mistakes But Max Muller’s position and reputa- 
tion were not that of a specialized scholar, he was an intellectual 
playing a part in the mental history of his times by making people 
aware of new ideas and extending their view to new horizons His 
fame spread out from the scholarly field to the lay world like that of 
Darwin or Einstein, but with a stronger and wider impingement 
which bore practical results in some countries 

This standing becomes still more remarkable when one con- 
siders Max Muller’s own outlook on life Generally such fame as he 
had, comes only to men of action, religious, moral, or political 
preachers, 1 e , those men of ideas who provide driving power for 
action But Muller disavowed both roles His view of his own life 
was set down by him in very clear language at the very end of his 
autobiography 

I have never been a doer [he wrote in it] Many people would call 
me an idle, useless, and indolent man, and though I have not wasted 
many hours of my life, I cannot deny the charge that I have neither 
fought battles, nor helped to conquer new countries, nor joined in any 
syndicate to roll up a fortune I have been a scholar, a Stubengelehrter , 
and mild tout * Much as I admired Ruskm when I saw him with his 
spade and wheelbarrow, encouraging and helping his undergraduate 
friends to make a new road from one village to another, I never myself 
took to digging, and shovelling, and carting Nor could I agree with him, 
happy as I felt in listening to him, when he said ‘What we think, or 
what we know, or what we believe, is in the end of little consequence 
The only thing of consequence, to my mmd, is what we do 5 My view 
of life has always been the very opposite What we do, or what we 
build up, has always seemed to me of little consequence Even Nineveh 
is now a mere desert of sand, and Ruskm’s new road also has long since 
been worn away The only thing of consequence, to my mmd, is what 
we think, what we know, what we believe 

In theory, he equally rejected the role of a man of ideas as the 
priest behind the warrior 

I cannot claim [he further observed], to have been a man of action in 
the sense in which Carlyle was one in England, or Emerson in America 
They were men who in their books were constantly teaching and 
preaching ‘Do this*’ they said, ‘Do not do that*’ The Jewish prophets 



8 SCHOLAR EXTRAORDINARY 

did much the same, and they are not considered to have been useless 
men, though they did not make bricks, or fight battles like Jehu But 
the poor Stubengelehrter has not even that comfort I felt satisfied 
when my work led me to a new discovery, whether it was the dis- 
covery of a new continent of thought, or of the smallest desert island 
in the vast ocean of truth ’ 

Nothing could be more free from ambiguity None the less Max 
Muller did intervene in practical affairs, both political and social 
But as a definition of his major intellectual vocation his words were 
true, and his wide fame was based mainly, not on his involvement in 
practical questions, but on his work in the scholarly field There- 
fore his life has a bearing on a very large and important question 
Can a man who has deliberately chosen to devote himself to the 
pursuit of knowledge qua knowledge, and to ideas qua ideas, ever 
hope to make an impact on the minds of men in general? Max 
Muller’s life would show that ideas do travel from the scholar’s 
study over the wide world of the mind For this demonstration 
alone his life would be revealing 

A life of Max Muller is also justified if it can show what the 
scholarly life and the scholar’s personality really are Those who 
are not familiar with either tend to take too simple a view of both 
They assume that life runs a straight and a tranquil course whereas 
even when there is a strong sense of direction in it, it can be as 
winding as a river running to the sea Writing this life at Oxford I 
cannot forget that in order to go to London by tram I have to cross 
the Thames six times The life of an Oxford don might not be less 
winding 

As to the scholar’s personality, it is neither less complex nor less 
varied than that of poets I would even say that' scholars are more 
varied in type than are poets The Renaissance humanists were not 
less colourful than the courtesans of their times The fact is that 
scholarship is a matter of temperament As I have written in my 
autobiography ‘The greater part of the scholar’s metier is the ca- 
pacity for experiencing the emotion of scholarship Without this there 
is no genuine scholarship but only a juggling with books for the 
sake of making money in a small way, or a career of sorts ’ It is im- 
possible to understand Max Muller’s adherence to the scholarly life 
without assuming a temperamental compulsion behind it Indeed 
Max Muller, who was often regarded as a very Germanic pedant 
by those who did not know him, was looked upon even by the very 



INTRODUCTION 


9 


temperamental Oxford dons of his times as a very temperamental 
person In any case he, with all his individuality, is an example of a 
certain type of scholar-thinker, and this type recurs. Therefore it 
never loses interest or the challenge to understanding 

Last of all, the life of Max Muller as lived by him faces us with an 
absolutely fundamental question, to which I shall certainly try to 
give an answer It is this Is the life of a scholar-thinker worth 
living ? It is no use dismissing this question by taking for granted 
the scholar’s role in a civilized society Most of our incomprehension 
of life comes from not facing up to this sort of question, for dis- 
regarding Plato’s profound maxim that the unexammed life — 
anexatastos bios — is not worth living 

Just to accept the incidence of the scholarly life as a necessary 
part of civilization is hardly better than accepting motor-cars as a 
phenomenon which must be accepted Perhaps, in our age scholarly 
activities in the universities all over the world have assumed a 
character which makes scholars provide grist to a colossal mill turn- 
ing out information as consumer goods, and these multiply them- 
selves in obedience to their own Parkinson’s Law But that does not 
make an understanding, evaluation, or validation of the scholarly 
life less needed than the administrator’s life in the modem bureau- 
cracy 

So I have always put to myself the question of the basic signi- 
ficance of all lives I have seen, come in contact with, or read about 
many of the highest of my countrymen — Tagore, Gandhi 01 Nehru 
At the death of each of these men I have been terrified by the sudden 
onset of a conviction that their lives ended as ghastly tragedies and 
were not very far from that when they were living Again, at the death 
of many of my contemporaries who in their careers achieved a worldly 
success which has never come my way nor will, I have asked — What 
did they gam which I should have liked to have had and have lost ? 
In each case I had to justify their life by faith, and hardly evei by 
reasoning But for me it was impossible to avoid the question 

I have considered it in connexion with the life of European 
scholar-thinkers, and above all Karl Marx Did his ideas contribute 
anything to the undei standing of human life or to enhancing its 
value ? Or was he only the priest and propagator of a cult more 
bloody than that of our Kali or of the Aztec war god Huitzilopochtli, 
to be himself dragged to the altar of his own cult as a sacrificial 
beast fattened in the British Museum ? 



10 SCHOLAR EXTRAORDINARY 

Max Muller put forward his ideas as explanations of some of the 
deepest facts of life — religion, mythology, language Neither he 
nor anybody else has been able to say the final word on any of these 
But at all events, his theories, provisional as they were bound to be, 
touched on universal and timeless interests The question is whether 
these have that amount of relative or absolute value which makes 
any life-long pursuit of them worthwhile 

I am bound in this book to attempt an answer to this question 
But it has to come out of the book as a whole, and even then only by 
implication To close this introduction I shall set down what my 
feeling about his life has been while I have been writing this bio- 
graphy I have felt that it was as tragic in one way as it was successful 
m another This biography should bring out the grandeur et misere 
de la me savante as Alfred de Vigny’s stories brought out the 
grandeur et servitude de la vie mihtaire 

I would, of course, say that of any scholar or man of action who 
has played a part in history At many moments a man who feels 
deeply about life is seized with a conviction, terrifying though it is, 
that the significance of life and its vanity are almost equally matched 
But perhaps we should expect nothing else Significance of life 
must be found in grains after sifting the immense amount of chaff 
of insignificance which covers it The really unintelligent reaction 
is to be clever and blase, and not to be excited by the gram and 
saddened by the chaff

Friedrich Max Muller was bom on December 6, 1823, in the 
town of Dessau, now in eastern Germany, but then the capital of a 
sovereign State, though a very small one Indeed, Anhalt-Dessau 
was so small that when in the revolutionary days of mid-mneteenth- 
century Germany, a troublesome political agitator was expelled 
from the principality he threatened to break the windows of the 
ruler’s palace by throwing stones from across the border That 
would have been, not petty mischief-making, but a very appro- 
priate symbolic gesture, for the Schloss or the ducal palace was the 
focal point of the life of the whole population of the State, irrespec- 
tive of class and station The building itself was both old and im- 
posing, with a large quadrangle in front, from which staircases 
supported by turrets led up to the reception rooms The impression 
it made on Muller as a boy, he put in the mouth of the young hero 
of the only story he ever wrote 

Not far from our house, and opposite the old church with its golden 
cross, stood a large building, larger even than the church, and with 
many towers They, too, looked very grey and old, but there was no 
golden cross, only stone eagles were placed on the pinnacles, and a 
great white and blue flag waved from the highest tower, just over the 
lofty entrance where the steps went up on each side, and where two 
mounted soldiers kept guard The house had many windows, and 
through the windows could be seen red silk curtains with golden 
tassels, and all round the court stood old lime trees, which in summer 
overshadowed the grey stone walls with their green foliage, and 
strewed the grass with their fragrant white blossoms I had often 
looked up there, and at evening, when the limes smelt sweetly and the 
windows were lighted up, I saw many forms floating here and there 
like shadows, and music echoed from the palace above, and carriages 
drove m, from which men and women stepped out and hastened up 
the steps And they all looked so kind and beautiful, and the men had 
stars on their breasts, and the women had fresh flowers in their hair, 
and then I often thought, ‘Why do you not go there also ?’ 

Though Muller did not accept any identification of the Schloss 



14 SCHOLAR EXTRAORDINARY 

of his stoiy with the ducal palace at Dessau, there can be no doubt 
that the real castle inspired the description But in offering it he was 
not whipping into it any worked-up romantic feeling The account 
was truthful and natural from one who as a child saw the castle as 
the material embodiment of a historical identity — that of the little 
principality in which he was born and brought up 

This principality was the Duchy of Anhalt-Dessau In Max 
Muller’s time it was ruled by Duke Leopold Friedrich, who suc- 
ceeded to his inheritance in 1817 and did not die till 1871 Its iden- 
tity, like that of many such States in Germany, was the product of 
a long and characteristic political evolution which at the beginning 
of the nineteenth century left the country with nearly three hundred 
and fifty petty States in addition to the big ones like Prussia, 
Saxony or Bavaria Britain and France had, of course, become 
unitary and centralized politically These principalities were looked 
upon as a drag on the process of making Germany a national 
State, and with the exception of some twenty they were all swept 
away by the upheavals of the Napoleonic Wars and the reorganiza- 
tion carried out by the Congress of Vienna That brought down 
the number of States in the amorphous pan-German political 
structure from the three hundred and sixty of the Holy Roman 
Empire abolished in 1806, to the thirty-nine in the Germanic Con- 
federation created in 1815 

The Duchy of Anhalt-Dessau was among the few that survived 
the process and were recognized as constituent sovereign States of 
the Confederation But even these were considered too many and 
denounced by the champions of German umty, and more especially 
by those historians and publicists who wanted the umty to be 
brought about by Prussia But Max Muller did not share this atti- 
tude Though he too was an ardent believer in German umty and 
m some sense a supporter of the Prussian cause, he did not think 
that the small German States wholly deserved the contempt and 
ridicule with which they were treated He admitted that the eti- 
quette kept up by some of the courts and their sense of self- 
importance were at times very ludicrous, but he also asserted quite 
deliberately that without the small principalities ‘German history 
would often be quite unintelligible, and Germany would never 
have had so intense a vitality, and would never have become what it 
is now’ 

This was putting it strongly, but not uncritically. The piety that 



BEGINNINGS IN RURITANIA 15 

he felt for his native State, and gave expression to in his reminis- 
cences, did not make him blind A great majority of these States had 
indeed become completely obsolete, but those that were left intact 
by the Vienna settlement — which with the exception of the four 
Fice Cities, were all monarchical — had still left in them some of that 
vitality which had kept them alive down to the nineteenth century 
m a line of organic succession from the earliest political organization 
of the German people The Prussiamzers called these princely 
States feudalists, and in our time the world of these little kingdoms 
has been romanticized in fiction under the name of Runtama None 
of these labels were inappropriate But the reality was quite solid, 
and, though composite, it had been fused into an organic whole 

As seen in the early nineteenth century, this princely order was 
showing the latest form of the German tribal organization In these 
courts and kingdoms the power, prestige and influence of the 
princes did not depend on extent of territory or military strength, 
but on certain qualities of personality and life The whole com- 
munity from the prince to the peasant was animated by a coherent 
Volksgeist (spirit of the people) which made it favourable 
ground for that kind of cultural creation in which the individual 
personality mattered 

The Duchy of Anhalt-Dessau was a typical principality of this 
species To begin with, it had a very old dynasty whose princes held 
a distinguished record in the whole course of German history. The 
line was very old — in fact, older than the Habsburgs and the 
Hohenzollerns, and it could trace an unbroken descent from Al- 
brecht the Bear who became Margrave of Brandenburg in A D 1134 
The dynasty was called the Ascaman, which prompted some fanci- 
ful genealogists to claim its origin from Ascamus, the son of Aeneas. 
But even without any eponymous ancestor, many of these dynasties 
had lasted long enough to have become rooted in the hearts of their 
people without any reference to their personal merits 

The princes of Anhalt were, at all events, able and good men 
They never acquired large territories At their most extensive, their 
land embraced only the whole of Anhalt, but even this was split up 
from time to time owing to a curious law of succession which did not 
recognize primogeniture, but required that at the death of a father 
each of his sons would get an equal share by means of partition 
Thus, at the time of Muller’s birth, there weie three duchies of 
Anhalt — Anhalt-Dessau, Anhalt-Cothen and Anhalt-Bernburg

In actual fact, the importance of the principality as well as of the 
dynasty was due, not to territory, but to the personality of the 
princes and their achievements In the Middle Ages the Ascanians 
took an active part in the conflict between the Teuton and the Slav 
m eastern Germany At the time of the Reformation the princes of 
Anhalt were prominent champions of the Protestant cause, and 
both Luther and Melancthon paid tributes to their zeal, ability and 
piety During the Thirty Years’ War again they commanded the 
Protestant armies In the eighteenth century Leopold of Anhalt, 
famous under the name of the Alte Dessauer (Old Dessauer), was 
one of the leading generals of Prussia, and fought at Hochstadt, 
Blenheim and Malplaquet He also organized the armies of 
Frederick the Great’s father, and afterwards commanded part of 
Frederick’s forces in the War of Austrian Succession 

The personal role of the Dukes of Anhalt continued in the second 
half of the eighteenth century, when Duke Franz of Anhalt-Dessau 
became one of the most outstanding representatives of the Age of 
Enlightenment He had travelled widely in Italy, Holland and 
England, and though he had avoided France as a country dangerous 
to young German princes, he was liberal enough to erect a monu- 
ment to Rousseau in his park at Worlitz He loved England, and 
used to say that hn England one becomes a man’ There he studied 
agriculture, architecture, gardening and even manufacture, so that 
he might be able to introduce improvements in the manner of living 
of his people 

He spent his time and efforts not only in trying to improve the 
conditions of living of his subjects, for which he was loved by his 
people and called Father Franz; he also tried to inspire them with 
high ideals and to raise their mental level After seeing the English 
parks he laid out many in and around Dessau, and some of them 
were as fine as any in England In Italy he studied both ancient and 
modem art with the pioneer art critic Wmckelmann, and collected 
works of art These he arranged in his museums and palaces which 
were open to the people Like Weimar, Dessau also attracted great 
literary figures of the age — Goethe, Wieland, Lavater, Matthieson 
and many more, who came to the Duke’s palace as guests He patro- 
nized the educational reformer, von Basedow, who was the pre- 
cursor of Pestalozzi and Froebel, and gave him a home in Dessau 
when he had to leave Hamburg after a riotous mob had burnt down 
his house* Even Treitschke, the champion of Prussia, who had no

sympathy to waste on the small principalities, called Duke Franz, 
‘the honourable doyen of the house of Anhalt and a prince of im- 
perishable memory’ Not the least of the attraction of these princes 
was that they weie all tall and handsome Wmckelmann spoke of the 
visit of young Duke Franz to him as the visit of a young Greek god 
His successor, Leopold, too, was very tall and handsome 

Towards the end of Duke Franz’s rule Napoleon appeared at 
Dessau after crushing Prussia at Jena Max Muller’s mother, as a 
child of six, saw her venerable and beautiful prince standing at the 
foot of the stairs bareheaded to receive the pale and small Corsican 
Even then he was wearing the Prussian Order of the Black Eagle on 
his breast Napoleon inquired if he had sent a contingent to the 
Prussian army, and when he said that he had not, asked him why 
‘Because I was not asked,’ replied the Duke ‘But if you had been 
‘Then I should have sent my soldiers,’ said the Duke, and then he 
added, ‘Your Majesty knows the right of the stronger ’ Napoleon 
was rather pleased, and said that he would respect the neutrality of 
Dessau, provided the Duke repaired, at his expense, the bridges 
destroyed by the Prussians He even inquired further if he could 
do anything for the Duke ‘For myself,’ the Duke replied, ‘I want 
nothing I only ask for mercy for my people, for they are all like my 
children to me ’ 

Duke Leopold Friedrich, who succeeded in 1817, continued the 
traditions of Duke Franz In Anhalt-Dessau there was neither res- 
toration nor reaction It was as if the twenty-five years of upheaval, 
from 1789 to 1814, which created modern Germany, formed no 
part of the history of the principality. It lemamed untouched by 
the cunents of change which were powerful in Prussia in one way, 
and in the southern German States like Bavaria in anothei The first 
was reconstructing its political and economic organization under 
the shock of defeat, the southerners were doing so from their asso- 
ciation with Revolutionary and Napoleonic France. The rest of 
Germany was more or less stagnant. But Dessau was not stagnant, 
it remained traditional but healthy in its unchanged state It had 
both stability and tranquillity Though the old order remained in- 
tact in it there was no conscious theory either of restoration or reac- 
tion. It carried on the pre-Revolution existence of the principality 
with its benevolent despotism and spmt of Enlightenment. Duke 
Leopold was able to rule his Duchy in this manner till 1848 

Max Muller, who was born and brought up in this Dessau, 



18 SCHOLAR EXTRAORDINARY 

described the Duke as the most independent sovereign, in Europe 
He was not accountable to anybody in the exercise of his power, a 
constitution did not exist, nor was it allowed to be mentioned All 
appointments were made by him, all salaries were paid from the 
ducal chest, and whatever existed in the Duchy belonged or seemed 
to belong to the Duke There was no appeal from him He imposed 
the taxes, and if money was wanted introduced a new tax But the 
taxation was low, and, what was more remarkable, if there were 
wars or distress the taxes were actually remitted The only outside 
opinion that counted was that of the civil service of the Duchy, 
which was the custodian of the established traditions of government 
and in such a strong position that its advice, though not binding, 
could not be disregarded by the Dukes 

The Dukes were rich Not only did the Duchy belong to them 
virtually as private property, they also had properties elsewheie 
They used this wealth as much for their people as for themselves 
All the public buildings, theatres, libraries, schools, and barracks 
were erected by them, and in addition they also provided residences 
for their high officials Though formally the land belonged to them, 
most of those who had houses of their own enjoyed their property 
m freehold 

Personally, Duke Leopold was a splendid example of the best 
type of paternal ruler, just and fair, very hardworking, and acces- 
sible Besides, he was very cultivated, and his Duchess, a Prussian 
princess — a mece of Frederick William III — was equally well 
educated and cultivated Both were popular with their subjects, and 
to the common people and to the young they weie little short of a 
god and a goddess. The peasants as they caught sight of the Duke’s 
carnage shouted 'Ha Ktmmef , and the whole village gatheied 
round him 

The Duke was completely feudal in his love of hunting. The 
beautiful oak forests of the Duchy weie stocked both with deer and 
boars, and he would not allow anybody else to hunt them When he 
did, that was considered a great favour The deer came to recog- 
nize and dread his approach so much that even when they heard his 
carriage coming they scampered away, though they did not budge in 
their grazing when other carriages passed The boars destioyedthe 
crops of the peasants, who ran after his carnage asking for compen- 
sation, and he made up the losses When these amounts became too 
much the officials demurred But the Duke still compensated them

from his private funds, and asked them not to tell his ministers 

Max Muller’s relationship with the ducal family was closer than 
that of others For one thing, his father was the Duke’s librarian, 
and was held in great esteem and affection by him Secondly, his 
grandfather on his mother’s side was the Duke’s chief minister, or 
President of the Duchy He was the son of von Basedow the educa- 
tionist, and after him his son also became the chief minister of 
Dessau Even after Muller’s father had died, leaving his wife and 
two veiy young children unprovided for and in genuine poverty, 
the Duke continued to take an interest in the boy and helped the 
family As Muller became a very competent musician even as a 
boy, the Duchess would ask him to come to the Schloss and play 
duets with her on the piano When the Duke sent for him he would 
look up at him with fear and trembling, though nothing could be 
kinder than the reception of the boy by the tall and handsome old 
man, with his deep voice, slowly uttered words, and very quiet 
manner 

The landscape of the Duchy was beautiful The Elbe was not far 
away, and its tributary, the Mulde, ran by the town All around were 
magnificent forests of oak, as well as of firs, which stood in rows like 
so many grenadiers But the town, except for the ducal Schloss and 
the other palaces, had no architectural pretensions It was also very 
small, with no more than ten to twelve thousand inhabitants in 
Muller’s childhood It was still walled in, and at night the gates 
were shut The oil lamps swung across the streets, and the night 
watchmen walked along them 

It was a curious town with one long mam street running through 
it, called Cavalierstrasse This street was very long, and had pave- 
ments on both sides But so little traffic passed over it that it had to 
be weeded from time to time to get rid of the grass which came up 
through the chinks of the stones The houses generally had only 
one storey, and some of them were mere cottages Almost every 
house had a mirror fastened outside the mam window, like the 
driving mirrors of today, so that the inmates could get notice of an 
approaching visitor It was the fashion to paint the walls white, 
green, pink, or blue, and above there were waterspouts like real 
gargoyles which not only frowned on those who passed below, but 
during rainstorms poured water by the bucketful on their red and 
green umbrellas 

The population of the town was divided into two classes according 



20 SCHOLAR EXTRAORDINARY 

to Muller — the educated and the uneducated The first, without 
reckoning the princely families, consisted of the officials, the clergy, 
the school teachers, doctors, artists and the military officers, and 
the other class, of tradesmen, mechanics and labourers Trade was 
almost wholly a Jewish monopoly, and Dessau had its ghetto, for a 
former Duke who had granted them leave to settle in Dessau without 
any fear of persecution also insisted that they should live only in 
certain streets Rut the Jewish quarters in Dessau did not show the 
squalor which the ghettoes in other German towns did There was 
no particular prejudice against Jews None the less even as a boy 
Muller felt that they were only a tolerated community 

Max Muller’s classification of the population of Dessau by educa- 
tion was significant, because in the world in which he lived mental 
status was more valued than wealth In any case, nobody outside 
the ducal circle had much money None the less, the community 
of the educated in Dessau lived happily enough One thing which 
helped the peace of the town was the absence of newspapers In his 
young days at Dessau Muller knew only one, which gave nothing 
but reports of actual events on one, or half, or even quarter of a 
sheet 

The horizon of this world was narrow, but for that reason it was 
also stable Everybody performed his work honestly and conscien- 
tiously, and everybody was the keeper of his brother’s conscience 
As Max Muller says in his autobiography, ‘everybody knew every- 
body else, and every thing about everybody Everybody knew that 
he was watched, and gossip, in the best sense of the word, ruled 
supreme in the little town Gossip was, in fact, public opinion with 
all its good and all its bad features ’ The result was that no one could 
afford to lose caste, and everybody behaved as well as he could The 
society being on the whole blameless, it was all the more merciless 
towards sinners, whether the sin was small or great 

But even this small world did not impose its limitations on mental 
growth For so small a town, the education provided was as good as 
any to be had in a large German city At the beginning of the cen- 
tury the eyes of the whole of Germany, and even of Europe, were 
turned on the educational experiments carried out by von Basedow 
m the Philanthropium which he had established in Dessau The 
Dukes took great interest in education, and everything possible 
was done to keep the different schools— elementary, middle and 
high— on the highest level of efficiency Besides, in the small 6hte 



BEGINNINGS IN RURITANIA 


21 


of the town, the cultural level was very high, and there was music 
of a type which could be heard only in the great cities There was a 
first-rate theatre, both for plays and opera, and also a small but real 
intellectual circle 

The society of the educated at Dessau exhibited a mixture of 
simplicity in living with the highest kind of mental enjoyment At 
the evening parties in the house of Muller’s maternal grandfather 
there would be playing or singing of extracts from Don Giovanni or 
Fideho and readings from the latest works of Goethe or Jean Paul 
along with drinking of wine and tea In the house of his parents a 
more learned company would enjoy their Shakespeare, Dante and 
Calderon in the original languages with his mother as well as his 
father 

The Muller family were old residents of Dessau Max Muller’s 
grandfather was only a tradesman, but he was very much respected 
as such, and he was also the founder of the first lending library in 
the town Muller never saw him, nor his grandmother on the 
father’s side The old lady whom he knew as granny was his father’s 
stepmother, who was a rich widow before her second marriage. 
Muller was told that his grandfather married her for her money, so 
that he might be able to give his son a liberal education 

She grew to be very old, and when Muller and his sister, who was 
two years older, were sent to visit their grandmother they were 
terrified by her thin, white face, her piercing eyes, and her dishevelled 
clothes — all of which made them think of her as the old witch of 
German fairy-tales This notion she strengthened by telling them 
stories of ogres, ghosts and witches, which kept them awake at 
night from fear and, on Muller himself, left a very deep impression. 
She did not know her stepson at all well, and for preference she 
would talk of her own young days and of her first husband, but in 
such language that if the children repeated it at home they were 
severely scolded 

Max Muller’s father, Wilhelm Muller (1794-1827), did get his 
liberal education, and under F. A Wolf acquired enough classical 
scholarship to be able to write a book on Homer, Homensche 
Vorschule Besides being the Duke’s librarian, he was also a teacher 
m the Gymnasium of Dessau But he became more widely known, 
and even famous, as a poet Muller never claimed that his father 
was one of the great poets of Germany, and he was not. But he was 
very popular as a writer of lyrics and songs Among his best-known 



22 SCHOLAR EXTRAORDINARY 

song cycles are the still well-known and sung Schone Mullenn and 
the Wmterreise , set to music by Schubert He also wiote poems in- 
spired by the nationalism of the age in its most fiery form These 
were contained in a collection called Gnechenheder , and in them his 
love for ancient Greece mingled with his enthusiasm about the 
Greek war of independence and admiration for the heroes of this 
war These songs were at one remove an expression of his ai dent 
German nationalism Under the Mettermch System it could no 
longer be directly voiced in Germany, so it broke out in phii- 
Hellemsm The Greeks did not forget him When a monument 
was erected to him at Dessau in 1891 the Greek government of the 
day sent Pentelic marble for it. 

On his mother’s side Max Muller was connected with the highest 
in Dessau’s public service As has been already mentioned, his 
grandfather and uncle were successive presidents or chief ministers 
of the principality Another uncle was the commander-in-chief of 
the army; he had fought with the Prussians at Jena, and marched 
into Paris twice The Basedows were a handsome, high-tempered 
and imperious tribe, and when Muller was told that he took after 
his mother’s people, he was ready enough to admit it as regards 
looks, but he hoped he was not a Basedow in temper 

His mother, Adelheide von Basedow, was very beautiful, very 
small and very passionate She was very highly cultivated, and knew 
English, French and Italian perfectly She was not the Pedagogue 
Basedow’s granddaughter for nothing Goethe and old Basedow 
were friends, and the poet mentioned and praised the educationist 
in his poems But he also complained bitterly of Basedow’s never 
being without a pipe in his mouth, and of lighting it with the most 
offensive tmder, Stinkschwamm, as Goethe called it Muller’s 
mother knew that, of course, and when she and her husband went 
to see Goethe, and the latter asked what her maiden name was, she 
replied laughing 'Your Excellency ought to scent it, I am the 
granddaughter of Basedow ’ This was a very great liberty, but as she 
was young and very beautiful Goethe characteristically did not 
mind 

It was Wilhelm Muller’s personal qualities and his standing with 
the Duke which made his marriage mto the Basedow family possible 
But he and his wife were most devoted to each other, and even on 
their very small income they lived pleasantly in a house provided for 
the ducal librarian, with a pretty garden behind it This home was

23 


the rallying point of all the cultivated, scientific and artistic society 
of Dessau Wilhelm was also a most devoted father, and would 
play for hours with the children as though he were a child himself. 
These games, together with a vague picture of his father making 
him and his sister sit on his knees and telling them stories, were the 
only recollections Muller had of his father He was four years old 
when his father died at the age of only thirty-three, on October i, 
1827 

This was a sudden and terrible calamity for the family One day 
Wilhelm Muller had gone to Oranienbaum, a park near Dessau, to 
see the Duke, and returned late in high spirits In the night his wife 
woke up to find him dead by her side The death was due to para- 
lysis of the heart Adelhe^e Muller was twenty-eight, and unpro- 
vided for But more than that she felt the loss of a beloved husband. 
She remained inconsolable, and though she lived for fifty-six years 
as a widow, she never married again She would take her children 
with her when she went to her husband’s grave in the cemetery at 
Dessau, which was called Gottesacker or God’s Acre, and was 
planted with acacia trees She stood there for hours, sobbing and 
crying, and saying that she wished to die in order to be with her 
husband Her children, when they heard that, only hoped that she 
would not leave them behind but take them with her This restful 
place planted a life-long love in Max Muller for acacias But at that 
time the inscription over the gateway of the place puzzled him very 
much It ran ‘Tod 1st mcht Tod, 1st nur Veredlung Menschhcher 
Natur * — ‘Death is not death, ’tis the ennobling of man’s nature ’ 

Although Max Muller from his early childhood grew up in the 
shadow of death, he came on both sides from a stock which possessed 
great vitality and as a small boy he was full of fun and mischief. 
His mother’s old servant, Hanna, who called him Dieser infame 
jfunge , this terrible boy, and who lived to a great age, never tired of 
asking for news of her early tormentor 

After the death of her husband Frau Muller lived for some years 
with her father, and then settled herself with her children in a very 
small house, consisting of a ground floor, a storey above, and a loft 
under a high-pitched roof With that there began a life of great 
hardship for the whole family The widow had been granted a 
pension by the Duke, who had himself written to her expressing his 
sympathy, and informing her of the grant But it was only 150 
thalers (£15) a year, and from the life insurance which was 



24 SCHOLAR EXTRAORDINARY 

compulsory for a civil servant there was a little more All of it was 
quite inadequate for any kind of comfort If it had not been for the 
extreme cheapness of living at Dessau Frau Muller would not have 
been able to feed her children As for clothing, it was always thin and 
extremely well-cared for In winter there was positive suffering 
Muller often woke up to find his breath frozen on the bedsheet into 
a thin layer of ice, and he had to wash after breaking the ice in the 
ewer, which left only a few drops for use The snow-covered win- 
dows did not admit light For breakfast there was only coffee and a 
roll This hard life made Muller a sufferer from acute headaches 
throughout his early life, and from their recurrence even later It 
remained a riddle to Max Muller that his mother was able to bring 
up her children at all 

Naturally, religion was an important element in his early life Of a 
winter’s evening his mother would sit by the warm stove, and in 
candle light would read out from a book in her hand, while the 
servant woman went on turning the humming spinning- wheel • 

O Haupt voll Blut und Wunden, 

Voll Schmerz unde voller Hohn 

As he listened, the boy Muller saw the bleeding head before his 
eyes, and cried until his mother comforted him by saying that the 
sufferer was now in heaven, and it was only a song to be sung in 
church. Another experience, too, left an indelible impression on 
him. The house in which Muller lived looked into the churchyard 
of the Johannis Kirche, which in itself was not beautiful But on 
one Easter Day, it was transfigured for him — the sun had risen in 
full radiance and the old church, with its grey slate roof, the high 
wmdows and the tower with a golden cross, shone with marvellous 
brightness, and suddenly music began to come out of it When he 
asked his mother what it was, she said that it was an Easter hymn 
which they were singing in the church 

But willingly as he listened to religious readings at home, and full 
as his heart was with love towards Christ, he suffered intensely when 
taken to attend the church service Though he liked the singing, the 
sermon was a real torture, and the large church was so cold that he 
felt as if he was in an ice-cellar, and would have allowed his teeth to 
chatter if he had not been told that it was wrong to make any kind 
of noise in a church.

Music was the greatest enjoyment of his life at that age Dessau 
at the time was steeped in music The Duke kept a first-rate 
orchestra, and his Capellmeister was a composer of the old school, 
Friedrich Schneider, who was also the head of the conservatonum 
or the music school He scolded Paganini, Spohr, Sonntag and 
Mendelssohn. Apart from the general musical atmosphere, his 
mother and her sisters sang well His mother had a perfect contralto 
voice, and was often invited to sing solos at musical festivals At 
home she and Muller played a quatre, and soon he began to accom- 
pany her when she sang Hearing his mother and aunts, he could 
sing all that they sang, and was once put on the table to sing a great 
ana of Handel His parents were friends of the Webers, and also of 
Mendelssohn who once took the boy Muller on his knees as he was 
playing the organ in the Grosse Kirche and made him play the 
choral, while he himself played the pedal 

Muller’s formal musical education began very early, but it began 
secretly He was five years old, and his mother was staying with her 
father The neighbour on the right-hand side of the house took 
lodgers, and one of his lodgers was an ex-theology student, now 
studying music and taking lessons from Schneider He often talked 
to Muller across the hedge He had noted the child’s love of music, 
and one day, lifting him over the hedge, he took him to his room and 
asked him if he would like to play the piano When Muller agreed 
with eagerness, he said that he would teach him for half an hour 
every day, provided he told nobody, not even his mother So Muller 
had his lessons for about six months, keeping it quite secret He at 
last sat down to the piano in his grandfather’s salon, and to the 
amazement of everybody played some easy pieces from Mozart 
and Diabelh. The young man, whose name was Kahle, was at once 
formally engaged to be Max’s music teacher, and he charged sixpence 
for a lesson. Muller made very quick progress 

Young Max was, of course, sent to school, first to the elementary 
school and after that to the higher one His school work, which at 
the higher level included elements of Latin and Greek, was not 
heavy The teachers were very conscientious, and though they 
taught well they did not make the life of their pupils a burden. 
Muller’s record was good at school, but in no way very outstanding. 
His musical interest and his constant headaches interfered with his 
work in school. 

At this stage it was a young teacher who first told Max Muller 



26 SCHOLAR EXTRAORDINARY 

that he ought to be worthy of his father— an idea which had never 
before entered his mind, for he was not old enough when his father 
died to have any correct idea of his literary eminence This teacher, 
a Dr Homcke, had an attractive appearance, though there was a very 
sad air about him, due to the fact that he knew he was dying of con- 
sumption Besides, he was a liberal and was politically persecuted 
He died soon after Muller had left Dessau, but Homcke’s sugges- 
tion that he should remember what he owed to his father, and the 
feeling of piety that went with it became strong influences on the 
boy’s life 

Max Muller’s headaches often made him lose two or three days a 
week in his lessons, for he felt as if the skm of his forehead was peel- 
ing off and he had to he down and try to sleep Yet he had to do his 
work, even though he did it carelessly, and in consequence was 
scolded and punished Finally, when all remedies had failed, he was 
sent to the famous founder of homoeopathy, Hahnemann, who had 
taken refuge in the Duchy of Anhalt- Cothen, and from there visited 
Dessau as a consulting physician Hahnemann was a very imposing 
personality, a powerful man with a gigantic head and strong eyes, 
and a most persuasive voice He made the boy Muller swallow a good 
many of his globules, but did not succeed in curing him, and it was 
not till i860 that he was finally cured of his migraine at Oxford 

Max Muller visited his grandfather Basedow’s house as a matter 
of course But the old president did not have much time to attend 
to the children in the family, and in any case he made no secret of 
his preference for his son’s son So when his cousin was taken out 
by his grandfather to shoot with him, and came back with a hare, 
Muller felt somewhat jealous But he was soon cured of that jealousy, 
for one day he was also taken out to shoot, and his grandfather, who 
could not see very well, shot a doe with two young fawns. The death 
cries of the mother, and the whimperings of distress of the young 
ones, which kept trying to suckle their dead mother, horrified 
Muller, and he made a vow never again to go out shooting or to kill 
an animal This vow he kept, though he was laughed at for it 

Once, when he was twelve, Muller’s mother went with some 
friends for a holiday to Heligoland, leaving her son with her 
mother, the Frau President The reports of the old lady to her 
daughter of her grandson’s doings showed that he did have his due 
share of being spoilt by grandparents, at all events by his grand- 
mother.

We shall miss him very much [wrote the old lady] when he leaves us 
He has become quite one of us You would be amused to see him 
smoking a pipe with his grandfather, he can also take a pinch of snuff, 
and he does not refuse a taste of liqueur The father has a very quiet 
horse on which he can ride alone, so you will find him quite a grown-up 
man in all the fine arts His trousers indeed have a very variegated 
appearance from cherries, bilberries, and ink, but a young man does 
not think much of that 


Soon after his grandfather, President Basedow, died Muller was 
twelve, and his mother thought that it would be better for him to be 
with other boys and under the supervision of a man He had been 
spoilt by her love, and also by her severity in punishing him So, 
after having risen from form to form in the school at Dessau, he was 
sent to the famous Nicolai School at Leipzig That was at Easter 
1836 

For the next eight years Max Muller lived at Leipzig, taking five 
years to finish his school education, two and a half to obtain his 
doctorate from the University of Leipzig, and spending about six 
months in literary work and exploring openings for a career During 
the last three of these his mother and sister came over from Dessau, 
and they lived together in order to economize and also to enable 
Muller to live in greater freedom and comfort. But during the 
school years he was separated from his mother, and much as both 
wished to meet each other he could not always afford to go home as 
frequently as he wanted The distance was only thirty-five miles and 
the journey by coach cost only one thaler (approximately three 
shillings) To save even that Muller at times walked home all the 
way, and in the last lap felt so tired and cramped and stiff in the 
legs that he sat by the roadside and rested before he actually en- 
tered the town So, the agonizing separation between a fatherless 
only son and a widowed mother, both of whom passionately loved 
each other, began for Muller at the age of twelve, and lasted for 
forty-seven years During the whole of this period he wrote regu- 
larly to his mother, and every letter was preserved by her Bound in 
five volumes they are now in the Bodleian 

The extraordinary thing was that even as a boy he unconsciously 
assumed a role of guardianship over his mother, and as he grew 
older it became quite conscious, of course The following letter was 
written when Muller was just short of thirteen.

My dear good mother — Today for the first time, I have to be far 
away from you on your birthday, and you can fancy how sorry I am I 
think it grieves you too, little mother, for I know your love for me Oh, 
how I long to be with you, only for a moment, only to press you in my 
arms, only to tell you how I love you but it cannot be Your birthday 
is always doubly dear to me, first because it is your birthday, and then 
because it was the first day that you roused yourself again from your 
sorrow, to which just in these weeks of the year you gave way more 
than usually [Wilhelm Muller died on October i, and her birthday 
was October 12 ] You were right to grieve, and it would not have been 
proper to try to console and amuse you You must have sorrowed this 
year more than usual, as the birthday of our good grandfather was this 
week [The first birthday after his death in 1835 ] But I will not write 
more about this, it will but renew your sorrow I will only say that God 
has replaced something of what you have lost, in giving you two beings 
who love you as no others do You best know whom I mean Your Max 

When at school in Leipzig Muller lived with a friend of the 
family, Professor Cams, whose son, Victor, was the same age as he 
was The Professor would not accept any money, nor could Muller's 
mother offer any He was treated as a son of the family, and the two 
boys slept in the same room, worked together and had everything 
m common. They remained friends all their life Frau Cams, who 
took care of him like a mother, was called Xante (Aunt) by Muller 
The house had a large garden, and it was also an orthopaedic insti- 
tution for girls About thirty of them were either boarders or 
attended daily Their joyful company made the place pleasant. 

The Nicolai School, into which Muller had secured admission, 
was one of two famous schools in Leipzig, and when the boys of the 
schools met, their rivalry often showed itself in blows. These Ger- 
man public schools were not residential, the boys lived at home and 
spent about six hours at school. Therefore the influence of the 
teachers on the boys was less continuous than in English schools. 
Also, they were mixed in their social affiliations The son of a 
minister and the son of a well-to-do butcher or blacksmith had to 
sit together, and the more delicate boys were exposed to bullying 
by their rough and muscular school-fellows. Max Muller however, 
was well able to hold his own both at Dessau and at Leipzig, and 
many of his masters, who knew his father, took a personal interest 
m him 

The emphasis in teaching was almost overwhelmingly on the 



BEGINNINGS IN RURITANIA 29 

classics, and the grounding given in both Greek and Latin was very 
thorough In the higher forms the boys were expected to speak 
Latin fluently, and Muller when he left school did so easily Modern 
languages, mathematics and science were looked upon as poor rela- 
tions, and the boys, who were aware of the relative prestige of the 
subjects, often absented themselves from the science classes 

Therefore, as was only to be expected, the headmaster was a well- 
known classical scholar, Dr Nobbe, whose edition of Cicero was 
used even in England Another teacher was a specialist in ancient 
geography, one an annotator of Demosthenes, and yet another a 
Greek lexicographer Max Muller became very proficient in Greek 
as well as Latin But being the son of a German poet and a reader of 
contemporary German literature, and too young to appreciate the 
kind of greatness the classics had as literature, he could not help 
feeling that, compared with the great German writers of the day, 
the Greek and Latin poets were somewhat overpraised 

He did well at school and often carried off prizes, to which at 
times a warning was attached that he ought not to become con- 
ceited on account of them At that stage he wrote poems, and some 
of them were read on important occasions In 1839 three hundred 
years had passed since Luther had preached in the church of St 
Nicolai at Leipzig, and for the tercentenary celebrations in the city 
a poem of Muller’s was selected for him to recite before a large 
audience He was only sixteen, and went through it with fear and 
trembling 

But good as he was at bookwork, his most active interest at Leip- 
zig was music By that time he could hum all the arias and sympho- 
nies of Beethoven, He was asked at times to play at the houses of 
friends But his most memorable experiences were of listening to the 
most famous musicians and composers of the day From 1835 t0 
1843, during the whole period of Muller’s stay in Leipzig, Mendels- 
sohn was conductor and director of the Gewandhaus concerts in the 
city. Though only twenty-six at the time of his appointment, he 
was already famous, and he made Leipzig the musical capital of the 
country. So Max Muller was able to hear the most distinguished 
artists and composers of his time Moreover, on account of his in- 
timacy with Mendelssohn, he was actually invited to many per- 
formances, sometimes to listen, and at other times to take part in 
them. 

Professor Cams was himself very musical, and his wife sang 



30 SCHOLAR EXTRAORDINARY 

beautifully His son, Victor, played the violin, and Max the piano 
and also sang Many celebrities of the musical world came to his 
house One evening Muller got the autographs of five of them on a 
slip of paper which he kept till the end of his life They were Men- 
delssohn, Liszt, Kalliwoda (violinist, composer, conductor), David 
(violist), Hiller (conductor and composer) 

Soon after his arrival in Leipzig as a boy of thirteen, he was in- 
vited to the house of Mendelssohn, and there he found not only his 
host, but his host’s sister, Fanny, and her husband the painter 
Hensel, besides David and the pianist Dreyschock He walked in 
bravely, and was received with the utmost kindness 

Young Muller sent a report of the evening’s experience to his 
mother, and showed remarkable maturity in his appreciation of the 
performance, Dreyschock’s playing on the piano 

Mendelssohn [he wrote] stood close to the piano, and I sat where I 
could watch Dreyschock with great comfort He is still the first of the 
pianists, and quite a young man He played here last winter, and was 
taken for Thalberg He played marvellously, so that Mendelssohn 
wondered at his skill, though he [Mendelssohn] immediately after- 
wards played an imitation of Dreyschock’s composition I must say, I 
much prefer Mendelssohn, even if the other has more skill, particu- 
larly in octave playing, in which he is decidedly the first of artists 

Later, Muller also heard Thalberg, and wrote to his mother ‘Now 
I have heard Thalberg It is indescribable I am still enchanted 
by it there can be nothing else like it He is quite young, handsome, 
and very distinguished looking, beautiful hands and such skill, 
execution, and power ’ 

Max Muller also saw the first entry of Liszt into Geimany after 
his triumphal tours in France and elsewhere In March 1840 this 
blazing meteor struck Leipzig, and both dazzled and repelled the 
musical Leipzigers. He was only twenty-eight, very theatrical and 
immensely attractive to women. His style of playing was quite new 
then, and many lovers of music who heard him for the first time 
were repelled by the flamboyance both of his playing and of his 
appearance and manners. At one concert he came in Magyar cos- 
tume, and the ladies offered him a golden chaplet of laurel and a 
sword Max Muller went to three of his concerts, one of them public 
for which he bought a ticket, and the other two at Mendelssohn’s 
invitation

31 


The public concert was advertised long before Liszt’s coming, 
but when he heard that tickets had been sold at one thaler (three 
shillings) he was very annoyed and decided that he would play 
only part of the programme The house was crowded, but when 
he appeared there was a terrible hissing, and Liszt glared like a 
demon at the audience However, when he began to play there was 
thunderous applause There was more hissing later at his manager, 
who was really responsible for the arrangements The next day it 
was advertised that the full original programme would be played, 
but as it was higher priced only fifty tickets were sold, and Liszt 
showed his displeasure by pretending to be ill and not going at all 
Though many of those who heard him were dazzled by his playing, 
Leipzig as a whole was not pleased with the new musical genius 
Even young Max felt that his technique was a little mechanical, 
though of the highest perfection 

Mendelssohn, however, was delighted with Liszt, and with his 
usual generosity arranged two concerts for him — one a musical 
soiree and the other a musical matinee At the soiree, to which four 
hundred people came, Muller was invited because he was one of 
the tenors in the chorus which was to sing an oratorio 

At the matinee, at which many famous musicians of the day were 
present, Liszt appeared in Hungarian costume, wild and magni- 
ficent, and told Mendelssohn that he was going to play something 
specially written for him Then, sitting down and swaying right and 
left on the music stool, he played fiist a Hungarian melody and then 
three or four variations, each to Muller, more incredible than the 
last 

Those who heard were amazed, and all paid compliments to the 
hero of the day. Mendelssohn’s friends gathered round him and 
said 4 Ah, Felix, now we can pack up — (jetzt konnen wir einpacken ) 
No one else could do that, it’s all over with ust’ Liszt then came up 
and asked Mendelssohn to play something, and the latter laughed 
and said that he hardly played any more Liszt, however, would not 
take a refusal, and so at last Mendelssohn said playfully "Well, I’ll 
play, but you must promise not to be angry ’ Then he sat down and 
played the whole of Liszt’s Hungarian melody, and after that all 
the variations He even imitated Liszt’s movements and raptures, 
and the audience was a little afraid that the guest might take offence. 
But when it was over Liszt laughed, applauded and observed that 
no one, not even he, could execute such a bravura.

At Leipzig Muller also saw another musical genius, soon to be 
recognized as great He was Robert Schumann, then poor and 
striving for recognition, and engaged in an almost public struggle 
with the father of Clara Wieck, whom he loved and wanted to 
marry Max Muller did not see much of Schumann in later life, 
and he recollected him only as a young man generally sitting in a 
comer of the orchestra listening to one of his works being per- 
formed under Mendelssohn’s direction He remembered his very 
large head and his drooping eyes, and that he smiled but rarely 
Max Muller completed his school education early in 1841, but for 
his final or abitunenten examination he had to go to Zerbst in 
Anhalt, so that if he passed he might qualify for a scholarship from 
Dessau, without which he could hardly go to university He passed 
and got his scholarship , it was only £ 6 , but it was an important help 
to him Before the examination his headmaster, Dr Nobbe, wrote 
to his mother ‘I rejoice that I can see him leave this school with 
testimonials of moral excellence not often found in one of his years, 
possessed of knowledge first rate in more than one subject , and with 
intellectual capacities excellent throughout May this young mind 
develop more and more, and may the fruits of his labours be here- 
after a comfort to his mother for the sorrows and cares of the past ’ 
After Muller’s death in 1900, at a gathering held in the memory 
of the old boys of the Nicolai School, the Director ended his refer- 
ence to him with the words £ He was without any doubt, next to 
Leibmtz, one of the greatest of our pupils ’ 

Before he left the house of Professor Cams, Muller recalled the 
letter to his mother in which he had sent her birthday greetings, and 
looked forward to the next stage of his life He wrote 

When I remember the time when I first sent you my birthday 
greetings from Leipzig, and now see that this period of life is nearly 
over, I must gratefully acknowledge how good God has been to us in 
various ways, and has given us many compensations But above all, 
how grateful we should be that God has preserved you, our dear mother, 
to us, to sweeten for us all that is bitter, to reward all effort. How I 
rejoice over next year, in which a new existence opens for me, a higher 
aim in life floats before me, and I shall have you both [his mother and 
sister] with me I cannot tell you how I rejoice at the thought of this 
time, when I must take another step forwards, and shall again, at all 
events for a time, be with my own people 

He was then just over seventeen*

Max Muller joined Leipzig University in the summer term of 
1841, and left with a doctorate in September 1843, ^at is to say, 
after spending less than eighteen months there, and before he had 
completed his twentieth year That was, by our standards, a very 
short period for going through university disciplines, but perhaps 
the length of the process did not, in his case, matter so much as its 
intensity The University of Leipzig for long had a very high reputa- 
tion in Europe, and was looked upon, if not as the first, certainly 
among the best Other universities had come up in the early part of 
the nineteenth century, but even so the standing of Leipzig was 
very high 

The German universities were quite different from English uni- 
versities in their teaching methods, and in them professors had a 
status and prestige which they never acquired at Oxford or 
Cambridge It was they who imparted university education, and 
not the tutors, and they expounded the subjects without supervising 
the work of the students Personal attention was given only to those 
students who became members of seminars or societies, to which 
admission was obtained by submitting essays As to lectures, the 
young men were left to choose whatever they liked, and the variety 
as well as interest of the subjects was so great that the students had 
great difficulty in choosing what lectures they would attend, and 
on what subjects they should concentrate Thus what a student 
might get out of his university depended more on himself than on 
his teachers Max Muller exercised the freedom to widen his read- 
ing, but he also knew how to concentrate, and since he was a mem- 
ber of two societies concerned with Greek and Latin he received 
some personal guidance and advice In addition, he sampled an 
enormous number of subjects of which he had known nothing at 
school, and as a result during his stay at the university his mind 
passed from one stage of formation to another, which in a very 
German fashion I might describe as "passing fiom a state of being 
to one of becoming 

The growth of his mind till it was ripe enough to realize its 
potential, and of his character till it had acquired its individuality, 
will be traced in a later chapter Here only the external events and 
the incidental activities of his life in Leipzig University have to be 
set down and these latter were not at all like the so-called extra- 
curricular activities of modem universities At Leipzig the univer- 
sity authorities did not have anything to do with them, neither 



34 SCHOLAR EXTRAORDINARY 

organizing nor supervising in any way, they were in fact part of the 
private life of each student, and the most noticeable feature was 
their freedom In regard to student discipline, the German univer- 
sities of those days differed radically from the German schools of 
the same period They gave as much freedom as the schools imposed 
discipline and supervised conduct So young German university 
students, when they moved from the strict control by the schools 
to the unrestricted freedom of the universities, fully exercised and 
thoroughly enjoyed their freedom They gave immediate expression 
to it in their pranks which as Max Muller said later, would have 
brought them into conflict with the university authorities if indulged 
m at Oxford or Cambridge 

Then there were duels, which though illegal, were connived at 
by the university, unless they resulted in serious wounds or death, 
and they were universal The university itself had a fencing school, 
the Fechtboden , to which Muller went During his university days 
he fought three duels, wounds from two of which left him with 
permanent scars One was fought to defend the scholarly standing 
of Professor Hermann who taught the classics Muller was listening 
to one of his lectures, when a student sitting at the table made some 
disrespectful remark about the Professor He asked the youth to 
be quiet, and when he went on with his foolish remarks Muller 
stopped him by calling him out It was obligatory on any German 
university student to cease from any further provocation when once 
challenged 

In the duels the accepted etiquette with seconds was strictly 
observed The most usual weapon was the sword, but theological 
students preferred pistols because they could not easily get a living 
if their faces were scarred However, the last thing a German student 
desired was to kill his adversary, and though in Max Muller’s time 
there were four hundred duels in one year, only two fatal accidents 
happened, and, as he obseived in his autobiography, that could 
happen even at football. A beautiful wood near the city was the 
usual rendezvous of the duellers, and there was a small river close 
by to enable the duellers to escape if the police arrived after hearing 
any report. Formally, duels were forbidden and punished, but un- 
less something serious happened the punishment for mere duelling 
never went beyond loss of the club uniform and flag, of the arms, 
and of the barrels of beer. 

When Muller went to the duelling ground to defend the reputa- 



BEGINNINGS IN RURITANIA 35 

tion of his Professor of Greek, there were thirty or forty other 
couples ready to fight their duels, and there was a throng of spec- 
tators— of course, students— gaily attired in their club uniforms, 
with beer barrels pushed up on one side, and the surgeon with his 
instruments, waiting Many of the combatants came on horseback 
or even in their carnages 

In spite of all his effort to remain calm and unconcerned, Muller 
could not help being nervous before his first duel, and he saw him- 
self being carried severely wounded or even killed to a house where 
his mother and sister would be waiting for him But everything went 
off well, and after the duel he and his friends enjoyed a good breakfast 

Though in his autobiography, written almost at the end of his 
life, Max Muller said that duels could never be defended, it was 
remarkable that even at that age, he should justify them, at least for 
German students In the German universities, he said, the society of 
students was very mixed and perfect equality reigned among them 
— all of them addressed one another with the ‘Thou* (Du) So a 
gentleman's son required some kind of protection against the son of 
a butcher or of a day-labourer. Crude fighting with hands was 
entirely forbidden among German students, so that there remained 
nothing to a student who wanted to escape from being insulted by a 
young ruffian but to call him out Muller deliberately set down the 
view ‘Of course, duels can never be defended, but for keeping up 
good manners, also for bringing out a man’s character, these aca- 
demic duels seem useful However small the danger is, it frightens 
the cowaid and restrains the poltroon * Still, he hoped for a time 
when it would be possible for men to defend their honour without 
recouise to sword or pistol 

Of social life in the oidinary sense of the word Muller had very 
little during his university days He would not even have an evening 
suit made But he joined a student club which formed part of the 
famous German Burschenschaft or Students’ Association which 
played such an important part in the war of liberation against 
Napoleon, but which on account of its political associations had to 
go under the name of Gemeinschaft under the Mettermch System. 
To his club he went to smoke and drink beer, and there he acquired 
a numbei of friends Some of his acquaintances resented the loss of 
political freedom, and were ready for any wild scheme in order to 
have Germany united and respected abroad and to establish con- 
stitutional government at home. Being very young Mullei generally 



36 SCHOLAR EXTRAORDINARY 

kept aloof while his older friends talked of their plans pour culbuter 
toute I’Europe, and he followed the rodomontades with the shrewd 
bright face of a squirrel 

But that did not prevent his being locked up in prison for two 
days by the police for wearing the ribbon of a club which lay under 
their suspicion His friends were however allowed to visit him and 
to smoke and drink beer with him What he really dreaded as a 
consequence of this escapade was the loss of his stipend without 
which he could not continue his studies at Leipzig, and scholarships 
were forfeit for political offences So after his release he saw the 
Rector of the university and explained the circumstances of his 
im prisonment — how he had been arrested simply because he was a 
member of a club which was suspect to the police He assured the 
Rector that he was not involved in any political agitation or propa- 
ganda The old gentleman relieved Muller by saying ‘I have heard 
nothing about this , and if I do, how am I to know that it refers to 
you, for there are many Mullers in the university ?’ 

If Max Muller’s principal recreation in his school days was 
music, at the university it became literatuie, and more especially 
poetry From time to time he fancied he would become a poet, 
which was not unnatural in the son of a poet He became an active 
member of a literary society formed by like-minded fellow-students 
It was called ‘The Elegant World’, or ‘The Elegant’ for short Two 
of its members became literary figures in later life — Wolfssohn as a 
poet and Theodor Fontane as a very popular and widely read 
novelist and a minor poet But none of these aspirants could at the 
time imagine themselves to be destined for real greatness 

Max Muller appeared for his doctorate earlier than he had in- 
tended, in September 1843, and as he was not sure of success he did 
not inform his mother for fear of disappointing her But he passed 
with ease, received his doctorate in a borrowed dress-suit, and got 
his cards printed with ‘Dr Max Muller’ — and placed them himself 
on his mothei’s lap. During the years she lived with him she never 
interfered with his full freedom, and yet she loved him passionately 
as he also loved her After her death her feeling for the relationship 
was found set down on a scrap of paper in words which she had 
copied from some English book ‘The tie of mother and son, of 
widowed mother and only son, the tie unlike all others in the 
world, not only in its blessedness, but in its divine compensation.’ 
"None the less, she had realized what few mothers or wives do, that 



37 


BEGINNINGS IN RURITANIA 

love which at its best and strongest obliterates the separateness 
of selves, cannot also exist without respecting the freedom of each 
self 

The last months of Max Muller’s stay at Leipzig were devoted to 
two htciary projects, the publication of a new edition of his father’s 
Gnechenheder , and of his own translation of the Sanskrit Httopadesa, 
a collection of moral fables To Leipzig society he remained, as he 
informed his friend, Fontane, incognito because he had paid all his 
farewell visits and felt no inclination for society To the new edition 
of his father’s lyrics of ancient and modern Greece, he added a few 
new poems and the hymn to Raphael Riego, the Spanish revolu- 
tionary He also wiote a preface to the new edition, showing the 
poems in relation to the reaction against all liberal movements which 
had followed In writing this, his object was to excite a feeling of 
contempt for those who had betrayed the struggle for liberty of a 
whole people But in the political conditions of the times — five 
years were still to go before the suppressed revolutionary feeling 
was to buist out in 1848 — it could not be printed Max Muller told 
his friend Fontane that he was very annoyed, but he also observed 
philosophically ‘You sec there is nothing left but to avoid all living 
subjective topics, and take refuge in the objective past ’ So he added. 
‘I have picked out a work from hoary antiquity and my first opus 
will soon appear, a German translation of the oldest Indian collec- 
tion of fables You will find many acquaintances of childhood’s 
days, from Gellert, La Fontaine, etc , and the interesting thing is 
that one can follow the wanderings of these fables, through twenty 
different languages, from the oldest to most recent times ’ This 
book Muller dedicated to his Professor of Sanskrit, Brockhaus 


### WANDERINGS OF YOUNG MAX MULLER
Chapter 2 

WANDERINGS OF YOUNG MAX MULLER 

Everything in Max Muller’s social antecedents, taken with his 
education which was typical for a young German of his birth and 
times, destined him for the career of an official or teacher But he 
exercised his own choice and launched himself into a vocation 
which, despite the feeling of uncertainty and groping he felt for 
many years, inevitably made him "the Erasmus of the nineteenth 
century Nevertheless the very first plan for settling him in the 
world envisaged an official’s life for him He was offered a position 
in the Austrian diplomatic service 

The source of the offer was romantic His mother had a cousin 
with whom the brother of the reigning Duke of Anhalt-Dessau, 
Prince Wilhelm, fell in love There was naturally a great outcry in 
the Ruritanian circle, but the Prince would not give up his love, and 
finally he was allowed to marry her morganatically However, she 
was raised from the position of a commoner by being made Baroness 
Stolzenberg, though to Muller she always remained Cousin Emilie 
This lady had as her childhood’s companion a mysterious individual 
who became known as Baron Hagedorn Nobody knew who his 
parents were His mother had given birth to him in a forester’s 
cottage near Dessau, and disappeared for ever He was brought to 
the house of Muller’s mother’s aunt, Frau Klausmtzer, and lived 
in her family as a schoolboy Thus he and Emilie became play- 
fellows Hagedorn never did anything, but was never in want of 
money Large sums were paid annually for his maintenance by a 
Frankfurt banker. 

So his mam activity was to wander about Europe, and stay in the 
great capitals where he had comfortable apartments He had a large 
country house near Munich, and a prettily furnished flat in Rue 
Royale, opposite La Madeleine, though au cmqmeme . Once he took 
Max Muller on a tour of Germany 

Muller had not as yet taken his doctorate when Cousin Emilie 
and Hagedorn devised their joint plan for him He was to join the 
Oriental Academy in Vienna, in order to qualify for the Austrian 
diplomatic service by learning some Oriental languages As Cousin 



WANDERINGS OF YOUNG MAX MULLER 39 

Emilie and her husband the Prince were childless, they wanted to 
adopt him and give him a new name and also a title Furthermore, 
they offered to find a wife for him Max Muller shook his head, and 
without hesitation declined all the honours, he wanted to re main 
independent and true to his first love, Sanskrit All the decisive 
turns in his life were unexpected, almost accidental, but there did 
appear to be an inevitability in all that happened to him 

To begin with, Max Muller himself decided to go to Berlin and 
join the university there His object was partly to hear Franz Bopp, 
author of Comparative Grammar and the most eminent philologist 
of his age, and partly to study philosophy under Schelling He also 
wanted to examine the Sanskrit manuscripts which the King of 
Prussia had just bought from the executors of Robert Chambers, 
an English Orientalist Muller’s sister had been married in February 
1844 to Dr Krug, a physician and son of the well-known philo- 
sopher, and they proposed to live at Chemnitz His own financial 
position was not such that he could take his mother with him to 
Berlin, and so it was decided that she should go and live with her 
daughter and son-in-law 

But even for himself Max Muller’s finances were not adequate. 
The scholarship of forty thalers (= £ 6 ) which he held was to last 
only one more year, and at his majority in 1844 his mother’s pension 
was going to be reduced from £ 1 5 a year to half that amount There- 
fore on his way to Berlin he stopped at Dessau in order to find out 
if he could obtain a grant from the Stipendium founded by Duke 
Leopold for poor scholars But no one gave him any hope The 
Duke and Duchess expressed a desne to see him, and he explained 
his position, but there was no practical result He then went to the 
family friend, Advocate Richter From him, too, he could get no 
hope At last he resolved to help himself, drew fifty thalers ( = ^7.50) 
from his savings bank, and started for Berlin 

He arrived there at the beginning of April, and at first stayed in 
the house of relatives, his uncle and Aunt Hake, who said that he 
could stay with them as long as he liked He gratefully accepted the 
offer, but began to look for lodgings at once. He wanted a really 
nice room, and informed his mother that in two days he had seen 
forty, and was dead tired. He explained that he could not pay any 
visits until he was settled, but added in despair: ‘But when will that 
be ? ’ However, in two days he found a room very near the Unter den 
Linden, becoming the lodger of a cobbler. He paid 18 shillings a 



40 SCHOLAR EXTRAORDINARY 

month for the room, service and cleaning of boots, and found the 
people of the house to be clean and respectable 

Rut the cobbler's workshop was next to his room, and the beating 
of leather went on all day long and tried his patience very much 
However, the room was on the third floor and commanded a wonder- 
ful view To look at it was a solace to him, and he held out against 
the noise 

In Berlin he had access to influential persons Though the 
Duchess could not help him about money, she had given him an 
introduction to Alexander von Humboldt More significantly, she 
asked him to see Ruckert, the famous poet and Orientalist Max 
Muller's father and he were friends, and Muller himself was very 
fond of Ruckert's poetry, which he had read since boyhood But he 
had a fair warning that the man might be different from the poet 
Before he left Dessau the Duchess told him ‘When you go to Berlin 
you must see Ruckert, but don’t be frightened ' 

Max Muller found Ruckert to be the broad-shouldered giant 
described to him, and, besides when he went to see the poet, he was 
m his dressmg-gown, with his hair parted in the middle and hanging 
wildly about his temples The opening of the acquaintance did not 
promise well When Max Muller requested the professor to enrol 
him for the lectures on the Persian poet Saadi and his Guhstan , he 
was asked ‘Why do you want to learn Persian He humbly ex- 
plained his reason, but Ruckert observed ‘It is no use your learning 
Persian unless you know Arabic ' Muller said that he had studied 
Arabic for a year under Professor Fleischer at Leipzig But the 
real reason for Ruckert’s unwillingness was that he was anxious to 
get away from Berlin to his country place, Neusses, near Coburg, 
if only he could find a good excuse for not lecturing to give to the 
Minister of Education, who grumbled at his absences So he said 
to Muller ‘You know tres faciunt collegium ’ (without three there 
cannot be a class), and he added, ‘I cannot lecture for one ’ Muller 
went away to find two more listeners, and came back with them, 
making up the required three All of them said to the professor 
that they were most anxious to learn Persian. One of them really 
wanted to learn the language, and indeed subsequently became a 
great scholar, the other was only a makeweight Seeing no way out, 
Ruckert agreed to remain in Berlin and give his lectures. 

Nevertheless, when lecturing he told them that he had for- 
gotten his Persian, and confessed. ‘I cannot teach you Persian. 



WANDERINGS OF YOUNG MAX MULLER 41 

I can only show you how to learn it I learned everything by 
myself, and so can you We will work together, but that is all I 
can do ’ 

Muller found that Ruckert’s informal teaching was more useful 
than that of many learned professors who year after year read the 
same lectures to admiring audiences Ruckert was extremely adven- 
turous in his linguistic excursions Nobody in Germany in those 
days thought of learning Tamil, but he showed Muller a large 
treatise on Tamil which he had himself copied and amended He 
also studied Chinese, and was fairly advanced in Sanskrit and Zend 
According to Max Muller, the secret of success of the German pro- 
fessors was that they took their pupils into the worshops and did not 
keep them standing and gaping at the show window Something like 
the tutorial teaching at Oxford and Cambridge was given by the 
German professors in the seminars and societies, where the 
students were shown how to work rather than simply crammed for 
examinations Afterwards Ruckert learned that Max was the son 
of his friend Wilhelm Muller, and he became very friendly to 
him Treated with cordiality and admitted to intimacy, Max 
Muller felt that it was a privilege to know him 

Max Muller’s acquaintance with Bopp was not so fruitful He 
received Muller most kindly, but was very infirm though only fifty- 
three yeais old In his lectures he simply read his Comparative 
Grammar with a magnifying glass, and added very little that was 
new He lent some Latm manuscripts to Muller, but could not help 
him with the really difficult passages This at first surprised Muller, 
for he had assumed that every professor was omniscient Then he 
realized that even at fifty-three a scholar might foiget many things 
he had known 

He paid more attention to Schelhng, and attended his course of 
lectures more diligently He saw the philosopher as soon as he 
could after his arrival in Berlin, and sent an account of the first 
meeting to his mother. Muller was an obscure student not yet 
twenty-one, and the other was a famous philosopher of sixty-mne. 
He had heard that Schelhng also could be abrupt with his visitors. 
But he was received kindly, and when after the preliminary talk 
about his lectures and Muller’s own interests the subject of Indian 
philosophy came up, the eminent elder allowed the younger man 
to tell him a good deal Muller dwelt especially on the likeness be- 
tween the Samkhya system of Hindu philosophy and Schellmg’s 



42 SCHOLAR EXTRAORDINARY 

own system, and remarked how an inclination to Vedanta also 
showed itself , 

Schelhng asked him more about this He was specially interested 
m knowing what the Vedanta said about the existence of God, how 
it proved His existence, whether it said that God had created the 
world, and also whether it said that the world had any reality He 
was at that time very much occupied with the essays of the English 
Orientalist Colebrooke, and wanted to learn more, even asking 
Muller if he could explain a text At last he inquired where Muller 
lived, told him that he had known his father as a poet who had 
written on Greece and worked on Homer, and dismissed him with 
a cordial 4 Come again soon* Muller attended Schelhng’s lectures, 
and even translated a portion of one of the Upanishads for him 
The first few months of Mullet’s stay in Berlin were very pleasant 
socially. His connexions, the Hakes and the Krugeis, regularly 
asked him to meals, and as his friend he had Fontane, once a fellow- 
student at Leipzig He met his teachers from time to time, and even 
visited Bettina von Armm, one of the Egenas of the Romantics 
But his closest friends were the Hensels, particularly the artist’s 
wife, Fanny, who was the favourite sister of Mendelssohn They 
always sent him invitations, and he went to them more often than 
he could really spare the time He described one of his early visits 
in a letter to his mother 

I went at twelve, for a large musical matinee , they sang the choruses of 
Antigone Then I stayed in the garden with the tutor, and we played 
with Hensel a sort of ninepins , then came dinner, and they asked me 
to return in the evening, as Oehlenschlager, the German poet, was 
coming to them, so I spent nearly the whole day there I have not 
played there yet, as she has not asked me to do so, but when I told her 
I wanted to hire a piano, cheap but not bad, she offered to lend me an 
English one, on which she used to play He, too, is most friendly. 

As to his studies, they were more desultory than concentrated. 
He attended lectures on many languages and subjects, and even 
matriculated in theology His mother felt glad that he was not 
working too hard, but he wiote in his diary ‘Worked early, but 
could not concentrate Dreaming, and a little poetry, and very little 
work I must work more in future ’ Even in respect of Sanskrit, on 
which he wanted to specialize, he could not get permission to lead 
the manuscripts at home until many months later von Humboldt 



WANDERINGS OF YOUNG MAX MULLER 43 

intervened for him But he made translations from Sanskrit, read 
Pali and Hindustani, and learned the elements of Bengali by himself 
What distracted him was anxiety about money combined with 
total unceitainty about the future His scholarship was small 
enough, but even that was going to be stopped at the end of a year. 
At first, to economize, when not asked out he dined at a restaurant 
which supplied a dinner, considered good by him, for only sixpence 
Later he lived on only bread and butter at home, and coffee without 
milk or sugar In the diary which he kept then such entries as ‘no 
dinner’ 01 ‘dinner of scrambled eggs’ (prepared by himself) occur 
frequently Despite all this, he wrote to his mother that he was 
doing well and nothing was wanting to him except his dear little 
mother He even admonished her ‘Don’t say again you do not like 
Chemnitz — a contented spirit is happy anywhere ’ 

He could struggle with poverty but he saw no end to it, and was 
troubled by doubts whether the vocation he had chosen of scholar 
was likely to lead anywhere On June 26, less than three months 
after his arrival in Berlin, he wrote to his mother. 

Where I am to go next Easter is not at all certain I hesitate between 
Pans, Vienna, and Bonn I am attracted to Vienna by the thought of 
studying Persian and Turkish, for which there are better means there 
than in Pans, and they are certainly necessary should I ever have the 
chance of employment in the East You can fancy that these plans often 
disturb me, as for the nearest futuie I have no certain prospect, and 
the umveisity course is so expensive and wearisome, that I cannot 
reckon on it, as generally for the first three years, that is six years after 
leaving school, one is not admitted to anything' Well, one must con- 
sole oneself with the lilies of the field’ 

Two days latei he set down in his diary ‘I cannot give up San- 
skrit, though it holds out no prospect for me ’ Two months later he 
reached even a deeper level of dejection and wrote to his mother: 

I am longing to be away from Berlin, to get a thorough change of 
thought, as I really think I have every chance here of becoming a con- 
firmed hypochondriac. This is no mere transitory feeling, but it is 
founded on my circumstances, which have cost me many sad thoughts 
latterly I acknowledge that the plan of life I had formed is not to be 
realized; that it is difficult for me to part with all these favourite ideas 
you can well imagine And yet it would be folly in my circumstances to 
attempt a university career. 



44 SCHOLAR EXTRAORDINARY 

His mother had assured him that he still had 800 thalers (= £ 120 ), 
the money left by his father to start him in life But Muller told her 
that it would last only until he had settled where to live, and thus he 
would continue to study and starve, in order not to relinquish an 
idea which he had taken up for his own pleasure and for which he 
had sacrificed much money and time He added, with injustice to 
himself, that if he had more courage and a firmer point to cling to, 
he could perhaps still try his luck, but as things were nothing re- 
mained for him but to become a sensible schoolmaster, and this at 
least would give him bread and butter 'You will find/ he com- 
mented, 'that a certain amount of resignation is needed for such a 
decision ’ 

For the moment he was cheered by the prospect of seeing his 
mother and sister, for he was going home for his vacation and for 
a respite from all his anxieties Early in October he returned to 
Berlin, and was relieved to get the news that the Duke had ex- 
tended his mother’s full pension for five years, writing to her T 
hope that your promising son may continue to give you as much 
cause for joy as hitherto ’ But his depression returned, and he 
wrote to his mother. 

I hope you make yourself as happy in the backstream of life as I do As 
I sit here in my garret and for days together see no one I know, I fancy 
myself as a bird alone in its nest on a tall tree, and Leipzig, Chemnitz, 
and Dessau appear perfect Eldorados But I am quite happy and amuse 
myself, by myself, as far as possible Well, I have enough for the 
present, and I think of the birds in the sky They have no fire, yet they 
don’t freeze, but I do freeze 

Relief came to Max Muller within a month or so in the shape of 
his capricious friend, Baron Hagedorn He suddenly appeared in 
Berlin, and invited Max to stay with him in Paris and carry on his 
Sanskrit studies Max immediately fell in with the proposal, and on 
his twenty-first birthday, December 6, 1844, wrote to hus mother* 

My dearly loved Mother, As I am sitting here quite alone on my birth- 
day I must give myself at least the delight of writing to those who love 
me so, and whom I dearly love And first of all comes my darling little 
mother My best thanks for your love and goodness, which in many 
thmgs are far too great I wish I could see you, darling mother, and 
talk over all the unexpected and undeserved kindness that has been 



WANDERINGS OF YOUNG MAX MULLER 45 

shown me I went Thursday early to Hagedorn, and we talked over 
everything, and the result is he has asked me to go to Pans with him , 
to live with him there and work So in about four weeks from today I 
shall be in Pans Hagedorn will tell you all this hims elf more fully 


As it happened, at that time another choice was open to him 
Baron J von Bunsen, then Prussian Minister in London, had 
heard about Muller from Humboldt as well as from Baroness 
Stolzenberg, and he at once wrote to his English friend, Arch- 
deacon Hare, asking whether he could think of any openings for a 
young German who was at twenty-one already a distinguished 
scholar and wanted to live for some years in England As a result, 
there came an offer to go to London as tutor in an English family 
Muller was in great indecision for some time, but finally decided in 
favour of Paris and pleasant independence 

But Hagedorn disappeared, and Max Muller had to go in pursuit 
to Dessau, where he was dawdling At last he settled everything, 
and on February 26 set out with Hagedorn for Pans At Cothen the 
train was stopped by snow and they had to return to Dessau, where 
Hagedorn found business letters awaiting him which kept him 
there. So Max Muller set out alone, and after a number of halts 
arrived in Paris at three o’clock on March 10, 1845 

The arrival was an unsolicited adventure Hagedorn’s address 
was given to him as 25 Rue Royale St Honore, but he had forgotten 
the word Royale, and had himself driven in a fiacre to 25 Rue St 
Honore The concierge stared at him, told him that no Baron 
Hagedorn lived there, and suggested he try 25 Faubourg St Honors, 
where the same scene was repeated. It was a rainy afternoon, and 
Muller was both tired and hungry He was being taken along the 
Boulevard des Itahens, when looking out of the window of the 
carnage he saw a familiar figure on the pavement, an old acquaint- 
ance from Dessau, a half-French half-German hunchback named 
Gathy who was a student of music under his own teacher and had 
become a musical writer in Pans. ‘Gathy, Gathy!’ Muller cried out, 
rescued from his despair, and jumping down told his story Of 
course Gathy knew both Flagedorn and his apartments, and guided 
Muller to the proper place. The concierge was prepared for him, 
and took him to the cmqmeme. He lay down exhausted on a sofa 
and cried out in what Fiench he could command: ‘Donnez-moi 
quelque chose a manger et a boire. ’ That took some time, but food was 



46 SCHOLAR EXTRAORDINARY 

brought, and restoung himself Muller discussed the most necessary 
matters with Gathy 

The immediate problem was money Depending on Hagedorn, 
Max Muller had brought very little with him, and there was no 
Hagedorn But Muller remembered the name of a friend of the 
Baron’s who was with Rothschilds, and went over to the bank This 
man too was away, but another bank official told him that he could 
have as much money as he wanted until the Baron himself or his 
friend returned Then came the larger question of financing his 
whole stay in Paris Muller was to have stayed with Hagedorn, but 
throughout his sojourn in Pans his friend never came there So, 
apart from rent, he had to bear all his own living expenses The free 
lodging was an immense advantage, but still he needed 100 francs 
a month for food and service, without taking into account lighting, 
heating, laundry or clothes His situation in Paris was worse than 
in Berlin 

He had breakfast of bread and butter without coffee, and dined at 
the Palais Royal for two francs This he found too expensive, and 
discovered that beyond the barrier, where there was no octroi, he 
could eat much more cheaply Yet the problem remained of pro- 
viding his daily bread while eking out what money he had for the 
longest possible stay in Paris T am spending a lot of money,’ he 
wrote within days of his arrival , and less than a month later in a 
letter to his mother he reverted to the theme ‘How gladly I would 
have put something in the letter for Auguste’s [his sister’s] birthday 
from the Pans shops, for the sight of the splendid and tastefully 
arranged windows is most tempting But, alas 1 my purse suffers 
from chronic consumption, you know this family complaint, which 
has followed me to Pans ’ Within another month he again wrote 
‘One’s money runs away here, one does not know how, and though 
of course it costs one more in the beginning, the daily wants do not 
lessen That I am saving as much as I can you may be sure, for it is 
my greatest wish to stay here as long as possible, where I have 
found so much necessary to my studies ’ 

He got offers of help from friends, but refused them He had at 
times to borrow money to tide over a temporary difficulty, but he 
never did so unless he knew that some money due to him would 
soon arrive He could also give private lessons, but he had a strong 
dislike of that kind of drudgery. In fact, once he got a very hand- 
some offer to go with Baron von Cetts, the Bavarian Minister to 



WANDERINGS OF YOUNG MAX MULLER 47 

London, as tutor of his children, all expenses paid and 3,000 
francs a year But the Minister required a promise that Muller 
would never leave his children even for an hour, and such a con- 
dition appeared so degrading and foolish to him that he declined 
He wrote to his mother 


It was a substantial position, which would free me from many dis- 
agreeable things, and in which, instead of taking money from you, my 
dearest mother, I could have given you some little pleasure But it was 
impossible, unless I sacrificed my whole future, and wasted the little I 
have already done, and I hope that as I feel I have little to reproach 
myself with, I shall not be blamed by others 

What he would do to earn money was to copy Sanskrit manu- 
scripts for the Orientalists who wanted copies Even this meant very 
hard work, and his plan was to sit up the whole of one night, take 
three hours’ rest the next night without however undressing, and 
then take a full night’s rest, and repeat the sequence This was not 
good for his health He suffered both in body and in mind, and at 
times felt very lonely and homesick, all the more so because of his 
strong attachment to his mother He often wrote about it, for ex- 
ample, on April 10 ‘You can fancy that in this utterly strange land 
I sometimes feel lonely and forsaken, and would gladly find myself 
for a few hours in Chemnitz with you ’ But he also knew that the 
poverty as well as the separation was of his own choice At the end 
of his life he wrote in his autobiography ‘It was, indeed, a hard 
struggle, far harder than those who have known me in later life 
would believe It was a hard fight, and cannot have been good for 
me physically, but I do not regret it now.’ He told himself that he 
had mapped out his course of life and, as he added ‘It was in my 
own hands whether I should swim or sink ’ 

He kept his resolution and swam, but it was at first like the swim- 
ming of a shipwrecked sailor who clings to a plank without seeing 
anybody near him, and then suddenly catches sight of a rescuing 
boat* All the early openings in his career came unexpectedly, and 
were almost like windfalls While waiting for them he sought relief 
from his anxieties in work, and for his sorrow at separation from his 
family in religion and philosophy As he wrote to his mother 


Separation loses its bitterness when we have faith in each other and in 
God. Faith in each other keeps us close together in life, and faith in 



48 SCHOLAR EXTRAORDINARY 

God keeps us together in eternity But I see I am talking Sanskrit 
philosophy instead of simply telling you not to be unhappy, not to 
make yourself and others uneasy, but try to enjoy life in this lovely 
spring weather, whether in Chemnitz or Dresden [Or again] But 
enough of these lamentations, which are of no use, least of all in Paris 
Melancholy and frivolity are the two scales in which men here go up 
and down , happy he who sits in the middle quiet and observant as an 
Indian Muni [Sage] 

Max Muller was only twenty-two when he wrote that, and was 
amazed to find that he was so old 

There was however something deeper in his moods of dejection 
than could be accounted for by their apparent and tangible causes, 
such as lack of money, separation from family and friends, struggle 
to make a career and great uncertainty over it Even when he was 
happily settled and prosperous at Oxford, sudden fits of depression 
and restlessness would come over him. But such swings are habi- 
tual to those who begin life and spend their first years in an environ- 
ment which is socially and culturally stable, and then take the road 
to other worlds in which they can never again take root 

But it is wrong to say that they become mentally, socially, or 
culturally deracme On the other hand, they can develop a very high 
capacity to assimilate themselves into any environment and move 
naturally in it This is true cosmopolitanism, which in spite of its 
- diverse elements is a stable, though compound, product. The unity 
of such lives is that of harmonic and contrapuntal music The basic 
strand in it is always the deep bass of the early environment, punc- 
tuating the other melodic lines and sometimes surging above them. 
Then comes the middle register of work and woikaday life, and, 
above all, there is the treble line of creative moods and moments of 
revelation, all accompanied by the trills and other decorative 
figures of sense experience Such a life is no more ill-orgamzed 
than a symphony But it is not easily put together. 

However, the initial homesickness is made more painful if a man 
has migrated from a small town 01 village. It is these men who feel 
most cruelly the truth of the saying that a great city is a great 
desert Muller had come from Dessau, and even at Leipzig his life 
was not different in kind But when he went to Berlin, Paris and 
London, he saw an agglomeration of people and not a community 
He suffered cruelly at this contrast. 

But of course the other parts of his mmd remained active, and he 



WANDERINGS OF YOUNG MAX MULLER 49 

could amuse himself with what he saw As he wrote to his mother 
‘For interesting observation there is no place like this ’ Only he 
wished his mother there too At first he took to that absorbing 
occupation of a visitor, Flaner a Pans , lounging about in the city 
and taking in its outward beauty, and also taking delight in the rush 
and bustle of the streets The contrast of such scenes with the quiet 
of Dessau and Leipzig made him laugh out loud Soon after his 
arrival he found that the days which, in the serious world, were 
called Holy Thursday and Good Friday, were known as Longchamps 
m Paris, and he saw magnificent equipages, ladies in splendid 
dresses and well-groomed gentlemen, driving out through the 
Champs Elysees to the races 

Muller had come to Paris in the last days of the Orleamst Mon- 
archy, when the middle-class regime created by the July Revolution 
fifteen years before had become stagnant but had not yet provoked 
another revolution In the Place du Carrousel at only twenty 
paces from himself he saw the bourgeois King Louis-Phihppe as he 
was riding with his whole suite to watch the craze of the day, the 
midget General Tom Thumb, who held receptions in Rue Richelieu 
and drove out in his carriage the size of a child’s go-cart 

Life in Paris did not then have the garishness it acquired under 
the Second Empire But it had its lurid lights. Muller saw some of 
these When dining hors de la barnere he once noticed a strange lady 
sitting not very far from him, and learned that she was the well- 
known Louve of Eugene Sue’s Mysteres de Pans, or, in other words, 
she belonged to the Orleamst prototype of the world of Toulouse- 
Lautrec At the end of his stay he went to a masked ball at the 
Opera, which he described as odious, full of vulgar people, wretched 
di esses, noise, tumult and at the end drunken stupor for all But the 
music, he added, was excellent 

He also saw the flaming comet of the day, the actress Rachel in 
Racine’s Phkdre He described what he saw to his mother ‘From the 
beginning to the end Rachel was nothing but a pale shadow whose 
only life is passion and despair, but passion which fails in all tragic 
effect because it has no influence on one’s feelings. It is a crude and 
painful passion with which she is possessed, and in which there is 
nothing to awake our sympathy ’ 

But the most exceptional experience Muller had in Paris was his 
acquaintance with a wealthy Bengali from Calcutta, who was 
creating as great a sensation in the French capital as Dumas’s Count 



SO SCHOLAR EXTRAORDINARY 

of Monte Cnsto He was Dwarkanath Tagore, fathei of Deben- 
dranath Tagore, the religious reformer, and grandfather of the 
great Indian poet, Rabindranath Tagore, the only Indian to have 
received the Nobel Prize for Literature He had taken the best 
suite in one of the best hotels of Pans, and was spending lavishly 
Not only did King Louis-Philippe receive him, he even came with 
his court to a grand party given by Tagore, who had the room hung 
with real Cashmere shawls, then the ambition of every fashionable 
woman, and as she left placed a shawl on the shoulders of every lady. 

Tagore had been told that Muller had already copied and collated 
the MSS of the Veda in Pans, and so showed lively interest in the 
young German, inviting him to his hotel Muller went there often, 
and spent the mornings discussing India and Indian customs, and 
also practising English and Bengali He discovered that Tagore was 
very fond of music, was in fact an accomplished musician himself, 
and had acquired a taste for Italian music 

One day Muller asked him to sing something Indian, and Tagore 
at first sang a Persian song Max Muller did not want to hear that, 
but genuine Indian or Hindu music Tagore smiled and turned 
away, saying 'You would not appreciate it ’ But as Muller went on 
pressing, he sat down at the piano and accompanying himself began 
to smg Muller could discern neither melody, nor rhythm, nor 
harmony in what he sang When told this, Tagore shook his head 
and said 'You are all alike If anything seems strange to you and 
does not please you at once, you turn away When I first heard 
Italian music, it was no music to me at all , but I went on and on, 
till I began to like it, or, what you call, understand it.’ 

Then he began a general homily 

It is the same with everything else, [he went on] You say our religion 
is no religion, our poetry no poetry, our philosophy no philosophy 
We try to understand and appreciate whatever Europe has produced, 
but do not imagine that we despise what India has produced If you 
studied our music as we do yours, you would find that there is melody, 
rhythm, and harmony in it, quite as much as in yours And if you would 
study our poetry, our religion, and our philosophy, you would find 
that we are not what you call heathens or miscreants, but know as 
much of the Unknowable as you do, and have seen perhaps deeper into 
it than you have! 

He became very eloquent, and so excited that Max Muller pacified

him by saying that he was quite aware that India possessed a science 
of music founded on mathematics 

This speech of Tagore’s has a profoundly significant historical 
importance as one of the earliest utterances of the polemical position 
of modern Indians against their British rulers and detractors These 
Hindus were accepting the West and rediscovering their ancient 
civilization at the same time, and creating a liberal nationalism 
based on a cultural synthesis to which the British never had an 
effective answer Max Muller was to remain in touch with this 
nationalism all his life 

He also found another expression of both liberalism and national- 
ism in Dwarkanath Tagore and that was in his cynicism towards 
the Brahmins and also towards what he called the ‘black-coated 
Brahmins’, the Anglican clergy 

The dislike which Dwarkanath and all Hindu nationalists felt for 
English clergymen, in spite of their sincere admiration for so many 
other things English and also their gratitude for what the mission- 
aries were doing for India in the way of education, was due to the 
fact that these men aired, in the most arrogant and frigid form, the 
moral superiority which the British in India felt towards the natives 
Thus Dwarkanath, who read many English newspapers, copied out 
m a sort of black book he kept all the reports which did not re- 
dound to the credit of any bishop, dean, or priest, and he took great 
delight in bringing out this collection of every kind of ecclesiastical 
scandal whenever the talk turned on the respective merits of the 
Hindu and the Christian religions Max Muller could only reply that 
no religion, whether in Italy, England, or India, should be judged 
by its priests. 

Muller had opportunities to meet the foremost literary and in- 
tellectual figuies of France of that epoch through Baron d’Eckstein, 
who gave him plenty of work in the way of copying Sanskrit manu- 
scripts and paid him liberally, thus helping him to keep financially 
afloat in Paris Eckstein was a notability in Pans, and had acquired 
his position as a propagator of Hindu wisdom and as an inter- 
mediary between Hindu thought and spirituality and the greatest 
writers of the day. He offered to introduce Muller to George Sand, 
Lamennais, Daniel Stern (Comtesse d’Agoult), Lamartine, Victor 
Hugo and others. But Muller had neither the time nor the money to 
take part in social life, nor did he have the inclination to make for- 
mal calls on celebrities. But he regretted it afterwards, and said that 



52 SCHOLAR EXTRAORDINARY 

one result of his seeing so little of French life was that his spoken 
French remained imperfect 

But in connexion with his own interests he was bound to meet 
French Orientalists, both old and young, and he moved in their set 
His first desire was to meet Burnouf, whose works he had read and 
for whom he had acquired a very great respect But he did not know 
his address, and had to wait until Gathy discovered it for him He 
then summoned up his courage and called on him When he walked 
m he found a dear old gentleman in his dressing-gown, surrounded 
by his books and his four little daughters who were helping him to 
collect and arrange alphabetically a number of slips on which he had 
jotted down whatever had struck him as important in his reading 
during the day Muller saw that the scholar was small, with a face 
that was decidedly German but became distinctively French when 
lighted up by a sparkle Burnouf could hardly understand Muller 
because his French was very poor But he showed him a civility 
such as he had not met with before He inquired warmly after his 
German teachers, Brockhaus, Bopp and Lassen, and even men- 
tioned a small book which Muller had written. He told him that he 
might attend his lectures in the College de France, and added that 
he would be most happy to give him any advice or help he wanted 
Muller at once felt perfect trust in him, and was aux cieux , as he put 
it, to have found such an adviser 
Muller attended the lectures which Burnouf gave on the first 
book of the Rig-Veda as published by Rosen, and discovered Bur- 
nouf was a different type of lecturer He had a small and select 
audience of young scholars like Roth and Goldstucker who were to 
become great specialists in Sanskrit, and also older men like Bar- 
th&emy St Hilaire, once a Minister of Foreign Affairs in France, 
and the Abbe Bardelli He would explain his method, give his 
students all the new information he had collected and make them 
his fellow-workers All this Muller found to be very inspiring, 
more especially because Burnouf was very generous in his approval 
and if his pupils found out anything new he was delighted to give 
them full credit for it. They all worked as a team, exploring, map- 
ping out and prospecting a new and unknown country — which in- 
deed the world of Oriental scholarship then was 
It was in Pans and at the express direction of Burnouf that Max 
Muller finally canalized his Sanskritic studies into the highly 
specialized research project which was to gam recognition for him 



WANDERINGS OF YOUNG MAX MULLER 53 

m the world of scholarship that of editing and publishing the 
Rig-Veda , the oldest scripture of the Hindus 

While working on the manuscripts of the Rig-Veda in Pans he 
often felt the want of some essential manuscripts which he knew 
were in the library of the East India Company in London, and 
therefore he wished to go over to consult them Rut he did not have 
the money even to make the journey, far less for a stay At last, in 
June 1846, when he was six months short of being twenty-three, he 
scraped together enough for a flying trip Though Muller could 
not afford to cultivate the celebrities of Paris, he had made many 
personal friends, among whom were not only fellow-workers in the 
Oriental field but also a Duchess and a Countess, both of whom 
were musical and made much of him These and others, including 
Burnouf, gave him farewell parties, and many of them came to the 
post-house to see him off He left Paris at 5 pm on June 9, and 
arrived at Boulogne by the diligence at 1 1 a in the next day He had 
never seen the sea before, and the sight of the wide, dancing expanse 
excited him so much that he hardly had the patience to go into the 
hotel, but set off at once for a long walk along the shore, and 
wandered about for five hours until forced to return by sheer 
hunger. 

At ten o’clock that night he went on board the ship which was to 
take him direct to London It was almost full moon, and he re- 
mained on deck taking in the beauty of the scene. But soon a rough 
passage brought on an onset of seasickness, and turned his delight 
into misery A young Englishman, who was a fellow-passenger, 
found him holding on to the stays, trying to resist the attacks, and 
watched him with interest This was William Howard Russell, who 
was to become the most famous war correspondent of his time, and 
was then working for The Times as well as studying law 

In the morning, once the ship had entered the Thames, Muller 
recovered Russell saw a young man with regular features, fine 
intelligent eyes, most engaging expression, thick, dark hair but no 
trace of whiskers, beard or moustache, neatly dressed in a suit 
which showed his erect, slight, but well-built figure to advantage. 
The melancholy expression of the previous night had vanished from 
his face, and he was standing with an alert air and penetrating gaze 
When a question from him to another passenger produced a mis- 
leading answer, Russell stepped up and gave the true explanation 
Then they became acquainted Muller said that he was going to 



54 SCHOLAR EXTRAORDINARY 

London to pursue his studies in Oriental literature, and Russell 
said that he was a law student in the Middle Temple 
At the Customs House above Blackwall Muller found that his 
portmanteau with all his worldly goods, and particularly his papers 
and letters, had not arrived He was in a panic and told Russell that 
if it was lost that would be ruinous to him The luggage of all the 
passengers was gone over again, but there was not a trace of the 
missing trunk Seeing Muller’s distress Russell offered to take him 
to his chambers, give him a shakedown for the night, and come back 
the next day to look for the box Very much moved, Muller accepted 
the offer, was driven to the Temple, and after dining at Andertons 
m Fleet Street, went to sleep on a comfortable couch and in a sleep- 
ing suit provided by the laundress The next day Russell and 
Muller went back to the Customs House and found the trunk, and 
Russell secured a decent bedroom for him at io$ a week at the 
house of a tailor in near-by Essex Street Max Muller settled him- 
self in, and in two days had seen Hyde Park, St James’s Palace, 
Westminster, St Paul’s and the Tower, besides calling on Professor 
Wilson to obtain permission to examine manuscripts in the library 
of the East India Company 

During the first months of his stay in London Muller and 
Russell met almost every day In those days students could take 
friends to their rooms after dimng in hall at the Temple Muller was 
always a welcome guest at Russell’s, and he provided novel and 
exhilarating entertainment by singing, Edite , bibite, conviviales, 
Cramambuh and other studentenheder Those who had rooms at the 
Temple were eager to secure a special right to one performance, 
which was always applauded and encored. That was O Tannen - 
baum, O Tannenbaum an imitation of the whole orchestra, trum- 
pets, drums, bassoons and what not, delivered with the greatest 
perfection 

Russell as a newspaper reporter got free tickets to concerts and 
theatres, and the two went night after night to Drury Lane, the 
Haymarket, the Adelphi, Her Majesty’s, Covent Garden and others 
Muller’s enjoyment of the opera was intense, and after seeing the 
Italian opera he wrote to his mother * 

A friend took me to the Italian Opera, which I had not yet seen either 
here or in Pans It was wonderful A larger house than I have ever 
seen, and every one in full dress The boxes filled with the nobility, 



WANDERINGS OF YOUNG MAX MULLER 55 

and I saw Queen Victoria and Prince Albert, the Duke of Cambridge, 
etc The music absolutely perfect, Anna Bolena , sung by Gnsi, Mario 
and Lablache, all the highest artistic perfection And then a ballet to 
which there can be nothing equal, and Jugement de Pans with Taglioni, 
Grahn, and Cento as the three goddesses The decorations were 
beautiful 


Muller’s work in London offered no difficulty Wilson at once 
gave him permission not only to examine the manuscripts, but even 
to take them home On the very first day he invited him to dinner 
Muller also paid visits to the British Museum, and made pleasant 
acquaintances there 

His first great difficulty was with English, which he could not 
speak well enough to make himself easily understood He wrote to 
his mother that he hoped to improve, and his struggles with the 
language began soon enough The morning after he had moved into 
his room in Essex Street, his landlady came in to inquire how he 
had slept, and then put another question ‘But, sir, don’t you want 
another “pillar” Muller’s bed was an immense four-poster, and 
as he had never seen such a structure before he had been in constant 
fear the previous night that the top would fall upon him and smother 
him Bewildered by his landlady’s pronunciation, he looked at the 
posts of the bed and asked in his turn ‘Why, what shall I do with 
another pillar, and where will you put iU’ She then touched the 
pillows on the bed and said, ‘Well, sir, you shall have another 
“pillar” tomorrow ’ Muller said to himself ‘How shall I ever learn 
English if a “pillar” means a soft pillow 

But his greatest problem was still money Fie found that his 
German money did not go far in London, and he thought of supple- 
menting it by giving private lessons At the same time he econo- 
mized as much as he could He was paying is 6 d for his dinners, but 
moved to new lodgings where he could eat with a German fellow- 
lodger for is He walked with armfuls of books and papers from the 
libiary in Leadenhall Street to wherever his rooms were Sometimes 
he was even roughly treated He had taken his broken spectacles to 
be repaired at a shop in the Strand, and when he went to fetch them 
he laid down a soveieign The salesman gave him change for only 
half a sovereign, and when Max Muller pointed out the mistake he 
became abusive to the foreigner in a well-worn coat Sadly he left 
the shop, aware that the ten shillings represented several dinners, 



56 SCHOLAR EXTRAORDINARY 

and actually some days passed dinnerless One evening, however, 
as Muller was passing the shop the man rushed out, saying ‘Oh, 
sir, I have watched for you several days You were right, I found 
that I had ten shillings too much when I counted up my money that 
evening, and I have longed to get it back to you,’ and then he added, 
Tor you look as if you wanted it ’ 

His long-term worries were more harrowing He found that there 
was so much material in London and so much work needing to be 
done on it, that unless he was to lose the benefit of all that he had 
already done he must stay there for years As he wrote to Burnouf 

The MSS are splendid, but in such masses that to copy all that con- 
cerns the Veda and my work would take at least two or three years of 
merely mechanical labour So I must stay in England I shall do this 
if I can possibly, by private lessons and copying MSS, make enough to 
face the great expense of life here I do not deny that it is perhaps 
foolish to make such a sacrifice, and lead this anxious life for another 
five years without doing anything that can secure a settled post, but 
as I have once begun the work it must be finished, and I see no other 
way of doing it 

Burnouf replied to say that his plans were excellent, and hoped 
that Wilson would do something ‘Mr Wilson/ he wrote, ‘will in- 
directly render a great service to Indian letters if, with the benevo- 
lent liberality with which he meets all those who ask his support, he 
makes it possible for you to stay in London as long as the task of 
publishing your Rig-Veda with its commentaries and indispensable 
indices may require * To his mother Muller gave an estimate of five 
years, and said that his work was full of interest, and kept him 
straight, but he also added ‘Yet sometimes one longs for more in 
life than this everlasting struggle ’ 

Wilson was always sympathetic and willing to help, but for the 
present he could not help practically That help came from another 
source, Baron C K J von Bunsen, Prussian Minister in London 
He was one of the most remarkable men of his age, a scholar who 
thought of himself as a student, a seeker of the origins of religion 
and spirituality, a man of bold and original ideas which were con- 
sidered unorthodox, and possessing a waimth of heart not usual in 
the intellectual type Yet he was a diplomat and a man of the world, 
with such social talents that the whole elite of London cultivated 
him 



WANDERINGS OF YOUNG MAX MULLER 57 

He had formed the idea of writing a history of spirituality when 
he was only twenty-five, and had actually planned to go to India to 
find the Veda which was believed to embody the earliest spiritual 
expression of man But while waiting in Rome on his way to the 
East, he became a friend of the Piussian Crown Prince, the future 
King Frederick William IV, and eventually joined the diplomatic 
service of his country But though he gave up the idea of studying 
the Veda, he never lost his scholarly and philosophical interests He 
worked hard at his books, and published the first of his many large 
works on religion and philosophy, Christianity and Mankind, in 1854 
On the strength of recommendations from Humboldt and Baro- 
ness Stolzenberg he had in 1844 secured for Max Muller the offer 
of a tutorship, which Muller had rejected But the two had never 
met Now they did, about three weeks after Muller’s arrival in 
London, when he called on Bunsen at 4 Carlton Terrace At that 
time, Bunsen was fifty-five and Muller still not twenty-three Muller 
was astonished by the warmth of his reception This meeting was a 
turning-point in his career, and to the end of his life Muller felt 
that he could never adequately express what he owed to Bunsen 
Bunsen told him how glad he was to see the son of his old friend, 
and advised him to continue his researches without giving thought 
to anything else When Muller told him about his work and his 
financial difficulties, Bunsen at once assured him that he had found 
a friend (meaning himself) who would care for him as a father for a 
son And he kept his word He asked Muller to trust him absolutely, 
for he was going to take all responsibility on himself For nearly a 
year Muller was supported by his patron, and without that help he 
would have had to abandon his researches and go back to Germany 
What attracted Bunsen to Muller was in the first instance the 
Veda, whose quest he had to renounce Thus whenever he was 
shown some portion of Muller’s work, he said T am glad to have 
lived to see the Veda Whatever you want, let me know. I look upon 
you as myself grown young again ’ 

But if Bunsen himself was attracted by what he knew of Muller’s 
mind, the ladies of the family felt the attraction of his presence 
Mme Bunsen cherished the remembrance of his first appearance at 
her house for, as she wrote, he astonished the family by his youthful 
looks and cheerfulness 

Though Muller did not live in Carlton Terrace, he made it his real 
home in London, and came and went whenever he pleased Often, 



58 SCHOLAR EXTRAORDINARY 

even during receptions, Bunsen would sit with him in the library 
discussing all sorts of subjects with him They did not always agree 
During his stay in Rome Bunsen had become acquainted with 
Champollion, the decipherer of hieroglyphics, and had shifted his 
interest to Egyptology As a result, he inclined to give primacy to 
Egypt and not to India in respect of the first emergence of thought 
and civilization Max Muller did not deny that Egypt had older his- 
torical records, but he said that his interest lay in thought Bunsen at 
times got very excited, for in argument he could be very violent, 
but that never made any difference to his affection for Muller, who 
was invited to all parties and special occasions besides being taken 
to Bunsen’s country-house at Totteridge 

Everybody who was anybody in London came to Bunsen’s 
house, and there Max Muller saw such personalities as the Arch- 
bishop of Canterbury, the Duke of Wellington, Sir Robert Peel, 
also divines, intellectuals and scholars in many fields of knowledge 
Connop Thirwal, F D Maurice, Rawhnson, Layard, Hodgson and 
Birch The discussions mostly took place at breakfast parties, which 
were in fashion then in London as they remained for many more 
decades at Oxford They were quite new to Muller and he enjoyed 
them very much, though he thought that they broke too much into 
the day Some of Bunsen’s parties were very grand affairs, and some 
idea of them can be formed from a description that Muller gave to 
his mother three years later 

They had asked 750 people — the whole Corps Diplomatique and the 
elite of English society The whole house was like a garden, the bal- 
conies covered with awnmgs from which one had a splendid view over 
London, the garden of the house illuminated, beautiful music, German 
songs with a full chorus, from the German opera now in London I 
cannot describe the diamonds and dresses, but I have never seen such 
a crowd of beautiful women and girls together Guizot was there, and 
Palmerston, in fact, all the lions and lionesses of the season. 

The normal parties were, however, much more intimate, and 
Muller liked the whole family Besides having Muller in his own 
house, Bunsen also took him to his friends, both in the country and 
in London One day he took him to the house of his friend, Arch- 
deacon Hare at Hurstmonceaux Another time he was taken to 
Lord Ellesmere’s house, famous for its priceless collections of books 
and pictures. He wrote to his mother: 'Only think of looking round

in the middle of a conversation and seeing on all sides Raphaels, 
Titians, Murillos, Carlo Dolcis — all originals He added a com- 
ment which makes me feel that things have changed since his days 
‘This sort of thing only exists in England 9 

At first this kind of life was a great trial for Muller, for he com- 
mitted any number of gaucheries from his ignorance He did not 
know, as he wrote in his autobiography, that potatoes could not be 
eaten with a fork, nor fish touched with the table-knife (for fish- 
knives did not exist then), and he could not understand why it was 
worse manners to divide crisp pastry with a knife than with a fork 
scattering it over the table-cloth He also had difficulties in address- 
ing and writing to people Once, having been told to address a per- 
son exactly as he was addressed by him, he wrote a letter to the 
Bishop of Oxford, Bishop Wilberforce, with the superscription, ‘My 
dear Sir, 9 because the Bishop had written to him in that way Bunsen 
remonstrated with him for not returning calls nor leaving cards 
after dining with people Yet Bunsen took delight in inviting Muller 
whenever he had a prince or some such grandee to lunch or dinner 

These were kindnesses meant to lick the German bear cub into 
shape, and Bunsen showed no less kindness when he found that 
Muller could not go to see his mother in Germany when she was 
seriously ill He at once sent him to Berlin with despatches, and 
this also gave him an opportunity to meet his German friends and 
patrons After he returned from Berlin, Bunsen helped Muller in 
another way which relieved him of all anxiety and dependence in 
regard to money, and put his plan to publish the Rig- Veda on a 
sound financial basis 

Max Muller had begun to copy and collate the mss of the Rtg- 
Veda with a view to printing it eventually, but he worked in com- 
plete uncertainty, because he did not know who might be willing 
to publish it He sounded out the Prussian government for financial 
support, but without success In Pans, too, he had no luck An offer 
came from the Academy of St Petersburg, but on such conditions 
that he could not accept it At last a German publisher of Konigs- 
berg came forward, but he would undertake the actual work only if 
a sufficient number of copies were subscribed for beforehand By 
way of publicity Muller had a prospectus printed in a number of 
languages The Prussian and the French governments agreed to 
take a large number of sets, but the subscription was still short, and 
the East India Company was approached with a request to take one

hundred sets At the suggestion of both Bunsen and Wilson, 
Muller called on the Directors, but they were unwilling to give 
financial support to a work carried out in a foreign country Then 
Bunsen, who had influence with the Directors, stepped in ener- 
getically It was no easy task to persuade the Board of Directors, 
all practical businessmen, to authorize considerable expenditure 
on an old book which none of them could read and many had not 
even heard of But Bunsen saw the Chairman as well as the Direc- 
tors, and represented to them what a disgrace it would be if some 
other country than England published this sacred book of the 
Hindus Professor Wilson too threw in his weight At their insis- 
tence, the Directors agreed to the project in principle 

But the working out and consideration of the details took time, 
for the commitment was not only to be large but also uncertain 
During this period Muller was very restless and uncomfortable, and 
thought that the uncertainty was making him unfit to do any work 
As he wrote to his mother 'The whole month has gone in hopes, 
expectations, disappointments, and rejoicings, and though it is 
possible that I might hear today that all is settled, it may dawdle on 
to next year, and even fail entirely * But he had confidence in Bun- 
sen It did dawdle on, to the April of 1847, but on April 15 he in- 
formed his mother joyfully that the matter was decided He could 
hardly believe that the struggle was ending and the independence 
he had hoped for had at last come He was to get .£4 for every sheet 
printed, which, according to the programme of editing and printing 
Muller had worked out would give him £200 a year, which would 
enable him to live at ease, and the income was guaranteed for the 
duration of the whole work, which might be many years 
As it happened, there came to him at the same time an offer of a 
post as assistant librarian in the British Museum at .£150 a year But 
on Bunsen’s advice he declined it, preferring his freedom and trust- 
ing to time to bring him some means of livelihood which would be 
permanent. Among all his feelings the gratitude he felt towards 
Bunsen was the strongest. He wrote to his mother. 

I knew that none of my relations and friends agreed with me, on the 
contrary, that they all thought my plans foolish and exaggerated, and 
I had no one from whom I could expect support — I mean, who would 
have lent me a small sum for a few years In fact, all my time, money, 
and work, indeed my whole life perhaps would have been sacrificed 
and lost, had not Bunsen, who had once been in the same position,

without my saying anything to him, stood by me, and in this way 
made it possible for me to struggle on with joyful confidence and firm 
faith towards the goal I had set before me I do not know whether I 
should thank God more that I have at last attained my long-desired 
and long-sought object or that I have gained the friendship of so noble 
and distinguished a man as Bunsen 

The work of printing began at once at Oxford, though he sent the 
text and corrected the proofs from London But in February 1847, 
before the question of printing had been decided, Max Muller had 
to come to Oxford to consult a manuscript in the Bodleian, and 
that was his first visit to the place where the following year he was 
to settle and spend the rest of his life He was enchanted by what he 
saw, and informed his mother ‘I have seen the most interesting and 
beautiful city in Europe The whole town is of the Middle Ages, 
and consists almost entirely of churches, monasteries (now colleges), 
castles, and towers, all in old English or Gothic, and the whole life 
is of the Middle Ages * What struck him no less strongly was the 
contrast presented by the students and teachers going about in 
their black gowns, to what he had seen in German university 
towns like Leipzig or Jena where the students walked about in 
the streets in pink cotton trousers and dressing-gowns 

He came to Oxford four months later to pay a more formal visit, 
to read a paper before the seventeenth meeting of the British 
Association for the Advancement of Science held in 1847 One day, 
when he had gone to see Bunsen with some of his work, Bunsen 
said ‘You must come with me to Oxford to the meeting of the 
British Association 5 Muller asked him what this was, and Bunsen 
replied that he would explain it later, but Muller was to sit down at 
once and write a paper He himself was going to read a paper on the 
‘Results of the recent Egyptian Researches in reference to Asiatic 
and African Ethnology and Classification of Languages’, and he 
wanted Dr Karl Meyer to support him with one on Celtic philology, 
and Muller with another on the relationship between the Aryan 
and aboriginal languages of India Muller was thoroughly fright- 
ened, but Bunsen would not take a refusal, and said ‘We must 
show them what we have done in Germany for the history and 
philosophy of language, and I reckon on your help ’ But also he was 
anxious to advance Muller’s career, and wanted to introduce him 
not only to the world of learning, but to all important people who 
might be able to help him 



62 SCHOLAR EXTRAORDINARY 

Muller prepared the paper, but remained nervous, for he knew 
that, generally speaking, English scholars were hostile to German 
scholarship. More especially, he was afraid of some not very 
friendly ethnologists like Dr Latham and Mr Crawford, the latter 
well known in British learned circles as the Objector General As he 
expected, he was criticized when in his paper he tried to prove the 
Indo-European and Sanskntic affiliations of the Bengali language, 
which were being denied by a school of English philologists But 
the opposition was not so much against him or his views, as against 
what a group of English scholars called the ‘German clique’ headed 
by Prince Albert and Bunsen , and the Prince too was present at the 
congress However, Dr Pritchard, the pioneer British anthro- 
pologist, defended him very generously Later, there was even ob- 
jection to including Muller’s paper in the proceedings, but Bunsen 
declared that he would not allow his own paper to be printed unless 
Muller’s was also, so it was Max Muller never reprinted the paper 
because he thought it was very immature But I found it extremely 
interesting as the first formulation of his linguistic ideas I have also 
been surprised by the knowledge he showed of the Bengali language, 
which he had learned in Berlin and then practised with Dwarkanath 
Tagore in Pans 

Though this was his first participation in a learned conference, 
Max Muller was not very much impressed by the discussions, the 
wranghngs of scholars as he called them, but he found the social 
occasions connected with the conference very interesting Being 
with Bunsen, he was invited to all the official dinners, at which the 
grave Vice-Chancellor, Dr Frederick Plumptree, presided At one 
of these Prince Lucien Bonaparte delivered a eulogy of British 
freedom ‘In France’, he declared, ‘with all the declamations about 
Liberte, Egahte, Fraternite, there is very little freedom, but you in 
England, you have your old tree of liberty, which is always flower- 
ing and showering peas on the whole world ’ A titter went round 
the table, stopping only at the Vice-Chancellor 

Max Muller went back to London to resume his work on the 
Rig-Veda But in order to establish a text he had to go to Pans early 
next year He also wanted to consult a particular manuscript in the 
Bibhoth&que Nationale, and to see Hagedorn. But he was caught in 
the February Revolution From the windows of Hagedorn’s apart- 
ment he saw the fighting and the tumult, and gave an account of his 
experience to his mother

I am still so excited that I can hardly describe all that I have seen and 
done Since Tuesday last [Feb 24] I have had sleepless nights from 
fighting, the roar of cannon, burning of houses, fall of buildings, etc , 
men murdered by hundreds or simply shot down in the streets No one’s 
life was safe, for there was neither Government, police, nor soldiers 
The man in the blouse was lord of all, and blood ran in the streets, 
which were filled with barricades Women on horseback, ruffians on 
the finest officers’ chargers paraded the streets, carrying Louis- 
Philippe’s throne in triumph One could see all that went on from 
Hagedorn’s windows, the bullets whistled on every side, and yet ladies 
went out on foot pour voir la Revolution We did the same, and were 
more than once pursued by the cavalry I saw barricades built up of 
omnibuses, tables and pianos, attacked and taken, and again built up, 
till at last the soldiers fraternized with the people, gave up their 
weapons, and finally withdrew There was nothing grand in it 

When too many bullets began to come through his windows, 
Max Muller thought it prudent to leave Pans Rut the problem was 
to take back his trunk full of precious manuscripts, all belonging to 
the East India Company, for though the railway line to Le Havre 
was open, the station had been burnt down, and in order to get to 
the trams he would have to climb over three barricades He offered 
his concierge five francs to carry the box, but the consierge’s wife 
would not hear of it He raised it to ten francs, with the same 
result But when he held up a louts d 3 or she said to her husband 
‘ Allez y mon ami , allez toujours 3 

As soon as he arrived in London he went to see Bunsen, and 
Bunsen took him at once to Palmerston, to whom Muller gave the 
first news of the deposition of Louis-Phihppe, and he also showed 
him a bullet which he had picked up in his own room After that he 
went on with his work, but found that the work of reading the proofs 
from London was slow as well as tiring So he decided to migrate to 
Oxford Another reason which inclined him to do so was that he 
thought he was getting too gay in London In addition to Bunsen’s 
parties he had his own social engagements For instance, he went 
regularly to the suppers given by his friend Vaux of the British 
Museum, whose invitation cards were adorned with pictures of 
Assyrian bulls and hawk-headed Egyptian gods, and he also went to 
balls at the houses of his English friends, and danced away in his 
old coat, finding the English girls to be very beautiful and pleasant 

He wrote to his mother that 'one hardly sees a single ugly face in a

ballroom — which one cannot say in either France or Germany’ 
Then he had his German circle, consisting of German Sanskrit 
scholars as well as the German merchants at Denmark Hill All this 
came in the way of his work So in May 1848, he went to Oxford, 
and took rooms in Walton Street As it happened, this turned out 
to be the beginning of a lifelong stay 

But even at Oxford Max Muller was not to live the life of a re- 
cluse His paper had been printed along with Bunsen’s by that 
time, and in academic circles he found it to be ‘a good visiting card’, 
as he told his mother His handsome looks, extremely youthful 
appearance, the unfamiliar subject with which he was occupied 
and the kind words spoken about him by Bunsen and Dr Pritchard 
were remembered, and he was received very kindly by the heads of 
colleges, the younger teachers and the undergraduates But on 
account of his age, and in spite of his scholarship, he moved most 
naturally and happily among the younger fellows and under- 
graduates A majority of them were Balliol men, which meant the 
most brilliant young men at Oxford in those days Moner, Grant, 
Sellar, Palgrave, Spottiswoode, Walrond, Earle, Church, Butler, 
Thomson, Story-Maskelyne, all to rise to one kind of distinction or 
another, were among his intimates He also knew Matthew Arnold, 
Clough, Jowett, Stanley, Froude, Coxe, Johnson, Acland, Donkin 
and many others They were a happy company, and recalling them 
Max Muller wrote at the very end of his life ‘Those early Oxford 
days were bright for me, and now, when those young and old faces, 
whether undergraduates or archbishops, rise up again before me, I 
being almost the only one left of that happy company, I ask again, 
‘Did they also belong to a mere dreamland, they who gave life to 
my hfe, and made England my real home ?* 

He was noticed by the town, as well as the gown, as a rare and 
exotic bird in the streets As he passed among them he observed 
people staring at him and whispering to one another A vague 
notion had got about that the handsome young German had dis- 
covered a strange religion older than the Jewish or Christian, which 
also contained the key to many religious mysteries. That should 
speak to us in favour of the ‘man in the street’ of those days 
His settling at Oxford is the point at which it is necessary to take 
an observation, to use a nautical expression, in order to determine 
Max Miller’s position in his voyage through life. He was under 
twenty-five, yet he had completed the transition from the Run-

taman principality ruled by Duke Leopold to England under the 
young Queen Victoria, to the Oxford of Jowett and Mark Pattison 
soon to be remodelled by Gladstone It was a remarkable feat for a 
man so young, so poor and so obscure, and the passage was no less 
long in terms of cultural distances than it was in space In Anhalt- 
Dessau he was in the Age of Enlightenment and Benevolent Des- 
potism, in England people were exulting over the march of industry, 
science and democracy He had also reached the place where he 
was to spend the rest of his life, and had at last ensured a means of 
living which would free him from literally praying for his daily 
bread 

But still he had not arrived at certainty or security He did not 
know how long he would remain at Oxford or in England, and he 
was not settled in a career which he could look upon as permanent 
The last billet was yet to be found Whatever he had obtained was 
promise, not fulfilment But that was the most significant feature of 
his early life and choices — his regular preference for freedom to 
pursue what he felt as his vocation, at the expense of security and 
ease He never played for safety, and paid no heed to the dictum 
that a bird in hand is worth two in the bush This sort of behaviour 
which worldly wisdom regards as perversity is not found in anybody 
who does not possess or, to be more correct, is not possessed by a 
very strong sense of vocation But this sense is not a rational driving 
force, it is always a supra-rational motive power, almost as compul- 
sive as submitting to love for a woman without knowing why 

But the strength with which such a sense of vocation can take 
hold of a man is wholly determined by his character and tempera- 
ment, which make him attack the eternal problems set by life in his 
particular way Nothing is more profoundly true than the saying 
that it avails nothing if you gam the world and lose your soul But 
it is also terrifyingly true that the first problem for a man is to re- 
main alive in the world before he can even dieam of conquering it 
So livelihood and vocation are always at loggerheads In this situa- 
tion most men concentrate on livelihood, raising it if they can to 
security and comfort, or finally to affluence and luxury* A minority, 
however, stick to vocation The former make their work conform to 
their means of livelihood, the latter contrive to gam livelihood out 
of their vocation. Certainly, it is the most difficult thing in life to 
make vocation and profession merge Max Muller had arrived at the 
starting-point of that process without achieving finality

It must however be pointed out that even this beginning would 
not have been possible solely through his own determination and 
effort, unless there was something in the spirit of the age that could 
help him At extremely critical points of his life he had received 
help which came to him as if by complete chance, and he had also 
received general aid and encouragement which he could not have 
reckoned on One has to admit that a young man in Muller’s posi- 
tion would never have got all this in our age Quite apart from 
ministers, politicians, eminent divines and men of letters, would a 
university don of today receive a penniless beggar such as Muller 
appeared in the eyes of the world ? Would any head of a college at 
Oxford invite to his house a young and unknown foreign scholar 
working in the Bodleian ? The truth of the matter is that in our age, 
m spite of all its talk about equality of opportunity and the iniquity 
of class distinctions, successful and established men are infinitely 
more exclusive, set-conscious, stand-offish and snobbish than men 
in their position were in any aristocratic age Our age has erected 
such psychological barriers between men of different positions 
that the outcome has been the creation of a rancorous hatred by the 
have-nots for what they call the ‘Establishment’, which is mis- 
takenly taken for a revolutionary movement Our times have 
recovered the primitive’s hostility for the ‘unlike’ Today an excep- 
tional man is swamped by sheer numbers The aristocratic age 
recognized classes, but never made them over-rigid Its elite needed 
new blood continuously, and so just as it maintained its economic 
prosperity by marrying into wealthy bourgeois families, it wel- 
comed talent to maintain its mental level 

There is always something mysterious about the rise of a man 
to fame and spectacular worldly success It presents such a complex 
interaction of circumstances and genius that it cannot be fully 
explained At the beginning nothing is seen nor even suspected. 
The ladder is hidden, but suddenly the heights reached are per- 
ceived, and then the whole process appears to be the result of some- 
thing like determinism When one considers how and where Max 
Muller began and where he finally arrived, his success and fame too 
would seem to have been due to predestination. After he became 
famous, young and struggling men wrote wanting to know how he 
had managed to keep his head above water and yet rise in life with- 
out sacrificing his independence or his vocation He gave a modest 
answer to this question in his autobiography, in which he said 



WANDERINGS OF YOUNG MAX MULLER 67 

‘Everything in my career came about most naturally, not by my 
own effort, but owing to those circumstances or to that environment 
of which we have heard so much of late/ That appears to be the 
theory of natural selection applied to personal success 

Max Muller had a clear idea of how this principle worked in 
England, and he could see the illustration of the process in the lives 
of many of his friends and acquaintances who rose to eminence in 
different lines More especially, he gave his explanation in regard to 
the fame and standing of Charles Kingsley, about whom he said that 
whenever a social or a religious or a great political question stirred 
the people, they thought of Kingsley Nothing in Kingsley’s 
worldly position could have given him this influence, but only the 
view generally held of the quality of his mind and character 

Now, Max Muller attributed the creation of such a view to a ‘very 
minute organization of public feeling in England’, of which, he 
added, people abroad had no idea Then he described the basis of 
this organization 

This close intellectual organization is favoured in England by many 
circumstances The number of public schools is limited Of the univer- 
sities there are, or there were till lately, two only Most men of note are 
acquainted with each other from school or from university, and who- 
ever has gamed the trust and love of his friends at Eton or Oxford, 
retains it mostly through life Add to this the innumerable societies, 
clubs, charitable institutions, political associations, and last, not least, 
the central hearth in London, Parliament, where everybody appears 
from time to time, if only to have a warm shaking of hands with old 
friends and acquaintances, and you will understand that England 
hangs more closely together and knows itself better than any other 
country in Europe As a natural result of all this there is a very sharp 
control A man who has once attracted public attention is not easily 
lost sight of 

This is a very perceptive account of the social and psychological 
process in nineteenth-century England which promoted men of 
talent from private to public status and function, and it certainly 
leads to the conclusion that a social and intellectual elite can do 
much more to utilize the available talent among a people than an 
egalitarian community 

Anyway, through his life at Oxford Max Muller had come into 
close contact with many Englishmen who belonged to this dlite

working as a clearing house of ability Besides, he had also secured 
the good opinion of men in his line who counted, in Berlin, Pans 
and London In his personal affiliations he was well placed, and it 
now depended only on him as to how high he would rise 


### FORMATION OF MIND AND CHARACTER
Chapter 3 

FORMATION OF MIND AND CHARACTER 


When Max Muller ended his wander] ahre by taking up residence 
at Oxford, he was six months short of being twenty-five, and his 
personality, in its dual aspect of mind and character, was already 
formed in its structure and functioning After that, so far as his own 
development was concerned, he was to go on adding to the content 
of his mind But henceforth he was also to give his mind a new role 
— that of impinging on other minds as teacher and writer The 
publication of the first volume of his edition of the Rig-Veda in 
1849 was symbolic of his transition from purely internal growth to 
external projection, which gained strength from year to year until 
m the last quarter of the nineteenth century he came to be accepted 
as one of the outstanding figures in the world of European thought 
At this point of transition it is necessary to take stock of his mind 
and character as these were then, and also to consider the influences 
which shaped them Perhaps the scope of this chapter will be more 
correctly stated if I say that in it I shall analyse young Muller’s 
personality as the product of a historical process What was dis- 
tinctively personal in his qualities and activities will come out of the 
whole account of his life What it is necessary to examine here is the 
relationship between his personality and the particular environ- 
ment, both social and psychological, in which he grew up This 
alone can place his individuality in its rightful historical setting 
The particularity of individual human-beings is geneially very 
much exaggerated, and in regarding every person as unique, as he 
in one sense certainly is, it is invariably forgotten that his particularity 
is only the psychological counterpart of what is known as continuous 
somatic variation in zoology, which makes every cat or dog equally 
particular It is only in the case of very exceptional persons that it is 
safe to attribute true individuality, and even then it cannot be 
assumed absolutely, for such men would also be found to be the 
products of a particular historical process Real originality is the 
surplus value which enables the exceptional man to give an added 
momentum to the process of which he is the product. 

The foundations of Max Muller’s mental life were laid in 



70 SCHOLAR EXTRAORDINARY 

Anhalt-Dessau, and under the control of the social and geographical 
environment which that principality constituted He made a symbolic 
confession about this himself He wrote in his autobiography, pub- 
lished after his death, that the Dessau dialect remained with him for 
life, and his friends told him that though he had spoken English and 
French for years they could always detect from his German accent 
that he came from Dessau or Leipzig One might add that there 
remained a dialectal or local accent in his thinking and feeling 

The first evidence of this is to be found in his religious beliefs 
All of pre-Reformation Christianity in the Protestant parts of 
Germany was remoulded by Lutheranism, which I might describe 
as the transforming of the deep, dark, warm and mysterious forest of 
German medieval Christianity into the good arable land of Protes- 
tantism Those who adopted this form of Christianity also thought 
that it was the most basic, simple and therefore indestructible form 
of the religion Luther himself was thought of by these Protestants 
as a saint His hymns were sung in churches, and seemed to singers 
and listeners alike to be little different from the psalms of David 
This musical expression of Lutheramsm reached its fullness in 
Bach Sharing the worship of Luther at Dessau, Muller was shocked 
when after coming to Oxford he found him spoken of as just another 
mortal, or even as a heretic, and a most dangerous one at that 

Max Muller came into his Protestant religious inheritance at 
Dessau through his mother, to whom he owed all the practical side 
of his religion He came to hold the view very strongly that any true 
religious feeling can only be planted deeply at home, and by a 
mother even more than a father Max Muller also believed that the 
sense of a divine presence everywhere, once implanted in the heart 
of a child, remains for life 

So it was with him His simple faith remained unshaken through 
all storms As he himself put it Tn its extreme simplicity and child- 
ishness it answered all the purposes for which religion is meant ’ It 
seemed to satisfy all his religious needs So what he read later in 
Strauss or Ewald, Renan or Colenso, never disturbed his faith or 
his life with and in God Nor was he interested in the question of the 
improbability of the Christian miracles, which for many of his con- 
temporaries had a crucial bearing on faith He wrote 

Suppose it was proved to me that, on geological evidence, the earth 

or the world could not have been created in six days, what was that to 



FORMATION OF MIND AND CHARACTER 71 


me ? Suppose it was proved to me that Christ could never have given 
leave to the unclean spirits to enter into the swine [on the assumption 
that He could not be so unjust and unkind to innocent animals] what 
was that to me ? Let Colenso and Bishop Wilberforce, let Huxley and 
Gladstone fight about such matters , their turbulent waves could never 
disturb me, could never even reach me in my safe harbour 

So he remained outside the religious controversies of Oxford , and 
the crises of faith which formed an essential part of Oxford’s re- 
ligious life never touched him He could never share the doubts 
and agonies of his friends at Oxford — Froude, Liddon, Clough, 
Arnold or Kingsley — and he even tried to show them how self- 
made their difficulties were His own faith had little burden to 
carry, and no impedimenta bore it down 

This kind of faith made him take the duty of church attendance 
more or less lightly, and this attitude, he said, was typically German 
‘The religious and devotional element,’ he wrote, £ is very strong in 
Germany, but the churches are mostly empty A German keeps his 
religion for weekdays rather than for Sunday ’ 

At a higher level his simple faith made him suspicious both of 
the Church and of theology This was stated by him most emphati- 
cally, not in any formal pronouncement on religion, but in his novel 
Deutsche Liebe ( German Love) Its hero, who certainly represented 
Muller’s own feelings, says 

The cause of many heated and violent conflicts lies in this, — that the 
doctrine of Christ, instead of winning our hearts gradually and irresis- 
tibly as it won the hearts of the Apostles and early Christians, meets us 
from our earliest childhood as the incontrovertible law of a mighty 
Church, and claims from us an unqualified submission, which we call 
faith Doubt will arise sooner or later in the breast of every one who 
has the power of reflection and veneration foi truth, and then whilst 
we are just in the right way to gam our faith, the spectres of doubt and 
unbelief rise before us, and hinder the quiet growth of the new life 

He always made a distinction between the Christ of faith and the 
Christ of the Church and formal theology He set forth the distinc- 
tion in a letter he wrote to his wife after she and his second daughter, 
Mary, had seen the Passion Play at Oberammergau in 1880. He 
wrote* ‘It must have been very powerful — and I feel sure just now 
nothing is more wanted than to be powerfully impressed with the 



72 SCHOLAR EXTRAORDINARY 

truly human character of Christ It has almost vanished under the 
extravagant phraseology of hymns and creeds — and yet how much 
greater is the simple story of his unselfish life than all the super- 
latives of later theology 5 

The same opinion he repeated to Renan in another letter ‘My 
wife and daughter are still away, they were quite overpowered by 
the Passion Play at Oberammergau We have lost far too much of 
the reality of Christ, and I have always thought that your work has 
done most good by restoring that reality, so far as it can be, in dia- 
metrical opposition to Strauss 5 

This feeling had begun to grow on him very early in life, and he 
put it quite explicitly in the novel ‘It is only a wonder, 5 to quote its 
hero again, ‘that theologians have not yet deprived us of all religion, 
and they will do so if the believers do not determmately oppose 
them, and say to them, “Thus far, but no further 55 5 Though he 
knew that each church must have its ministers, he had also learned 
from history that ‘there has as yet been no religion in the world 
which the priests — the Brahmans, the Shamans, the Bonzes, the 
Lamas, the Pharisees and Scribes — have not corrupted and de- 
stroyed They quarrel and argue in a language which is incompre- 
hensible to nme-tenths of their community 5 

He quoted with approval the saying of an English writer that 
‘truth makes revelation and not revelation truth 5 , and so if certain 
writings were required to be accepted by believers as the inspired 
truth and as the basis of the only saving religion, the question arose 
as to how anybody was to be sure that they weie inspired without 
imputing to himself an equal degree of inspiration ? They could 
avoid doing this only by admitting inspiration in the Apostles and 
early Fathers But that, too, was bound to raise the question of how 
was one to know which early bishops weie inspired and which were 
not In the end, the last desperate step was unavoidable, to accept 
apostolic succession by the laying on of hands as the channel of 
inspiration, making all inward conviction, all self-surrender, all 
faithful introspection superfluous 

His Lutheranism made Muller unsympathetic even to medieval 
German mysticism which gave expression to one of the most beauti- 
ful aspects of Christianity in Germany He could not share the 
current admiration for the Theologia Germanica , whose authorship 
was unknown So, in his novel, he made the hero say that according 
to his feeling it was wanting in the sense of the human and the real. 



FORMATION OF MIND AND CHARACTER 73 

‘The whole mysticism of the fourteenth century/ he said, ‘seems 
to me useful as a preparation, but it fiist attained its solution in that 
manly and courageous return to actual life which we find in Luther ’ 
Muller would have none of the ecstasy in annihilation which is 
the essence of Christian mysticism He accepted it as the first step 
‘Man must, once in his life/ he said, ‘perceive nothingness, he must 
feel that of himself he is nothing, that his being, his beginning, his 
eternal life, are rooted and hid in something supra-terrestrial and 
incomprehensible 5 But that negative return to God could never 
lead to the goal, though it could create a divine longing after a true 
home The truth was that man could not abolish the act of creation, 
as the mystics desired Though formed from nothing, that is to say, 
by and of God alone, he could not through his own power return to 
nothing, and the self-annihilation of which the mystics spoke was 
hardly better than the Buddhistic Nirvana 

But this annihilation of the creature was not the will of the Creator, 
for He had created it ‘God makes Himself into man/ says St Augus- 
tine, ‘not man into God * Mysticism should only be, as the ordeal by 
fire, to steel the human soul, not to dissolve it away into vapour like 
boiling water in a cauldron He who had perceived the nothingness of 
Self should also recognize this Self as a reflex of the truly divme Self 

But the invalid princess to whom the hero of Deutsche Ltehe says 
all this, replies ‘Health and strength are required for your faith, 
but there are also life-weary souls who long for rest and sleep, who 
feel themselves so lonely, that when they fall asleep in God they will 
miss the world as little as the world will miss them ’ 

That was the crux of the matter Max Muller’s faith belonged to 
a robust and active world in a particular age There was, however, 
m him a very strong mystical element or predisposition, but his 
religious conviction did not want to admit it So it passed over to his 
mode of thinking All his speculation, even though it concerned 
language, had a supra-rational streak in it, and he might be said to 
have been a mystic in philosophy, or for that matter in linguistics 
But this line of thinking and feeling about Christianity did not 
make Muller reject the historical approach to the religion In fact, 
there was no question of his rejecting that approach during the 
course of his education at school and university At school his 
religious teaching was chiefly historical and moral So from his 
earliest youth he was taught to look upon Christianity as an historical 



74 SCHOLAR EXTRAORDINARY 

fact, on Christ and his disciples as historical characters, on the Old 
and New Testament as real historical books 

At the university stage the historical study of Christianity became 
as familiar as the study of Roman history The professors he looked 
up to as great authorities, such as Lotze and Weisse at Leipzig and 
Schellmg and Michelet in Berlin, left him with a firm conviction 
that the Old and New Testaments were historical books which 
should be treated in accordance with the same critical principles as 
any other ancient books, including the sacred texts of the East He 
was taught to see that they contained only what, under the con- 
ditions in which they were written, they could contain, namely, a 
number of traditions of great antiquity collected by men who 
gathered together all that they thought would be useful for the 
education of the people As a result of this teaching, Muller left 
behind him the idea that the Christian scriptures contained revela- 
tion in the sense that they were verbally communicated by the 
Deity. What occupied his mind at that stage were questions as to the 
date and authorship of these books and the historical sequence of 
the doctrines embodied in them 

This shows that Muller was coming into the great movement of 
thought regarding Christianity which had been started at the end of 
the eighteenth century by Reimarus with his tentative attempt to 
distinguish between the historical Jesus and the theological Christ 
In this antithesis Max Muller did not go over to the historical 
school entirely In fact, after leaving university, he became some- 
what suspicious of it During his stay in Pans he frequently dis- 
cussed the historical aspect of Christianity with Renan, who was 
already adumbrating his idyllic view of Christ and his imaginative 
reconstruction of Judaism and Christianity By that time Muller 
had moved to the philosophical stage of his mental growth Under 
the influence of Kant, he was thinking more about the limits of 
knowledge, even in respect of the early history of Chnstianity, than 
of the specific problem of the date of, for instance, the fourth gospel 
Renan and Muller agreed that the evidence on the life of Jesus and 
on what he actually taught was very slender But while Renan still 
directed his attention to the historic aspect, Muller wanted to find 
out how the religious truths proclaimed by Christ could spring up 
m His mind at that time He doubted very much whether any 
scholai would be justified in giving his interpretation of the life and 
teaching of Christ from the historical fragments at his disposal Pie 



FORMATION OF MIND AND CHARACTER 75 

objected to Renan’s idyllic leanings, and when his Vie de Jesus was 
published in 1863, he called the image presented in that book, 
‘Renan’s ghost, or rather his corpse of Christ’, which was very 
severe In the end Muller came to believe that each man had the 
right to believe in his own Christ, and to this view, he remained 
true, all through his life 

It was also from his Dessau upbringing that Max Muller derived 
the ethical counterpart of his religious principles — a simple and 
solid moral consciousness which developed robust convictions All 
through life nothing repelled him more than untruthfulness and 
deception, cowardice, idleness and self-mdulgence His sense of 
moral responsibility was very individualistic, due in part to the 
spirit of the age, but also to the fact that he grew up in a very small 
community In his autobiography Max Muller wrote that it was 
dangerous to go through life with so imperfect a knowledge of the 
world, and with so small a viaticum of wisdom None the less, all 
this stood him in better stead than a more sophisticated and complex 
view of life could have His early struggles were stark and bare, and 
they needed stark and bare qualities to be mastered Certainly, he 
could never have gone through what he had to endure and fight 
against without the aid of these elemental or even elementary pre- 
scriptions for tackling life As we have now seen, for practical pur- 
poses the only alternative to these moral precepts are sleeping 
tablets 

But even as a schoolboy Max Muller had begun to realize that 
however useful the moral rigidity of Dessau might be in practice, 
it could not be maintained in the sphere of moral concepts, for 
which a tenable view of moral evil was essential Curiously enough, 
this kind of introspection was set going within him by reading 
Goethe’s Wilhelm Meister in the last years of his school life He 
knew that his mother would not like his reading the book, and so 
he wrote. 

I had already said to myself that you would not be pleased that I had 
read Wilhelm Master, and in some respects you are quite right, not 
that it can exactly hurt me, but that it might occupy my thoughts too 
much On the evil influence of reading or other temptations, I could 
not point out any better passage than the Latin verse in Faust which 
Mephistopheles repeats to the student, that God is holy and good just 
because He knows what evil is This is very true if only further ex- 
plained, 1 e because He knows evil, He never commits it If we could 



76 SCHOLAR EXTRAORDINARY 

imagine that God did not know what sin and temptation are, we could 

not call Him God, for we should have an imperfect God 
So he assured his mother that the more dangerous things he read, 
the stronger he became to wage war against them He was, however, 
quite ready to admit his mother’s argument that it was foolhardy to 
throw oneself into temptations without thoroughly knowing oneself 
and ascertaimng how far one could stand firm This was a remark- 
able letter from a boy of some sixteen years 

Nevertheless, the moral rigidity of Dessau adhered to him in his 
dealings with other men, and it developed in him certain incapa- 
cities for living in the wider world into which he moved later He 
had to acquire the capacity to do so from painful experience At 
Dessau he saw those whom he liked, and those whom he did not, 
and there was no compulsion on him or anybody to cultivate un- 
pleasant fellow townsmen Therefore he did not become aware 
until very much later that in any community there might be a large 
intermediate group of people whom it was neither necessary to 
admire nor to despise, and with whom one could be civil without 
caring whether one met them again or not 

So, there giew up in his mind in his early years the image of a 
community divided into two classes, one quite perfect, pure as 
angels, and the other consisting of black sheep There were no inter- 
mediate links, no shading of light and dark As a result, he became 
used to approaching people with complete trust, and it took him 
many years before he learned to make allowance for human weak- 
ness He lost, as he admitted, many a charming friend because he 
weighed them in his rough Dessau balance At the end of his life 
he grew more tolerant, without losing his moral strictness He came 
to see that even disloyalty or untruth in certain circumstances 
might not be a deadly sin He realized that a man known to be 
guilty of falsehood to himself might yet be looked upon as perfectly 
honest and trustworthy by others He suspected also that moral 
severity could often be sharpened by self-mterest But this toler- 
ance did not come to him easily Nor did he have it when he came to 
Oxford at the age of twenty-five and most needed the capacity for 
making allowances 

On the other hand, the smallness of the human community in 
Dessau developed in him a very strong awareness of personal 
responsibility for social welfare To help others was a duty, and he 
considered that a tenth of his income should be the least that he

gave away in charity In his days of prosperity he far exceeded this 
sum To his mother and sister he was most generous, and though he 
preferred the best cigars he gave up smoking altogether in order 
that his ‘charity purse’, as he called it, might not suffer 

There was another attitude which influenced his social and poli- 
tical outlook, perhaps due also to his growing up in the small prin- 
cipality of Dessau and having associations with the ducal family It 
was what might be called his special brand of royalism Max Muller 
came to know a large number of monarchs, from emperors to 
princes, and generally regarded them with respect and appreciation 
He also enjoyed his acquaintance with them, and when he wrote 
or spoke about them, he did so not only with a certain amount of 
admiration, but also with deference He was often criticized for 
this, and described as too courtly or even sycophantic 

But Max Muller’s attitude to princes had no touch of obsequious- 
ness in it Nothing reveals his own attitude so clearly as a passage 
m a private book of thoughts which he maintained over years after 
the death of his eldest daughter In this book, written in his own 
hand, I read under the date May 2, 1881, the following observa- 
tions in regard to Disraeli’s relations with Queen Victoria ‘Nothing 
is so dangerous in England than a Minister who bids for Court 
favours — nothing easier — nothing therefore more contemptible. 
The true friend of royalty would speak out at Court more even than 
in Parliament, and nothing keeps up my faith in Gladstone so much 
as his unpopularity at Court It is due to such men as Gladstone 
that monarchy in England has a future ’ 

There was no consciousness of inferiority in Max Muller’s atti- 
tude to royalty, far less any readiness to be a flatterer His royalism, 
if it can be described as such, was a projection of his own notion of 
and belief in aristocracy 

It has been my good fortune to see a good deal of royalty during the 
whole of my life [he wrote] I say good fortune on purpose, for, with 
all the drawbacks inherent in court life, royal persons enjoy some great 
advantages Their position is assured and well defined It requires no 
kmd of self-assertion, and wherever they appear, they have socially no 
equals, no rivals, and hardly any enviers They seldom have any in- 
ducement to try to appear different from what they are, or to disguise 
what they think and feel A king or a prince does not generally want to 
become anything else, and as they want nothing from anybody, they 
are not likely to scheme, to flatter, or to deceive.

Of course, he was aware that there were differences among the 
royalty as among the commonalty But he said that many bishops 
displayed their mitres and crosiers before other people’s faces much 
more than kings waved their crowns or sceptres Many people who 
become something, he added, forget that they were already some- 
thing, and seem to assume that they were created afresh when they 
were made peers, temporal or spiritual The princes, on the other 
hand, were to their business born, they did not become royal, but 
were born royal 

Muller’s mental growth had begun when he moved to Leipzig 
and to a larger world in which he met many musical celebrities 
A new stage in his intellectual development was marked by his 
joining the University of Leipzig in 1841 Though he had done very 
well at school he also became aware when he went to the university 
that his school education was entirely passive He was now to pass 
from intellectual tutelage to freedom in educating himself 

He was not eighteen when he joined the university, but at school 
he had received a thorough formal grounding in classical philology 
He could understand both Greek and Latin with ease , he could also 
speak Latin easily, and follow the lectures of his professors when 
they delivered them in Latin But he could not resist the lure of 
unknown subjects, and spread himself over many of them even at 
the risk of attempting too much 

German students were required to keep what was called a 
Collegienbuch , in which the professors attested what lectures the 
student attended Muller preserved his book to the end of his life 
It contains an impressive list of subjects German literatuie, aes- 
thetics, anthropology, harmonic composition, Hebrew grammar, 
psychology, German grammar, medieval German literature, Hegel, 
modern history, Sanskrit grammar Sanskrit literature, Arabic 
grammar, the history of Onental literature In his second year the 
emphasis transferred to philosophy, and philosophy and Sanskrit 
were combined with history, both ancient and modern In his last 
term he began the study of both Persian and the Veda 

Finally, however, he had to decide what he would concentrate on. 
He found little to rouse his enthusiasm for Greek and Latin Eveiy- 
thmg seemed to him to have been done, there was no virgin soil left 
to plough, and as he significantly added, ‘no rums on which to try 
one’s own spade’, which showed that his mind was feeling the 
attraction of what might be described as^the archaeology of ideas. 



FORMATION OF MIND AND CHARACTER 79 

His work in Greek and Latin had been on established scholarly 
lines He respected his teachers in classical scholarship Fie saw 
that they taught the principles of criticism, both external and inter- 
nal, very thoroughly, and made the student realize what accuracy 
meant Rut he regretted that he had failed to acquire a larger know- 
ledge of Greek and Latin literature, and of the character and spirit 
of each author He wanted to break out of this closed world into 
the open air of a wider mental world So he betook himself to 
philosophy 

This was perfectly intelligible, for his natural interest was in 
ideas, and in language as the vehicle of ideas At that time, although 
Hegel had been dead for more than ten years, Hegelian fever still 
ran high To be a Hegelian was considered a sine qua non not only 
among philosophers, but also among theologians, men of science, 
lawyers, artists and everybody else who pretended to have any kind 
of mental life If Christianity in its Protestant form was the State 
religion of Prussia, Hegelianism was its State philosophy To be a 
Hegelian was supposed to be a help to advancement in life All the 
young spirits at Leipzig had heard of Hegel’s Idea, and looked to 
the dialectic process as the solution of all difficulties 

There followed a strong reaction, and even in Berlin Hegel’s 
standing suddenly collapsed After that no truly scientific man 
liked to be called a Hegelian 

Max Muller made a sincere and determined attempt to under- 
stand Hegel’s philosophy, especially the concept of the Idea and the 
dialectic method, and he had a very sound teacher, Professor Weisse, 
a Hegelian, but a sober one and as much a critic as he was an 
admirer. Weisse was convinced of the truth of the dialectic method, 
but differed from Hegel in its application From his study of history 
and philology Max Muller felt, like Weisse, that there was a contra- 
diction between the theories of Hegel and facts He was confirmed in 
this opinion by the teaching of a young professor at Leipzig, Lotze, 
whose Metaphysics he later got published by the Clarendon Press 
at Oxford 

The teaching of another professor, Drobisch, also served Muller 
as an antidote to Hegel Drobisch taught Herbart’s philosophy, 
whose chief object was to analyse and clear up concepts As Muller 
was occupied with the problem of language he was stimulated by 
the philosophy of Herbart to seek accurate definition of words But 
the kind of thinking which finally turned Muller away from Hegel

was historical In developing a historical attitude to the growth of 
human thought, Max Muller was influenced and guided by another 
professor, Dr Niedner, whose manual for the history of philosophy 
he found useful all through life In contrast with Weisse and 
Drobisch, the teaching of Niedner was wholly historical This 
appealed to Muller, and as he said, his own philosophical interest 
became strong and healthy only after he had heard the lectuies of 
Niedner 

Meanwhile, his special philological interest had also taken a turn 
which was to lead him to a study of the early history of languages 
and of thought The immediate impulse came from his desire to 
take up some language which others did not know, and he tried 
three Oriental languages Finally he chose Sanskrit as his own 
special field, prompted by an inner urge which came from an early 
experience, combined with a very important aspect of the spirit of 
the age the rising interest in India 

When he was a small boy at Dessau, one of his copybooks had a 
large picture of Benares on the outside It was a very rough picture, 
but he could still see the figures of men, women and children as 
they stepped down the ghats to bathe in the waters of the Ganges 
As everyone who has seen that view knows, it is one of the most 
moving and impressive to be seen in all India The picture caught 
Muller’s fancy He had already heard about India, but knew nothing 
more than that the people were black, that they burnt their widows, 
and that to go to heaven they had first to be mangled under the 
wheels of the car of Juggernaut At Leipzig University a remem- 
bered vision of childhood was reawakened when he heard that a 
chair had recently been established for Sanskrit Afterwaids he also 
saw lectures advertised by Professor Brockhaus 

He had heard also about Hindu philosophy, though very vaguely 
Afterwards he had read Schlegel’s Uber die Sprache und Weishett 
der Indier published in 1808, and Wmdischmann’s Die Philosophte 
in Fortgange der Weltgeschichte (1827-34), both pioneering books 
which had ushered in new ideas, and left on many minds, as they did 
on Muller’s, a feeling that new fields were waiting to be prospected 
which would yield gold if only there were the people to dig This 

general inclination took a practical form when Muller heard of the

been easy to institute it, for at that time there was a good deal of

prejudice in scholarly circles against Sanskrit, especially among the 
classical scholars The number of men who stood up for it were still 
very small, though they were all eminent, e g , Wilhelm von Hum- 
boldt, and the two Schlegels 

But Brockhaus was established at Leipzig, and Muller called on 
him, and got himself enrolled There were only two other students 
to attend the lectures, both very much his semor One was Spiegel 
who became a Professor of Sanskrit as well as Zend, and Klengel, 
a scholar, philosopher and musician, who gave up Sanskrit after a 
term or two He encouraged Muller, however, and told him that 
something might be made of Sanskrit by a philologist and a philo- 
sopher So, under Brockhaus, he began with simple grammar and 
went as far as the Rig-Veda 

With the choice of Sanskrit as his mam scholarly pursuit, Muller’s 
vocation, and with it his profession, became, so to speak, predeter- 
mined But even in Sanskrit his interest was not to be purely 
linguistic In the university, it has been seen, his dislike for formal 
classical philology was strengthened On the other hand, his inclin- 
ation for philosophy grew, and for a time he thought of becoming 
a philosopher Thus, dreaming of a chair of philosophy in a German 
university, he began to feel that he must know something which 
other philosophers did not know, and having heard of Oriental 
philosophy he was led to learn Oriental languages, and finally 
settled down to Sanskrit 

This wider background to his philological studies must never be 
overlooked, and from the very first he thought of his knowledge of 
Sanskrit as a key to another mental world By the time he came to 
Oxford to deliver his address before the British Association, this 
view of philology was fully developed in his mind Technically, his 
paper was on the linguistic affiliation of Bengali, whether it belonged 
to the Indo-European family or not But while trying to establish 
that it did, he was fully aware of the immensely wider background 
of the question So he said 

What does it matter whether Bengali belongs, by its grammatical 
structure, to the Indo-Germamc or the Turkish family of languages, 
provided that a man knows enough of it to express what he wishes ? 
My answer is this from comparing languages, from finding out ana- 
logies between them, from tracing the origin of forms in modern 
languages down to the living roots of more ancient languages, and from 
going back, as far as it is allowed to us, to see the first mamfestation of

the human mind by human speech, we derive, I think, a threefold 
advantage — an historical, practical, and philosophical 

According to him the historical gam was this 

When poetical tradition is silent, when historical recoids are lost, when 
physiological researches fail, language will speak and decide whether 
there has been a community and connection in the intellectual develop- 
ment of different people 

The philosophical vista opened out was even vaster 

Language stands in the system of the intellectual world as light stands 
m the system of the physical world, comprising all, penetrating all, and 
revealing all There is more indeed to be read in human language itself 
than in anything that has been written in it 

Thus he thought that a scientific study of language would help 
to reveal the prehistory of the human mind, and disclose the mental 
affinities of different human groups Actually, in this paper written 
before Muller was twenty-four, the whole sweep of his scholarly 
career is already foreshadowed 

By that time he had not only arrived at a definite idea of his 
scholarly interest, but also of the kind of life he wanted to live It 
could only be a life devoted to thought and contemplation Even at 
school his ideal was that of a monk, undisturbed in his monastery, 
surrounded by his books and a few friends But as there were no 
Protestant monks among whom he could become a Protestant 
Benedictine, he thought he would become an assistant in a large 
library. From a very early period of his life he became conscious 
of the narrow horizon of human life on earth, and the purely pheno- 
menal character of the world in which he assumed he was to move, 
live and have his being for only a few years 

Such a view of life neither did nor could exclude music, not only 
as an accepted element but also as a theoretically justified element, 
for Muller came in the end to hold a supra-rational view of music 
It remained an enjoyment to him, and more than that, a spiritual 
experience He grew into the belief that music was, of all the arts, 
the least worldly, that it was not of this earth at all He saw that 
music was not an art of imitation and that it did not reproduce, im- 
prove or sublimize (as he put it) anything that we could hear with 



FORMATION OF MIND AND CHARACTER 83 

our ears in the external world, not even the song of a lark So he 
declared that neither history nor evolution could help anybody to 
account for Schubert’s Trockne Blumen , and he added that Schu- 
bert’s melodies were picked up, not in the Prater, but in another 
world In simple words, Muller thought that music was an absolute 
art, even in its vocal form 

He began with Haydn, Mozart and Beethoven, lived on Men- 
delssohn, rose to Schumann, and reached even Brahms But he 
never learned to enjoy Wagner, except, as he qualified his statement, 
m his lucid moments He confessed his failure with Wagner in these 
words T have tried in vain to find out what prominent music con- 
noisseurs admire in Wagner I have shunned neither time nor 
trouble, but without results, the swamp in which we find a few 
lilies is too deep for me ’ 

At all events, he admitted that enjoyment of music was very much 
a matter of habit He himself was most happy in the early morning 
of romantic music in Beethoven and Schubert In his enjoyment of 
execution too Max Muller remained attached to the early nineteenth 
century He shied at the virtuosity which was ushered in by Liszt, 
and sighed for an allegro or andante by Haydn or Mozart played as 
they were in his young days with simplicity on very imperfect in- 
struments As he grew older and had to hear more and more tech- 
nically faultless playing he thought that these performers thought 
more of themselves than of the musician-poets whom they were 
rendering He recalled that with all their technical skill even 
Mendelssohn and Clara Wieck (Schumann) acted only as faithful 
interpreters Therefore even when he listened to the exquisite 
performances of these latterday virtuosi, he himself thought more 
of what they were playing than of how they were playing 

When Max Muller settled at Oxford at the age of twenty-four, 
music was still an active pursuit for him, but in the next five years 
he found that he had to be economical of his time and he gave up 
many things which were a pleasure to him So in November 1854 
he wrote to his mother about his musical interest* 

One’s delight in music always lasts, and I owe the old instrument so 
much — not only the enjoyment one has had, and the use my music 
has been as an introduction in a foreign place, but also the happy frame 
of mind which music unconsciously produces in one, and it smooths 
many little roughnesses which one often sees in those who have no taste 
for music People who cannot smg are almost as badly off as people

who cannot cry, but one does not always want to cry, nor always to smg , 
if we know we can, it is enough 

So far the mental development of Max Muller has been traced as 
it proceeded from his own internal impulses, but these very im- 
pulses were also the products of the spirit of the age, and in their 
expression were wholly controlled by the same spirit Therefore 
it is now necessary to examine the movement of the human mind, 
the European mind, in the age in which Muller grew up The most 
important movement was the Romantic Movement, and it may be 
stated as a brief enunciation of the formation of Max Muller’s 
mind that he was a child of that movement 
' I do not think there is, even now, a full realization of the sweep, 
depth and significance of the Romantic Movement, and of its revo- 
lutionary impact on the European mind Actually, it was a new 
force in the evolution of European civilization I regard it as the last 
Renaissance of Europe, as the final phase of the development of the 
European mmd in the long historical process that began with the 
fall of the Roman Empire It was certainly not less important than 
the Renaissance, and its impact on the human spirit rather than on 
human activity, was more creative than that of the French Revo- 
lution 

It stimulated every aspect and kind of mental activity, passional, 
ratiocmative, scholarly, imaginative and artistic, and gave to each a 
special motivation, method and expression Under its influence 
people loved and worshipped differently, studied and taught dif- 
ferently, wrote books and composed music differently, and all these 
departures from the established pattern were made possible be- 
cause, in the first instance, it created a different type of European 
mmd which would not stay within the limits set by the eighteenth 
century To the Romantics the eighteenth-century attitude, the 
classical attitude, the rational attitude, the whole extrovert thinking, 
feeling and moralizing of the Aufklarung seemed to make a man an 
object with surface and no depth So the Romantics deprecated 
rationalism and extolled intuition, thought little of sense but much 
of sensibility And in their groping and unsystematic way, they 
even dived down mto the subconscious long before Freud 
Any sudden or fresh intensification of feeling and thinking within 
an individual makes him first of all aware of himself as the most 
vivid reality and, realizing the truth of the philosophical dictum 



FORMATION OF MIND AND CHARACTER 85 

cogito, ergo sum in his throbbing being, he also becomes egoistical, 
and at times even goes over to an egregious puppyism The Roman- 
tic Movement glorified the self above everything else, and naturally 
it arrived at the conviction of the autonomy and irrepeatability of 
the individual From this it was only one step to the feeling that the 
most valuable thing foi an individual was experience in itself, 
rather than the fruit of experience A book like Senancourt’s Ober- 
man would not have been possible without a new attitude towards 
introspective brooding, even to the point of enjoying nothingness, 
vide et neant 

The trend continued in Amiel, whose Journal Muller enjoyed 
very much when it was sent to him by a friend, to whom he wrote 
in reply ‘A delightful book — how little we know of the untold 
wealth of the world ! In the eyes of the world, who is Amiel ? and is 
he not ten times richer than Lord Over stone ^ 

I am inclined to think of Walter Pater as fighting the battle of 
Romanticism belatedly at Oxford, and I am surprised neither by his 
quoting Novalis when the latter says, ‘Philosophiren, ist dephlegma - 
tisiren, vivifiaren’ (To philosophize is to dephlegmatize and vivify), 
nor at his being accused of Cyrenaicism or an unmanly hedonism 
by the Oxford of his times It is the Romantic credo that we read 
m the beautiful conclusion to his Studies in the History of the 
Renaissance . 

To burn always with this hard gem-like flame, to maintain this ecstasy, 
is success in life Failure is to form habits, for habit is relative to a 
stereotyped world, meantime it is only the roughness of the eye that 
makes any two persons, things, situations, seem alike With this 
sense of the splendour of our experience and of its awful brevity, 
gathering all we are into one desperate effort to see and touch, we shall 
hardly have time to make theories about the things we see and touch 

If the Romantic Movement enlarged the mind internally by 
diving or dredging deeper within it, externally the widening was 
brought about by sending it wandering into space and time The 
Romantics broke out of the mental baroque palaces and formal 
gardens of the eighteenth century to move into all nature, even the 
wildest They heard the call of the far-off In the same way they 
wanted to go far back in time They could not accept the restricted, 
over-rationalized, abstract and didactic views of man and of human 
affairs current in the eighteenth century, and by exploring both

space and time they wanted to discover both the Total Man as the 
product of a flux and the Urmensch as its startmg-pomt 

Basically, the Romantic Movement everywhere was a reassertion 
of the Germanic element in European civilization after its relative 
suppression in the Age of Enlightenment Therefore the German 
Romantic Movement is the Romantic Movement, just as the Italian 
Renaissance is the Renaissance But it was not only a reassertion of 
the Germanic element, it was also the most powerful and widest 
assertion of that element which gave the whole of European culture 
of the nineteenth century its particular expression The post- 
Napoleonic era was the epoch of the ideological hegemony of Ger- 
many in Europe This was in complete contrast to the political 
eclipse and even military decline of Germany in that age For the 
Germans themselves German politics up to 1848 was an arena of 
futility and disappointment, and to the rest of Europe it was a spec- 
tacle of pitiful ineptitude Even in the military sphere the prestige 
of Prussia created by Frederick the Great was wiped out by Jena 
In fact, the regeneration of the Prussian army begun by Scharn- 
horst did not become evident to the world till after 1866 and 1870 
But in the mental sphere the post-Napoleomc era was a penod of 
the self-assertion of the Germans in Europe ‘What a change,’ 
noted Treitschke, ‘from the days of Louis XIV when our nation 
had been forced to go humbly to school to all other nations of the 
West ’ 

Neither Treitschke’s German nationalism nor his unqualified 
championship of Prussia makes his summing-up of the spirit of the 
Romantic Movement and of its influence in Europe anything but an 
objective statement of historical facts, and it is as such that I quote 
the passage 

For the first time since the days of Martin Luther, the ideas of Ger- 
many once more made the round of the world, and now found a more 
willing acceptance than of old had the ideas of the Reformation 
Germany alone had already got completely beyond the view of the 
world order characteristic of the eighteenth century The sensualism 
of the days of Enlightenment had been long replaced by an idealist 
philosophy, the dominion of reason by a profound religious sentiment; 
cosmopolitanism by a delight in national peculiarity, natural rights by 
a recognition of the living growth of the nations, the rules of correct 
art by free poesy, bubbling up as by the natural energy from the depths 
of the soul, the preponderance of the exact sciences by a new historico- 



FORMATION OF MIND AND CHARACTER 87 


aesthetic culture By the work of three generations, those of the 
classical and of the Romantic poets, this world of new ideas had slowly 
attained to maturity, whereas among the neighbouring nations it had 
hitherto secured no more than isolated disciples, and only now at 
length made its way victoriously through all the lands 


Such was the influence of this Germanic Renaissance that by the 
end of the nineteenth century it became impossible, as it still is 
today, to take any view even of the two most important non- 
Germanic elements in European civilization, the Graeco-Roman and 
the Christian, without taking account of the information and inter- 
pretation piovided by the Germans The foundations of modern 
classical and biblical scholarship were relaid by the intellectual 
effort set in motion by the Romantic Movement Curiously enough, 
even the art of war as practised by the supreme Latin, Napoleon, 
became Geimamzed through the writings of Clausewitz Max 
Muller’s own contributions to linguistics, mythology and religion 
were an extension of the German influence in these special spheres, 
as they were also the products of the Romantic Movement 
- The aspect of the Romantic Movement which is particularly 
relevant to Max Muller’s mental formation is its impact on intel- 
lectual activities in Europe, and, more especially, the result of the 
impact in three directions the creation of the historical attitude 
and the historiography of the nineteenth century, which made it 
the century for history, the appearance of a new motivation and 
spirit in scholarly pursuits, and, as an offshoot of these two, the 
exhibition of a deep and enthusiastic interest in the East and especi- 
ally India Of these, the third product will be dealt with in a later 
chapter Here I shall briefly consider the other two 

The relation between the Romantic Movement and the historical 
output of the nineteenth century will be found set out and explained 
m every book on the history of historiography in that century, but 
what I would stress here is the fact that the historical attitude itself 
was a contribution of the Romantic Movement to the writing of 
history Before that, history was of course written, but not in an 
historical spirit To give only one example, that most outstanding 
historical work of the eighteenth century, Gibbon’s Decline and Fall 
was a moral commentary in the spirit of eighteenth-century rationa- 
lism and on the events of an epoch of the past Its spirit was didactic 
and not historical. The conception of history as a process through 



88 SCHOLAR EXTRAORDINARY 

which humanity has reached its present state, and which is con- 
tinuously carrying it forward, came after the Romantic spirit and 
was created by it It was not only post hoc , but also propter hoc 

Nothing could be more natural A new interest in history was 
bound to be created by the Romantic’s yearning and respect for the 
past as a refuge from an unsatisfying present, and by his sheer 
enjoyment of the Middle Ages and other periods of the past as 
emotional experience The claims of the past as consciously asserted 
by the Romantic writers did not proceed from any arriere-pensee , 
but were accepted as self-justified But this interest had also behind 
it a revolutionary philosophical assumption regarding the nature of 
human phenomena of all kinds, the assumption being that these 
were organic, that is to say, things which were always growing, and 
were not finite wholes created at a particular point of time for all 
time This was bound to lead men to the past as the source of the 
present, and to write history to explain its character The apocalyp- 
tic attitude of the Romantics also helped history, for that attitude is 
only the historical attitude projected forward into the future But if 
any apocalyptic vision is to be convincing, the eschatology it formu- 
lates has to be a logical extension of past history with intuitional 
additions In fact, the apocalyptic attitude and the historical are 
closely connected in the psychology of a people, as was shown by 
the Jews 

The impact of the Romantic Movement on the spirit of scholar- 
ship was equally decisive and fruitful, especially in Germany 
There the Reformation virtually destroyed humanism, and for 
more than a century the religious wars hardly allowed the spirit of 
scholarship to keep itself alive Thus even the history of classical 
scholarship in the seventeenth century, the great century of scholar- 
ship, was virtually a blank page in Germany It was not till Leibnitz 
re-created it that the spirit of scholarly inquiry became general again 
m that country, and it was not till Gesner began to write and teach 
that a new humanism appeared there 

By that time, however, European scholarship had become as 
elaborate and as artistic an expression of the human mind as baroque 
architecture It had become a complex ciaft in the hands of Scaliger 
and Casaubon, and had been given a new technique by Mabillon, 
and also a new solidity by him and Tillemont, whose ‘inimitable 
accuracy’, as Gibbon put it, ‘almost assumes the character of 
Genius’ But all this stupendous and meticulous scholarship, most 



FORMATION OF MIND AND CHARACTER 89 

impressively represented in England by Bentley and Porson, was 
concentrated on books and not on life The monastic scholars did 
indeed go beyond books, but their interest was to illustrate and 
justify a static Church and its doctrines Basically, the object of both 
the secular and clerical scholarship of the pre-Romantic Age was 
collection of information, supplemented by exegesis In its elegance 
and economy, in its sheer virtuosity, this scholarship was like the 
superb singing of the castrato Farmelli — but it did not help men to 
live, nor was it fecund in renovating the will to live For that a 
different kind of scholarship was needed, which would be a voyage 
of discovery in space and time, and would discover ideas and facts 
to give a new meamng to life and lead to happiness This impulse 
of scholarship to transform itself came from the Romantic 
Movement 

In all the ramifications of his scholarly interests and researches, 
and even more in the special field of language, religion, mythology, 
including Indian religion and philosophy, Max Muller remained 
within the framework of scholarship created by the Romantic Move- 
ment He was historical as well as practical In fact, he became so 
historical that in the end the prehistory of the human mind became 
a greater preoccupation with him than history Almost at the end of 
his life, in a preface to the collected edition of his works (which began 
to be published early in 1898), he re-affirmed that the historical 
principle had been the essence of his method in all his inquiries 

During the last fifty years [as he wrote] I have never lost sight of the 
pole-star that guided my course from the first I wanted to show that, 
with the new materials placed at our disposal durmg the present cen- 
tury it has become possible to discover what may be called his- 
torical evolution, in the earliest history of mankind At the present 
moment it may truly be said that what is meant by evolution, or con- 
tinuous development, has now been proved to exist in the historical 
growth of the human mind quite as clearly as in any of the realms of 
objective nature Language, mythology, religion, nay, even philo- 
sophy can now be proved to be the outcome of a natural growth, or 
development, rather than of intentional efforts, or of individual genius 

In the previous year he had said the same thing in an interview 
given to a religious magazine ‘My interest in all religions is chiefly 
historical, I want to see what has been, in order to understand what 
is ’ Nothing could be more unambiguous

It was, again, his sense of historical continuity which made him 
justify his project of translating Kant’s Critique of Pure Reason , 
which many of his friends disapproved of as wasting time on a mere 
translation, by setting down in the preface his feeling of a connexion 
between this book and the Rig-Veda 

The two friends, the Rig-Veda , and Kant’s Critique of Pure Reason , 
may seem very different, and yet my life would have been incomplete 
without the one, as without the other The bridge of thoughts and 
sighs that spans the whole history of the Aryan world has its first arch 
m the Vedas, its last in Kant’s Critique While in the Veda we may 
study the childhood, we may study in Kant’s Critique of Pure Reason 
the perfect manhood of the Aryan mind 

On the other hand, the conviction that there must be a human 
motive even behind the most out-of-the-way inquiry into the past 
was also asserted by him in connexion with his edition of the Rig- 
Veda As early as 1864 he wrote to his wife 

I feel convinced, though I shall not live to see, that this edition of mine 
and the translation of the Veda will hereafter tell to a great extent on 
the fate of India and on the growth of millions of souls in that country 
It is the root of their religion, and to show what that root is, is, I feel 
sure, the only way of uprooting all that has sprung from it during the 
last 3,000 years 

It was this human approach to learning which made a parochial 
clergyman’s wife in America write to Max Muller’s wife after his 
death 

I feel almost as if I could burn incense daily to the memory of Pro- 
fessor Max Mullerl To me he lives, and of late in all my spare time I 
am reading his books, and learning what it is to think of the greatness 
of the love of the Eternal One , and more than any of the devotional 
books I have read, Max Muller’s teachings help me to understand 
what religion means You know that in the rush and whirl of what is 
called Church life, one does not reach the highest. In my own little 
room, with Professor Max Muller I spend all my leisure moments It 
is not his memory, but he himself, who in his strong, brave, beautiful 
life of searching for Truth, now helps me 

No scholar would have been read in this spirit if he had based his 
vocation only on the intellect Something beside and beyond that

was necessary, indeed by the time he settled at Oxford his intellec- 
tual quest had become part of his life of faith This is revealed in a 
letter written in Oxford on his twenty-fifth birthday by Muller to 
Bunsen 

Twenty-five years of this life he behind me today, and one feels in- 
voluntarily in a more earnest and solemn frame of mind at such a 
moment I look back with gratitude on the first half of my life, which, 
notwithstanding many sad moments, leaves me with the memory of a 
happy youth, and what at the same time, after many struggles, has 
given me a firm faith in a Divine Providence, trust in mankind and 
peace in myself, and cheerful courage to begin the second half of 
my life 

Actually, fifty-two years lay in fiont of him

EARLY YEARS AT OXFORD 

Max Muller came to Oxford in 1848, just in time to see the last 
years of the old, Laudian, Tory university, in which the part that 
was formally the university was a pool and almost unwanted relation 
of the colleges The year 1854, which saw the Oxford University 
Act become law on August 7, was as great a landmark in the aca- 
demic history of Oxford as 1832 (the year of the first Reform Act) 
was in the political history of the British people Old Oxford did 
not disappear at once, but a process of transformation was set in 
motion, to continue for at least three decades until a new Oxford 
took a stable form 

The first two of the six pre-reform years which Max Muller spent 
at Oxford were an interlude of peace for the old order The aca- 
demic community had recovered from the stir and strife caused by 
the Tractanan Movement, and though its ideas were to be absorbed 
by the Anglican Church both in spirit and form, for the present they 
were discredited by Newman’s going over to Rome in 1845 Some 
Oxford men still adhered to these ideas, but they talked about them 
in private. Muller, whose early friends belonged to the pro- 
Tractarian, as well as to the moie emancipated anti-Tractarian side, 
could hardly perceive the opposition between them until initiated 
by Froude and Jowett, and even they spoke with great reticence 

So, in coming to settle at Oxford in 1848, Muller could say in the 
words of Pope 

To happy convents, bosom’d deep in vines, 

Where slumber abbots purple as their wines 

The university was still a club — a religious, scholarly and epi- 
curean club for its teaching members , a recreational, sporting and 
talking club for its student members , and a social club for both It 
could serve as such because as a federation of colleges it was one 
of the greatest landowners of England, and supported its teachers 
on the income accruing from landed property The students too 
were overwhelmingly supported by their fathers from the same kind 
of income, either secular or clerical

Certainly Oxford also served the cause of education In any case, 
the education of the dominant minority in England was the exclu- 
sive function of the two universities It put the youth of that 
minority through the mental disciplines considered necessary for 
them, to profit or not to profit by them as they pleased It also 
formed the manners of the young men, without as yet shaping their 
character — which was typical of a social class brought ready-made 
to the university But it is quite inaccurate to say that the university 
created the great men of England simply because many of them 
passed through it Where else could the poor devils go ? In fact, 
Oxford did exactly for the young of the nobility, gentry and bour- 
geoisie of England what education in the convents did for girls 
belonging to the same classes in France After passing through the 
convents they could become saints, bluestockings, social figures, 
leaders of fashion, frivolous gadabouts, femmes galantes , or even 
demimondaines So with the English youth after passing through 
Oxford and Cambridge If one Earl of Pembroke was a benefactor 
of Oxford, another figures in Casanova’s memoirs 

When Muller went up Oxford was not a place which any great 
British mind had praised for about two hundred years The pro- 
nouncement of Giordano Bruno that Oxford was ‘the widow of 
true science’ might be passed over as the opinion of a foreigner, but 
one cannot dismiss Milton, Gibbon, Adam Smith, Sir William 
Hamilton, or for that matter Jane Austen Yet all of them speak of 
Oxford with either contempt or irony 

Derisive remarks, of course, are always made about persons and 
institutions which are too securely and solidly established The 
most important thing was that Oxford could take itself for granted, 
and it could even make others take it for granted Mud-slmgmg did 
no harm because the mud slipped down its granite face Oxford 
would take no more notice of this than its heads of colleges would 
mind the pranks of their undergraduates at the Commemoration or 
Encaenia The Monarchy, the Parliament before 1832, the Church, 
the aristocracy and the squirarchy all had similar status, and Oxford 
was only the clerical-pedagogic wing of a whole established order 
Max Muller soon became conscious of the educational short- 
comings of Oxford He wrote to his mother that it was more a high 
school than a university, and within a few months he wrote to Bun- 
sen ‘Oxford is most beautiful, but one longs for German professors, 
for Greek societies, and seminars ’ But at the same time his first and

strongest impulse was to admire He was overwhelmed by its 
grandeur, as well as the charm and sophistication of the academics 
As he wrote in his autobiography ‘My first years at Oxford were 
spent in a perfect bewilderment of joy and admiration To me it 
seemed a perfect paradise 9 

What he felt most grateful for was the kindness shown to him by 
many of the heads of colleges He was invited to their tables At that 
time three venerable figures represented the gerontocracy of Oxford 
The first of them was Dr Routh, President of Magdalen, who was 
ninety-three when Muller came to Oxford, and died in perfect 
possession of his senses in his hundredth year in 1854 In his best 
days he was a pillar of Anglicanism, and Newman dedicated his Via 
Media to him with the words ‘To in J Routh . who has been 
reserved to report to a forgetful generation what was the theology 
of their fathers 5 But in Muller’s time he was mostly seen at the 
window of his room in his wig and gown, and was heard only to 
talk of old times He spoke about Dr Johnson, whom he had actually 
seen, and of King Charles I as if he had A friend offered to take 
Max Muller to meet him, but Muller declined because he had learnt 
that the old man did not like to be shown as a curiosity 

After Routh came Dr Jenkyns, Master of Balhol, who began the 
rejuvenation of that college which Jowett was to complete The 
Master’s regard for his own dignity was very great Once he slipped 
and fell as he was returning from a walk, and two undergraduates 
rushed to help him up As they were laying their hands on him, he 
saw an in a coming and cried out ‘Stop, I see a Master of Arts 
coming down the street 9 Helped on to his legs by the in A , he dis- 
missed the undergiaduates with thanks He rebuked young 
Jowett, whom he found standing in his dining-room in gown and 
cap ‘Do my eyes deceive me, or do I see a gentleman in my dining- 
room with gown and cap on ^ But he also had a quiet sense of 
humour, and would say things without moving a muscle of his face 
which would make others laugh 

The third patriarch was Dean Gaisford, with whom Max Muller 
became more intimate than with the others, because he was made an 
M A of Christ Church Gaisford never taught and was absorbed 
wholly in textual criticism, and he also held the opinion that Greek 
promoted emoluments The report went about that he was un- 
reasonable in everything except philology, and versifiers mocked 
him when he wooed his beautiful wife But he himself said of his

95 


successor, Dean Liddell, who had also found that Greek helped 
emoluments, that Liddell 'had not found love and lexicography in- 
compatible’ He was quickly put out if he sensed disrespect towards 
himself, and Muller found it easy to believe the story that he had 
once said to an undergraduate who had come too close to him 'Get 
down from my hearthrug ’ 

But to Muller, a very young man, a stranger and a German, the 
Dean was uniformly kind While many of the heads of houses invited 
him to dinner by sending a card, Dean Gaisford first called on him 

One morning at about eleven o’clock when Muller had gone into 
his bedroom to shave and had his face half-covered with lather, his 
landlady rushed into the room to announce that the Dean had come 
to see him and was being pulled to pieces by Muller’s Scotch terrier 
and her puppies Muller ran out to find the dogs tearing the sleeve 
of the Dean’s gown and barking at him As there was no time to 
change, Muller received the Dean in the state he was in His guest 
did not mind, and listened as Muller told him what he was doing at 
Oxford After that the Dean inquired about an Icelandic dictionary 
which was being offered to the University Press 'Surely,’ the Dean 
said, 'it is a small barbarous island, and how can it have any litera- 
ture Icelandic studies had just begun, and Muller was able to ex- 
plain to him the value of the literature of Iceland The dictionary 
was accepted. 

At a later date, when asked whether he would put Muller’s name 
on the books of the house, the Dean at first hesitated, and asked him 
to come and see him When Muller did, he got this reply 'I have 
looked through the books, and I find two precedents of Germans 
being members of the house, one of the name of Wernerus and 
another of the name of Nitzschius, or some such name ’ So the 
Dean was very happy to admit Muller, who was afraid that, without 
a precedent, he might not be taken in But the Dean later told him 
that even if he had not found those names he would have acted as 
he did People were astonished when they heard of the Dean’s 
courtesy to Muller 

What overwhelmed Max Muller when he settled there was the 
magnificence of Oxford life Soon after his arrival he had his first 
experience of Commemoration, and he described it to his mother 

There were great festivities for the end of the term Guizot was here, 

two sons of Mettermch, Baron von Huge!, and many of the best English

families, and a crowd of such beautiful women as I have never before 
seen The festivities lasted from early dawn till midnight, the gardens 
lighted up, with music and singing, were enchanting There were good 
concerts, the Messiah , the Creation , in which Birch, Tadohnee, and 
Lablache sang , in fact it was magnificent, and champagne and hock 
flowed in streams 

It would seem from all this that Oxford in those days was nearer 
than it is today to what Matthew Arnold called the ‘Centre’ in re- 
gard to English social and cultural life, and its regular social life and 
entertainment impressed Muller These struck him as very sump- 
tuous As a poor student in Germany and France he was accustomed 
to the Spartan diet of a German convictormm or a dinner a deux 
francs at the Palais Royal, and he was confounded by the plate, the 
furniture, the carpets, curtains and the whole style of living of the 
dons of Oxford when they asked him to dine with them When in- 
vited to the houses of the heads of colleges, which he appreciated as 
a great honour, he found the company to consist of the other heads, 
canons, professors, and, at times, of distinguished persons from 
London, and even ladies of various ages and positions As he sat 
among them Max Muller felt lost or, as he put it, verrathen und 
verkauft He might well do so, for he was unused to this kind of 
life, and moreover, he was only twenty-five 

He saw other young men at these parties, in evening dress and the 
short gown of the undergraduate They stood together on one side 
of the room They were invited to join the company after dinner, 
and received a cup of tea Beyond this they were not noticed, and 
they themselves called the ceremony ‘doing the perpendicular’. Max 
Muller’s position was different, but after the dismissal of the under- 
graduates at about ten o’clock he would go and join them in their 
rooms, and would talk or smg in a more comfortable posture 
^ At one of the earliest dinners, which was informal and private, 
Max Muller met Thackeray A fellow of St John’s had arranged it 
expressly for the great man There were only four young men, all 
very much awed by him No one ventured to say a word, and 
Thackeray maintained his silence till the soup was over, though the 
others were expecting a brilliant sally from him every minute. At 
last at the commencement of the second course he looked at the fine 
John Dory which was waiting to be splayed on the table, turned his 
large spectacled eyes on Muller, and said ‘Are you going to eat your 
own ancestor All of them stared, and Thackeray, looking very 



EARLY YEARS AT OXFORD 97 

grave and learned, said, ‘Surely, you are the son of the Dorian Muller 
— the Muller who wrote about the Dorians, and was not John Dory 
the ancestor of all the Dorians There was general laughter, and 
Muller explained that he was not the son of Otfned Muller who had 
written about the Dorians, but of Wilhelm Muller who had written 
Die Homensche Vorschule and Die Schone Mullenn Then he per- 
petrated a joke as far-ranging as Thackeray’s ‘How could John 
Dory be their ancestor, because the original John Dory was II 
Janitore , that is, St Peter, who had no wife or would not acknow- 
ledge her in public, though he was kind to his mother-in-law ’ This 
wholly thawed Thackeray, who poured out his wit and sarcasm and 
told anecdote after anecdote, helping himself meanwhile to plenty of 
vinegar and cayenne pepper 

When Max Muller mixed with the undergraduates he felt as if he 
was one with them, though he was already becoming recognized as 
a scholar He could not say which years he enjoyed more, those at 
Leipzig and Berlin, or those at Oxford Very early in his stay there 
he even thought of formally enrolling himself as an undergraduate, 
though he was a doctor of Leipzig University of five years’ standing 
He wrote to Bunsen ‘I have an idea of entering one of the colleges 
as an undergraduate, keeping my twelve terms, and then taking my 
degree.’ He also wanted to take riding lessons so as to be able to 
join the crowds of students whom he saw pass by in their red coats 
and riding hats going to the hunt He had to give up the idea as it 
was expensive But as to the kind of life he led, he wrote in his 
autobiography ‘In Paris I was already something of a scholar and 
writer, at Oxford I became once more an undergraduate ’ 

He also wrote that it never struck him then that these young men 
had within them the germs of future greatness What struck him was 
the general tone and level of conversation There were many with 
whom he lived on terms of great intimacy who afterwards became 
bishops, ambassadors, judges, ministers Thinking of them in later 
life and remembering them as young men who were not so very 
different from others who through life remained wholly unknown, 
he wondered if he had slept through a number of years and suddenly 
awoke to a new life Some of his early friends he found to be the 
same, whether in ermine or in lawn sleeves , others, however, became 
different — the boy in them had vamshed, and nothing was to be 
seen except the bishop, the judge or the minister But he was so 
attached to them when he first met them at Oxford that he wrote 



98 SCHOLAR EXTRAORDINARY 

when they began to leave Oxford ‘My early Oxford friends, with 
whom I felt at home, leave one after another, and it is not worth 
while to make new acquaintances 5 To become indifferent to new 
acquaintances at the age of twenty-seven showed a considerable 
capacity for attachment to people 

There is also no doubt that the young stranger from Germany 
had great attraction for the dons and undergraduates of Oxford 
One of his early friends there wrote about him after his death 

Max and I were nearly of the same age, and I am now seventy-eight, 
with a memory, alas 1 no longer quick and vivid The figure of Max is, 
however, never dimmed in my vision Though near my age, I never 
looked on him as less than ten years older than myself in wisdom, tact, 
experience of life, and knowledge of men ‘King’ was the term Bunsen 
applied to him, and though he seems from the beginning to have lived 
with the Olympians, whether intellectual or social, it was they who 
sought him rather, I think, than he who climbed into their company 

A similar testimony comes from Canon Farrar, who wrote to 
Mrs Max Muller after his death about the occasion when he first 
met Muller 

I was dining with Jowett, and Max Muller with Walrond Though the 
talk during dinner was not strictly literary, some point of literature 
turned up, and Muller’s opinion on it was asked by Walrond Instantly, 
there was silence among the twenty men at table All listened to the 
stripling as he appeared Stanley who was sitting next to me, and who 
had been discussing the memoirs of Stirling, stopped and listened 
attentively Muller replied to the question with great modesty, though 
with self-possession, and with a brevity which allowed the conversation 
to flow back soon to its previous course I instantly asked Jowett who 
he was, and learned that he was a young German of great promise who 
had been at Oxford for about two years and was engaged in editing the 
oldest Sanskrit literature I name this as a sign of the profound respect 
which at so early a period was shown to him in an 61ite society like that 
of Balliol 

But it was not solely his learning that attracted people to him 
He had considerable social talent, and was a witty speaker and 
conversationalist Unfortunately, no record of this survives All the 
formal books by him are serious and solemn* because he did not like 
persiflage or even wit in serious discussion. He once said: ‘People 



EARLY YEARS AT OXFORD 


99 


do not know what a dangerous game this French persiflage is, par- 
ticularly in England, and how difficult it becomes to exchange it 
afterwards for real seriousness ’ That prevented him from showing 
his humorous side in his writings So there are only testimonies to 
his wit and humour, and virtually no examples 

Rut his greatest social qualification at Oxford in his early days 
was that he was musical, and a very fine player and singer himself 
In those days he had the entree to many Oxford drawing-rooms as a 
pianist, and chatter ceased at his brilliant touch People who knew 
nothing about the Rig-Veda knew him as a pianist In those days 
music was just beginning to be a part of Oxford life No don dared 
play an instrument, and an undergraduate still less The utmost 
length that the latter would go to would be to sing a song Yet there 
was love of music, though hardly any execution So Max Muller 
was much in demand There was only one other person in Oxford’s 
academic society who could play really well, and that was Professor 
Donkin As he was an invalid and was always regarded as dying 
nobody minded his playing So he and Muller were expected to 
make music at parties 

Muller hired a piano to keep up his practice, gave it up for want 
of time, and then had to hire one again because all his friends 
wanted him to play. In 1851 he actually bought an instrument, a 
grand square Collard, and through a friend got it for only £50 It 
was so large that it could not be carried up the stairs of his lodgings 
but had to be hoisted through a window When his friend Victor 
Cams came to stay at Oxford for a shoit time Max Muller and he 
would play violin and piano sonatas and keep hearers spellbound, 
for under Muller’s hands the sounds of the piano, as one of them 
said, became a poem in music 

So Muller’s popularity grew But there may have been another 
less consciously perceived factor which made for his popularity 
among the liberals of Oxford with whom he mostly associated This 
was the fact of his being a German Germans were not liked by the 
conservative Anglican churchmen, and were positively disliked by 
the High Church school created by the Oxford Movement whose 
leader, Newman, thought that Lutheranism and Calvinism were 
heresies. 

But it was quite the opposite in liberal circles For about a decade 
by the middle of the nineteenth century, Germanizing had become 
not only an intellectual trend but almost a fashion at Oxford All 



100 SCHOLAR EXTRAORDINARY 

the advocates of reform and of liberalism in theology and philosophy 
were called Germamzers by their opponents, and in a sense they 
were Jowett, for instance, went to Germany, became familiar with 
Hegel’s writings which were unknown at the time at Oxford, and 
came back determined to conquer this new world of thought He 
became the pioneer in the naturalization of Hegel’s thought which 
became the source of English philosophical speculation at the end of 
the nineteenth century 

The first step towards this end was a thorough mastery of the 
German language, which was rare in England at the time But the 
trend grew, and in Balliol it became almost an affectation to employ 
German for saying things which could equally well be said in 
English Max Muller’s future wife acquired real proficiency in the 
language at this time Even Pusey went to Germany in order to 
become familiar with the latest scholarship in theology and biblical 
studies, though only to become deeply distrustful of it Among 
Muller’s friends, Froude and Palgrave knew the language well In 
1849 he wrote to Palgrave that he wished he could read Goethe 
with him, and he added Tor my own sake, not for yours, for you 
are not the man to misunderstand him ’ This was a very handsome 
compliment to Palgrave’s knowledge of German 

Palgrave was one of Muller’s earliest friends at Oxford, and was 
of special help to him in guiding him in writing English His English 
compositions were always revised by Palgrave in the kindest possible 
manner, and it was this help which enabled Muller to write the 
language so well and to use it for all his major works When he left 
Oxford tojom the Education Department in London, Muller missed 
him very much None the less, he gave him news of Oxford* 

Oxford is flourishing again Stanley, Jowett, etc , are up Old Froude, 
however, has left a blank, and if you saw how they have pulled down 
your house, and how the fireplace where we smoked so many a jolly 
cigar is exposed to the eyes of the vulgas profanum , you would find it a 
subject not unworthy of an elegy Bye-bye, old fellow Don’t forget 
Oxford and the old set, who send you their love 

Another still more famous figure was one of Muller’s early Oxford 
friends That was Matthew Arnold. He admned Arnold to the end of 
his life, and wrote in his reminiscences that he was beautiful, strong 
and manly as a young man, and yet full of dreams and schemes 
Muller found it strange that nobody suspected his genius at the 



EARLY YEARS AT OXFORD 101 

time, and also that he never rose higher than an Inspector of 
Schools while many of his contemporaries became great political or 
ecclesiastical figures Arnold, however, never gave any thought to 
this He never asked for anything, but Max Muller thought that his 
friends should have done something for him to show that he had not 
been left behind in the worldly race Later in life, he wrote to in- 
fluential friends urging public recognition for Arnold 

Some verses written by Palgrave in 1851 show at its best and most 
touching the spirit of the friendship which sprang up between a 
foreigner and some of the most brilliant English young men of the 
day. Here are the lines 

An English welcome to an English shore 

Such as we could, some four years since we gave thee. 

Not knowing what the Fates reserved in store 
Or that our land among our sons would have thee, 

But now thou art endenizen’d awhile 

Almost we fear our welcome to renew 

Lest what we seemed to promise, should beguile, 

When all we are is open to thy view 
But yet if aught of what we fondly boast — 

True-hearted warmth of Friendship, frank and free, 

Survive yet in this island-circling coast, 

We need not fear again to welcome thee — 

So may we, blessing thee, ourselves be blest, 

And prove not all unworthy of our guest. 

If the experiences described so far were making Muller’s life 
happy in England, there were other things which he could not under- 
stand The first thing which surprised Muller at Oxford was the 
absence of duels, whose prevalence in the German universities he 
had defended At Oxford a man either apologized, or proved him- 
self a cad and was immediately dropped 

Another thing which almost shocked Muller was the disrespect 
of the students towards their teachers In the German universities 
the students almost worshipped their professors, and never ques- 
tioned their ipse dixit At Oxford Max Muller found that it was the 
common amusement of the undergraduates to make fun even of the 
heads of houses, and the doctors of divinity in their red gowns and 
black velvet sleeves were objects of the most outspoken disrespect. 
The looseness of undergraduate tongues at the Encaenia he accepted 



102 SCHOLAR EXTRAORDINARY 

as the Saturnalia of their university life, and he could even enjoy 
some of the remarks he heard at the beginning His first experience 
of this was when Dr F Plumptree, as Vice-Chancellor, stood up to 
address the audience in the Sheldoman His first words were not 
quite distinct, and the undergraduates shouted ‘Speak up, Old 
Stick 5 Dr Plumptree was very tall and stately 

Max Muller himself was subject to some good-natured leg-pulling 
too on account of his ignorance He had noticed the letters fp on 
boards at a height of about ten feet at many places in the streets 
They stood for ‘Fire Plug’ But when he inquired, his friends told 
him that they indicated the height of the very tall Dr Frederick 
Plumptree 

He also found the constitution of the university very puzzling 
In Germany no university could do without a Minister of Educa- 
tion to appoint professors, or without a Royal Commissioner to look 
after the undergraduates and their moral and political sentiments 
At Oxford he was told that the only ruling power consisted in the 
Statutes of the University Professors and tutors were free so long 
as they conformed to these Statutes ‘If we want a thing done/ his 
friends told him, ‘we do it ourselves, as long as it does not run counter 
to the Statutes ’ 

Then the practise and profession of religion at Oxford baffled 
Muller When he came to Oxford he was strongly recommended 
to Dean Stanley on the one hand, and to Manuel Johnson the Ob- 
server (the University Astronomer) on the other Johnson was in 
the High Church Movement, and in his house Muller met all its 
leaders Stanley was a liberal, and received him very kindly as the 
friend of Bunsen, F D Maurice and Hare. At first Muller could 
not understand that he was dealing with two camps At Johnson’s 
as well as at other places he heard a kind of discussion he could not 
connect with the true religious spirit. He was puzzled to see men 
whose learning and character he sincerely admired, absorbed in sub- 
jects which, to his mind, seemed merely childish He expected he 
would hear from them some new views on the date of the gospels, 
the meaning of revelation, the historical value of revelation, or the 
early history of the Church But of all this he heard not a word 
Nothing but discussions on the validity of the Anglican orders, on 
vestments, genuflexion and candles, on the altar being made of wood 
or stone, of consecrated wine being mixed with water, of the pnest 
turning his back on the congregation, etc. Of the historical approach 



EARLY YEARS AT OXFORD 103 

to Christianity with which he had become familiar in his country, 
there was no trace In his bewilderment, he asked both Johnson and 
Stanley what all these things had to do with true religion, but was 
advised by them to keep aloof and say nothing 

Though Muller’s simple Lutheran faith was bound to make him 
unsympathetic to ritualism, he could see where the desire for an 
elaborate ritual came from His friend Johnson constantly com- 
plained about the monotonous and mechanical performances of the 
Anglican clergy He had a strong feeling for all that was beautiful 
and impressive in art, and he wanted, as Muller perfectly under- 
stood, to see the service of God in church to be full of both reverence 
and beauty 

Max Muller also felt that Newmamsm was a natural trend in the 
English Church, and he expressed the opinion to Bunsen that he 
was convinced that a regeneration of the English Church could only 
come from the High Church party Even though inclining to 
Romanism, Muller felt that Newmamsm could bring the English 
Church to a state of ferment out of which it was likely to emerge 
purified and reformed What he saw of the practices and spirit of 
the official Anglican Church at Oxford was bound to confirm him in 
this view It was lifeless 

But the ecclesiastical establishment, inert and somnolent as it was 
m many matters, could be extremely awake in detecting heresy and 
equally active in suppressing it One of Muller’s early and intimate 
friends at Oxford suffered from this He was James Anthony Froude, 
the future historian, and at that time a fellow of Exeter College He 
published his Nemesis of Faith, early in 1849, an d at once there was a 
doctrinal stoim The scandal was such that Froude had to give up 
his fellowship, and lose his only means of livelihood This was not, 
however, the worst of his punishments His father, a well-to-do and 
well-known archdeacon, was so displeased that he stopped the 
allowance he was making to his son. Even when he secured the 
headmastership of a college in distant Tasmania, his enemies got 
the appointment cancelled Froude, who was engaged to be married, 
was in great distress, and had to sell his books one by one At that 
time a cheque from an undisclosed source came to Max Muller to 
be handed to him Many years later Froude discovered the name of 
the donor, and returned the money which had saved him from in- 
solvency. 

Muller tiled to help his friend by bringing him in contact with

Bunsen, who at once invited him to his house Muller thought that 
it would be sad if a man of Fronde’s talents was to fall into the hands 
of the English Radicals, Chartists and Unitarians, and he thought if 
Bunsen could send him to Germany in some capacity he could per- 
haps serve religion better in his own country by transforming the 
results of German theological and historical investigations into a 
native product But this came to nothing, and Fioude had to leave 
Oxford Before he did so even his friends and acquaintances avoided 
him Many times, when walking in the streets with Muller, he 
would pass a former friend who took no notice of him, and say 
‘That is another cut 5 

Another discovery, of quite the opposite kind, pained Muller 
no less He found that men who were considered quite orthodox 
were really without any belief They spoke freely to him because they 
imagined that as a German he would share their scepticism He saw 
that it was not simply honest doubt which was disturbing them 
They had passed through that phase of disbelief, and had settled 
down to a Voltairian levity which scoffed at everything connected 
with religion This was something which he never expected to find at 
Oxford In writing of the prevalence of this kind of irreligiosity, 
Max Muller naturally did not mention names, but he thought it 
necessary to mention the fact as a part of the mosaic of religious 
thought and feeling which existed at Oxford when he went there 

While observing Oxford life as well as participating in it, Max 
Muller was, of course, carrying on his own highly specialized work 
of editing the Rig-Veda It called for immense labour, but by the 
end of 1849 h e ^ a< i seen t ^ ie ^ rst volume through the pi ess He had 
the German capacity foi working on any project in hand without 
allowing his social life and recreations, his moods, or even his 
anxiety in respect of worldly prospects, to divert him from it 
Nevertheless, he had his worries 

He was only a sojourner at Oxford, and had no connexion with 
the university He did not know whether Oxford would have any 
permanent career to offer him, and he did not try to find any as yet. 
He did not know how long he would remain there, and had a vague 
notion that the stay would last until the whole of the Rtg»Veda was 
published, which might take years In fact, beyond the assurance 
that he was provided with an income which would enable him to 
live modestly as long as this commission continued and which would 
give him some freedom not to jump at any employment that might

come in his way, everything about his future was undecided and 
unknown However, within a month of coming to Oxford he dis- 
covered that T must find some further occupation here, for San- 
skrit alone does not yield enough to live on 5 As he extended his 
social life, he made the further discovery that to live in Oxford 
society was expensive The question of a permanent career had to 
be considered, if not decided 

All this, together with a clash in his mind between his natural 
love for Germany and the growing liking for England, made him 
oscillate between the two countries when considering his future 
At Oxford he was only a resident alien As he wrote to his mother 
‘Life is on the whole very pleasant, and yet one feels as if one hardly 
belonged to it , people are too polite for one to feel quite at ease 9 He 
thought that if he could live at one of the universities on the Rhine, 
at Bonn or Heidelberg, one might enjoy life more He hoped that 
would come some day so that he would be able to drink a good glass 
of Rhine wine with his family and friends At the same time he also 
knew perfectly well that though his life in a foreign country often 
seemed tedious and made him wish to go back to his own country 
and people, ‘one must woik to live, and work where one finds work 5 
So he wrote to his mother on October 3, 1848 ‘If I go to Germany 
next year, I must look about and see what can be done there, and if 
any prospects open for me , if not I must look out for some career 
that later on would settle me here 9 

What made him yearn to go back to Germany in 1848 and 1849 
was the turmoil produced by the revolutions of that period ‘It 
sometimes seems to me wrong’, he wrote, ‘to be sitting and working 
here so peacefully in Oxford, whilst so many in Germany are torn 
away from their scientific employments and must share all the 
dangers of war ’ He was still more perturbed the next year when he 
learned about the distuibances at Dresden, and he wrote to his 
mother. ‘If this goes on in Germany, I cannot leave you there with- 
out protection, and I am really thinking of giving up my work here, 
and going to you In times like this all other considerations must 
give way, and many plans be given up 9 

But this compulsion did not actually face him So what he had to 
consider during these years was whether going to Germany would 
result in any good, given the kind of life he had chosen and the type 
of character that was his He put his case to his mother quite clear- 
sightedly 



106 SCHOLAR EXTRAORDINARY 

The revolutions in Germany have laid such hold on all circumstances 
of life, and have so undermined the foundations of society, that one 
loses all courage to build one’s future on such a soil, unless one feels 
the strength and power to take an active part in initiating and settling 
matters On the contrary, if one wishes to find one’s ideal of life in the 
narrow quiet circle of science, one has the right, I think, to seek shelter 
there where science, if not patronized and aided, is at least tolerated 
and left alone 

He felt that, as he was, he would in Germany only be drawn into 
party conflicts without the power to effect any good So he con- 
sidered whether he would not do well to settle down in England 
entirely, and thought he might be quite at home and happy there 
He put his state of mind even more positively ‘With all my love 
of the past, and with full belief in the future of Germany, I feel 
more drawn at present to English than to German soil 9 But his 
ambivalence between the two countries was to continue for 
years 

The question was decided practically for him by external circum- 
stances. He also found that he did not have full freedom to decide 
by himself In the middle of 1849, when the first volume of his 
edition of the Rtg-Veda was nearing completion, he thought that 
after it was published he would go back to Germany, take up any 
post he could find there, and continue editing and printing the 
work from there He thought that would offer no practical difficulty, 
nor delay the final publication So he put the idea to Professor 
Horace Hayman Wilson, who was supervising his work on behalf 
of the East India Company At once there was an explosion Wilson, 
a very self-willed and even irascible man, told him that he would 
never hear of it, and added sarcastically ‘It is no use talking about 
Vaterland and Hetmweh Why, all young men who go to India never 
see their fathers and mothers again My father and mother died 
before I came back That cannot be helped But that is your look- 
out You will never go to Germany with my permission * 

The next day Wilson relented a little, and Max Muller felt en- 
couraged to toy with the idea of being able to edit the Rig-Veda from 
Germany He was curiously unsettled in mind Two weeks after the 
conversation with Wilson he informed his mother that, since he 
could not hope for a speedy settling down of Germany, he was going 
to look for a settled position in England But in six weeks he wrote 
to her again that as he was to go on a holiday in Germany at the end 



EARLY YEARS AT OXFORD 107 

of the year, when the first volume of the Rig-Veda would be pub- 
lished, and spend the winter with her, he would try to find a place 
in a German university, preferably Bonn, and see if it would be 
possible to come over to England for a short period every year to 
look after the printing of the Rig-Veda The truth was that his 
judgement told him that he was likely to remain in England for 
many years, while his emotional preference was still for his own 
country He put that quite clearly to his mother ‘The longer one 
lives in England, the more one longs to be back in Germany A 
stormy sea is better than a dead sea! The English grow more like 
the Chinese with each year, and nature herself has built a Chinese 
wall round their lovely country But if one can make oneself into a 
Chinaman, one gets on well with them ’ 

But as the long holiday in Germany was months away, and Max 
Muller was ill and needed rest, his friend Moner carried him off 
to the Lake District to join one of Jowett’s reading parties and 
also to meet Froude who was staying there He felt well as soon as 
he got there, and was enchanted by the beauty of the mountains 
and lakes He paid unstinted tribute to it in a letter to his mother. 
‘The beauty of England,’ he said, ‘is so great that one cannot under- 
stand why the English always go to the Continent in search of 
beautiful scenery ’ 

At the end of October he went to Berlin He paid visits to Dresden 
and Leipzig, and then returned to Berlin bringing his mother with 
him But by January he was tired of his idleness and longing to be 
back at Oxford He had already met his old friend, Alexander von 
Humboldt, and shortly before he was to leave, went to see him 
again Humboldt told him that King Frederick William IV had 
expressed a wish to see him before he left Berlin, and brought him 
an invitation to dinner. Muller had seen the King once and pre- 
sented a copy of the first volume of the Rig-Veda to him in a private 
audience The King told him that he knew all about it, and had so 
much to say himself about the book that Muller hardly got any 
chance to give his own account of it 

But a strange thing happened on the morning of the dinner. 
Muller was sitting in his lodgings with his mother, when a young 
lieutenant of police entered and began an interrogation— why he 
had come to Berlin, what was keeping him there, and when he was 
to leave Muller explained that he had come to collate manuscripts 
m the Royal Library, but the officer informed him that the police 



108 SCHOLAR EXTRAORDINARY 

authorities wanted him to leave within twenty-four hours At that 
Muller told him quietly ‘Of course, I shall obey orders and leave 
at once, but I must request the police authorities to inform His 
Majesty the King that I shall not be able to dme with him tonight 5 
When the officer saw that Muller was in earnest he looked thunder- 
struck and left with a bow Soon after a senior official arrived at 
Muller’s house to apologize 

In the afternoon Humboldt came to take him to Charlottenburg, 
and when told of the incident was extremely amused Afterwards 
Muller found out the reason for his order of expulsion In Berlin he 
had been seeing a fellow Sanskrit scholar, Goldstucker, almost 
every day, and Goldstucker had been mixed up with political acti- 
vities, was kept under surveillance, and was even looked upon as a 
dangerous revolutionary Max Muller was taken as an emissary to 
him from England, then considered to be the focus of all political 
conspiracies 

Max Muller had arranged to leave immediately after this dinner, 
but his friend Morier, who was in Beilm, fell ill and he was obliged 
to stay on and nurse him In the meanwhile, his long absence from 
Oxford and his work had angered Wilson, and on February 26 he 
wrote a peremptory letter to Max Muller saying that unless the 
work proceeded faster he himself would not live to see it finished 
‘But seriously, 5 Wilson added, ‘I wish you would soon resume your 
labours It is high time to put a stop to all the wild fancies that a 
partial knowledge of the light and reliance upon such equivocal 
guides as the Brahmanas and Sutras seem likely to engender I want 
you also to help in the distribution of copies 5 So Muller had to 
return at once, and for the next few months he devoted himself to 
the Veda y and even spent the long vacation at Oxford, though he 
wrote to Palgrave to say that it was more like purgatory than any- 
thing else ‘Yet here I am,’ he added, ‘and I cannot get away on 
account of one miserable ms, which I must go and look at every day 
while I am carrying my Rig~Veda through the pi ess 5 

From this it could be anticipated that Muller would again be 
seized with a fit of weariness with England and his life there, and 
so he was At the end of the year he thought he would write to 
Lassen, the great Sanskntist at Bonn, and in his desperation even 
contemplated that if nothing came out of Germany he would try 
India He wrote to Bunsen, and spoke to Wilson about his inten- 
tions Bunsen was frightened, and informed him that it was the very 



EARLY YEARS AT OXFORD 109 

worst time to go to Bonn Wilson advised him to remain in England 
or go to India 

Besides his love for and loyalty to Germany, it was the dichotomy 
m his character, divided between will and judgement on the one 
hand and passion and impulse on the other, which was causing him 
to waver in this fashion But the immediate reason was the uncertainty 
of his prospects and the strain of living from hand to mouth Even in 
his desperation Muller could summon philosophy to his aid Tf 
Lassen makes difficulties,’ he wrote , 4 1 must decide to stay in England, 
till a kindly fate leads me out of the Oxford hermit’s cell, into free 
German air, or into a forest solitude in India ’ 

The fates decided for Oxford At the end of the year (1850) there 
came an offer from the Taylorian Institution to lecture there on 
modern European languages The Institution was an adjunct of the 
university, and it was governed by a body of curators It was also 
housed in a building which in its style did not conform to Oxford 
architecture, in fact, it was the hist Palladian building to be erected 
there with statues on its top It is now the eastern wing of the 
Ashmolean, with its fagade on St Giles. In 1848 the Institution had 
founded a professorship of modern European languages, to provide 
lectures from the point of view of comparative philology, and it 
appointed as its first holder a half-Russian, half-Swiss Orientalist 
and linguist, named Trithen, who was a friend of Muller But soon 
after his appointment he began to go out of his mind, and could not 
deliver all the lectures So Muller was asked if he would lecture in 
Trithen’s absence on a part of his annual salary of .£400 At first 
he hesitated, but afterwards accepted at Bunsen’s insistence He 
began his lectures from the Lent Term of 1851, and the subject of 
the first course was ‘The History of Modern Languages’ The pros- 
pect of succeeding to the professorship also weighed with Muller, 
and as Trithen was found to be hopelessly ill and had to go into an 
asylum, Muller was appointed Deputy Professor 

In the courses of lectures which he delivered for three years in 
this post, Muller developed the ideas he was to set down more 
fully and formally as a pioneer in linguistics But his unsettled mood 
continued, and he still longed to go back to Germany Tf any sort 
of favourable prospect offered,’ he wrote to his mother, T would 
willingly exchange my pleasant life in Oxford for a simple German 
manage,’ Again he wrote T am nowhere so happy as in Dessau You 
will laugh at this, but had you been living for six or seven years 



110 SCHOLAR EXTRAORDINARY 

among strangers you would understand how delightful it is to see 
well-known faces and well-known streets and houses round one If I 
had independent means, I would live in Dessau, and by choice in 
my grandfather’s house with the garden, where I know every tree * 
The high grim busts of the Caesars on the railing of the Sheldo- 
man must have smiled sardonically, for Oxford was soon to claim 
him permanently And when in late life he went to his birthplace 
he did not meet one man or woman whose face or name he knew, 
and he had to go to the old cemetery outside the town to be greeted 
by old names, some very dear to him and others forgotten in his 
zvanderjahre However, he went for a holiday to Germany in the 
summer of 1852, and travelled as far afield as the Tyrol But he 
returned to Oxford 

In 1853 Trithen died, and the Taylonan Professorship fell 
vacant Max Muller immediately applied for it He ran every chance 
of getting it, but the curators took a long time to decide, and again 
his temperament made him worry unduly He wrote to Bunsen 

It is a hard trial of one’s patience I really don’t know what to do, 
and whether it is not best to return to Germany and finish up and pub- 
lish what I have already done on the Rig- Veda My friends advise 
me to stay on here, and they assure me Convocation would veto the 
election of anyone else, if the Curators attempted it For myself, I am 
almost indifferent I shall have another year of uncertainty, of which I 
have had enough in the past three years However such is the world, 
says John Bull, and tries to console himself I am doing my best to 
follow his good advice 

Bunsen gave him even more energetic admonition Tt is a great 
trial of patience, but be patient, that is, wise One must never allow 
the toilsome labour of years, of quiet reflexion, and of utmost exer- 
tion for the attainment of one’s aim to be destroyed by an unpro- 
pitious event ’ Max Muller obeyed 

But it did take nearly a year before, at the beginning of February 
1854, the Professorship was at last decided in his favour. He wrote 
joyfully to his friend Palgrave. 

I cannot tell you how happy I feel, after the long suspense, to have at 
last a 7cou oto 5 for the rest of this life, and to be able to look on quietly 
till the moving panorama comes to an end I feel now more than ever 
that it is owing to the kindness of those who first received me at Oxford 



EARLY YEARS AT OXFORD 


111 


that I owe my further success and present position Ce n’est que le 
premier pas qui coute , and after I was once in the right boat I was sure 
to get into harbour sooner or later 

A month later he gave the news to his mother After saying that 
he was tired of the endless parties that were being given him, he 
wrote ‘You can imagine I was not a little pleased when everything 
was definitely settled But when one waits so long for a thing it does 
not give one the same pleasure as when it comes unexpectedly But 
I heartily thank God that my future is now entirely secured, as far 
as food and raiment are concerned ’ 

Bunsen’s congratulations were wholehearted He had already told 
Muller that neither he himself nor Muller would ever again be quite 
at home in Germany, and he wrote ‘Your position in life now rests 
on a firm foundation . . and that in this heaven-blest, secure, free 
island, and at a moment when it is hard to say whether the thrones 
of princes or the freedom of nations is in greatest danger ’ 

This appointment was not a professorship of the university, nor 
was his membership of Christ Church as an honorary in a since 
December 1851 a formal incorporation in it But for all practical 
purposes he belonged to Oxford and his future was decided, though 
he would still think of going to Germany He was to remain in 
England till his death, and even before the question of his selection 
as Taylorian Piofessor had been decided, another event had taken 
place which made it impossible for him to leave England In Novem- 
ber 1853 he had met English girl who was to be his wife 
With his uncertain prospects he was not thinking of marrying at 
all His mother often urged him, but he considered it would be 
madness to marry Actually, in reply to one of her letters, he had 
written in the middle of 1853 ‘I have not yet any plans of the sort 
I think one has enough trouble in making one’s way through the 
world If such a thing presents itself — well , but I have no wish to 
take much tiouble in looking about ’ However, it did present itself 
On November 26 of the same year he saw an English gill of nine- 
teen, and at the age of thirty fell violently in love at first sight This 
was going to be as great a combined romance and trial in his life as 
his career had been 

James Anthony Froude had married Charlotte Grenfell, while 
Charles Kingsley had marned another sister, Fanny The Grenfells 
were originally from Buckinghamshire, and had settled around 



112 SCHOLAR EXTRAORDINARY 

Taplow and Maidenhead They had their money in banking and 
mining, and interests in sport The brother of Charlotte and Fanny 
was Riversdale Grenfell, whose motherless and beautiful daughter 
Georgina was brought up by her maiden aunt, the eldest Miss 
Grenfell The women of the family seem to have been different 
from the men, with stronger religious, intellectual and passionate 
inclinations Froude had often talked of his clever young German 
friend to his relatives, and Riversdale Grenfell asked him to bring 
Max Muller to his house, Ray Lodge, near Maidenhead, for a 
Saturday to Monday visit He came, and fascinated all present by 
his brilliant, lively conversation and exquisite music Georgina 
Grenfell has described his appearance as it was then ‘He was very 
dark, with regular features, fine bright eyes, and a beautiful coun- 
tenance full of animation, and it was difficult to reconcile his youth- 
ful appearance with his already great reputation ’ 

On Max Muller the impression was decisive Years after he told 
his wife that as soon as he saw her he felt ‘That is my fate * I have 
seen the journal which Georgina Grenfell kept for three years to set 
down her agony of mind at not being allowed by her father to marry 
him I read the following in his own handwriting ‘I loved you from 
the first day I saw you, and wherever you are my soul will always 
cling to yours I never loved any one, till I saw you, and I never 
shall love any one else ’ Underneath were pressed three pansies with 
some leaves, and they still retain some of their colours 

This passionate commitment at first sight is in the line of direct 
descent from Dante, who wrote about his first vision of Beatrice 
‘At that moment, I say most truly that the spirit of life, which hath 
its dwelling in the secretest character of the heart, began to tremble 
so violently that the least pulses of my body shook therewith; and 
in trembling said these words Ecce deus fortior me, qui vemens 
domimbatur mthi [Here is a deity stronger than I, who, loving, shall 
rule over me] ’ 

But Dante’s poetic idealization of love needs a good deal of 
explanation, especially to those who have come to employ the word 
‘Victorian’ as a pejorative. Even less clever people smile at the men- 
tion of love at fiist sight This is natural For one thing, neither love 
nor death seem quite real when they strike down otheis. And, being 
supra-rational, love is never wholly accessible to the intellect This 
makes ordinary minds admit its existence but without understand- 
ing its nature.

EARLY YEARS AT OXFORD 

In an age which is weary and blase it needs a renaissance of 
wonder to understand love As soon as one pauses to think about it, 
love takes on the appearance of a mystery or even a miracle This 
is of course more true of love at first sight It is not created by any 
attraction set going by the mind Far less is it the product of sexual 
desire If Max Muller was transfixed by the very first sight of 
Georgina Grenfell, it could not have been through the rousing of 
such an urge Nor had he any knowledge of her mind What was it in 
her then that had brought this about ? 

The question really cannot be answered If Max Muller recog- 
nized his ‘fate 9 in Georgina, it was the kind of fatalism which makes 
a wireless set tuned to a particular wavelength receive only the 
messages transmitted to it through that wavelength In short, love 
at first sight is ineluctable and beyond reason, and it has nothing to 
do with the mind That also makes it very dangerous Perhaps that 
is why love has been called blind, which is only a crude way of say- 
ing that it is abstract and yet compulsive Max Muller found it to 
be so 

Two days after his visit to Ray Lodge, the Grenfells went to 
Oxford for a meeting of the leading church choirs of the diocese, 
and there he was their constant guide in sightseeing When they 
left they invited him to spend Christmas with them He could not 
go, and gave engagements with Bunsen and his own work as reasons 
But something else had happened in the meanwhile to make him 
shy Muller had not lost time, and had written to Froude about his 
wish to marry Georgina The latter replied on December 19, saying 
that he was not altogether surprised, for he had had a full account of 
what had taken place at Oxford He had to say something, but also 
felt that it was hard indeed to know what to say when the means of 
coming to a right judgement were so small, and a mistake could be 
dangerous* 

He could not hold out any immediate hope for his friend, and felt 
unhappy T am writing like an icicle, 9 he said, 'as if the east wmd 
had got mto my mk and chilled it But what I want you to see is that 
they have not yet had time to form such a judgement upon you as 
would allow them in common prudence to give a favourable answer 
at present 9 As to going to Ray Lodge, his advice was wise Tf you 
feel, 9 he said, 'that you can control yourself I believe I may advise 
you to go as you will to Ray Lodge, if not, I should say certainly do 
not go But I do not know whether I have a right to say “go 99 under

any circumstances, and her happiness may be at stake, I do not 
mean now But if she sees much of you it might become so 5 
The immediate obstacle, as Froude saw it, was insufficient 
acquaintance The girl, he said, hs only nineteen and there would 
be a natural desire that she should not so early in life be allowed to 
come to a hasty decision’ So he advised Max Muller to go on gently, 
to let acquaintance ripen into intimacy He spoke to his wife, and 
she wished that Muller would come and see her Froude strongly 
urged his friend to come, saying ‘It will be worth your while even 
for your dearest purpose, as you will be gaming acquaintance 
among the other members of the family 9 

But the most serious difficulty was money, without a sufficient 
amount of which according to his own ideas Riversdale Grenfell was 
never likely to give his consent to any proposal of marriage foi his 
daughter On this score Froude gave information about his relations 
which showed how much trust he had in his foreign friend Though 
Riversdale Grenfell lived in great comfort and was bringing up his 
daughter almost in luxury, Froude thought he could not leave her 
much money As he explained 

Riversdale married secretly, the match not being approved by his 
family, and therefore there was no marriage settlement no one in 
consequence can tell what his children’s fortunes will be He has been 
extravagant and is not likely to have saved, and my impression is that 
he has insured his life largely, but that in his life he will not be able to 
give very much to them You would not mind this in itself, but you are 
aware that it will make him feel it the more necessary that by an in- 
surance if not by other means a provision of some sort must be made 
by whoever marries Georgma, though on the other hand he would 
probably make her a liberal allowance I speak of these things be- 
cause it will be on them, if anywhere, that the difficulty will arise 

Nothing could be more realistic and frank But Froude saw the 
want of money only as a temporary obstacle, though Max Muller as 
lover was inclined to look on it as the blasting of his hopes for ever 
So he was reminded of his prospects, both near and distant Froude 
said that the Grenfells were fully sensible of the high and distin- 
guished position which he occupied, and in actual fact his prospects 
were as good as any professional person could wish for. He told 
Muller that in January the question of his professorship was to be 
settled, and then the salary might be raised, and the Sanskrit pro- 
fessorship held by FI H Wilson might also become vacant ‘At any

rate/ Fronde observed, ‘the more they see and hear you the more 
good they will sec and hear the more they will be assured that 
even in a worldly point of view you have a clear and prosperous 
future before you, and I do not pietend to say that considerations 
of this kind will not be of weight God bless you, my dear fellow, 
I wish I could say more ’ 

Froude conveyed to his friend some idea of the dramatis per- 
sonae who were to have a voice, direct or indirect, in this matter 
Of his wife, the girl’s aunt, he said that she entirely and heartily 
sympathized with him and wished him success She even proposed 
to speak to her eldest sister pnvately, so that the matter might not 
go any further Froude particularly asked Max Muller to take Miss 
Grenfell into his confidence, and assured him of her sympathy in all 
circumstances, though not of hei consent at this stage Muller, he 
said, could depend upon receiving the wisest and kindest advice 
from her On this point he was insistent He wrote ‘If I were you 
I would implicitly trust Miss Grenfell I would go to Ray Lodge, 
see her, talk to her, and ask her indirectly as you easily may She 
will understand you and you will understand her without any pain- 
ful explicitness You may count on the utmost goodwill from 
everyone ’ 

But it was the father who was going to be the uncertain factor 
Not that he disliked Max Muller On the contrary, even on that 
short acquaintance he had taken a fancy to him One of the Grenfell 
ladies said laughing that if Mr Muller were a lady Riversdale would 
want to marry him himself But Froude pointed out that he was a 
very odd person, and neither his wife nor he could answer for him 
‘Words/ he went on to say, ‘which would bear the best interpreta- 
tion with a man of a more normal land, cannot be interpreted with 
equal certainty in him He likes you exceedingly as a personal 
friend He has taken a fancy to you and will in all probability con- 
tinue and like you better But the likelihood of an affection springing 
up between you and his daughter has probably never occurred to 
him as it would with any other father ’ 

All this advice and other admonitions were addressed to Muller 
by Froude between the end of December 1853 and the beginning of 
February 1854 One thing he specially warned Muller against, and 
that was precipitancy, haste and impulsiveness. But, characteristic- 
ally, Muller could not bear the uncertainty, and he asked his friend 
to broach the question with Miss Grenfell So Froude wrote to her,

and on February 9 he informed his friend T have written I 
shall get an answer on Saturday and you will perhaps therefore on 
Sunday learn all you desire You know my heart is with you God 
bless you, dear fellow, in your future whatever it is to be * Then he 
gave a very curious warning, and that about his brother-in-law 
Charles Kingsley ‘Avoid Kingsley in this matter, Don’t breathe 
it to him ’

RAY LODGE, Feb 10(1854) 

My dear Anthony, 

I do not wish to lose any time in answering your letter — which I do 
with a feeling of great regret at the idea that we may unconsciously 
have occasioned suffering to a person we all feel as much regard for as 
it is possible to do on so short an acquaintance as ours is with Mr 
Muller It certainly had not occurred to any of us to view him in the 
light of anything but a most agreeable and improving friend — and 
surrounded as we are — and as Georgy especially is, with frivolous and 
far inferior men, I have been glad to indulge my own taste for what is 
better and to give her when the opportunity occurred the benefit of 
such good society — I am truly grieved if in so doing we have led Mr 
Muller into any false views or expectations, but, after all, our meetings 
with him have been only three since the time you first brought him 
among us — at Oxford for two days — and one visit here of two hours 
before the last when he remained from Saturday till Monday On all 
these occasions there has only been general conversation and I am 
quite sure he has never had ten minutes’ real intercourse with G 
during the whole time Nothing in his manner has been the least 
marked or peculiar and I am sure she is quite ignorant of his feelings — 
being quite convinced that she likes his society as a most superior, 
agreeable man from whom there is always something to be learned 
and nothing more — I felt that the pleasure we all take in his visits might 
be safely indulged and when he came in on Saturday invited him to 
remain — this you will observe is the first invitation since Christmas — 
and the other in prospect is the London Madrigal Meeting to which my 
brother asked him Perhaps I am dwelling too long on all this, but I am 
anxious to prove that the degree of intercourse there has been could not 
have prepared us for this result 

To turn to the specific part of the subject — you must tell Mr Muller 
what I fear will be painful — that my brother considers G. too young to 
wish to have anything of the kind seriously proposed to her — that 
without an adequate provision for the future as well as the present he 
could not, however high a person’s character might be, listen to any-

thing of the kind — that we know far too little of Mr Muller, however 
that little may be appreciated by us all, to enter on such a question 
with him — and that I have not the least doubt if it was put before G 
herself she would at once desire it might go no further I have not 
mentioned the subject to her, nor shall I do so unless it would be a 
satisfaction to Mr Muller to have my words confirmed by her I think 
it may save awkwardness and discomfort in future if she is not told this 
— and I must add my sincere regret that under the circumstances I 
shall feel it right and wise not to ask him to our home again for his own 
sake and that it will be a loss and privation to us all My brother has an 
especial enjoyment in his society — and so I need not say have I — and I 
fear G ’s pleasure in listening to him and her interest in his conversa- 
tion must have misled him for she has this in common with us all — but 
nothing beyond it 

I shall feel more sorry for all this if I could reproach myself with 
throwing them often together but both his visits lately paid were quite 
unexpected tho’ very welcome — and when here I know they had very 
little intercourse and that only with all the rest of the party — I cannot 
help wishing you had not been quite so discreet, for if I had the least 
idea of Mr in ’$ feelings I should never have exposed him to having 
them strengthened and I wonder he could suppose that I understood 
these when I gave him on his gomg away the last time such a cordial 
invitation to return often It would have been strange to do so if I 
had had anything of the kind in view, supposing that I had quite 
approved of it — I can truly say I have seldom met anyone I liked so 
much and I have no doubt that my manner has — tf he could suppose I 
understood him — helped to encourage his feeling, for it has expressed 
quite what I feel — as much regard and interest as on such a recent 
acquaintance I could feel I think it must be flattering to any young 
person to be preferred by such a Man, but it would be more so if it 
had been the result of a longer and more intimate acquaintance It is 
quite painful to me to have one agreeable — I would say valuable friend- 
ship broken up, and I trust nothing I have said will unnecessarily 
wound him As I shall tell G nothing I cannot help hoping at some 
future time when it is not painful to his feelings our intercourse may 
be renewed I will just add that I was obliged to mention the subject 
m a very hurried way to Riversdale this morning as he was gomg from 
home — but what I have said are his sentiments as well as mine 

I have written a long letter, but found it difficult to say all I wished 
m fewer words Pray let me know what you hear further of Mr Muller 
and give him my kindest regards 

Yours affectionately, 

G. in Grenfell

The letter was long, just short of one thousand words in length 
It would certainly not have been expected from a Victorian old 
maid by anyone who had taken the anti-Victorian fripperies of 
writers like Lytton Strachey seriously 

On February 13 Froude sent the letter to Max Muller and felt 
sure that on reflection Muller would see how reasonable much of 
what she said really was He himself felt that ‘it would have been 
wrong on so slight and brief an acquaintance to have written with 
decided encouragement’ His advice about the future was manly 
and sensible 

You will see [he wrote] that at present the very question will not be 
entertained If in our point of view it seems hard, on the other hand 
you have reason to be grateful for it, for when the question is not enter- 
tained there is no refusal The future is before you to make your way 
Let me entreat you to look at it in this way Take no steps which may 
force them to speak decidedly Above all, do not now think of going 
to Ray Lodge or of asking to be allowed to do so My dear Muller, 
everybody knows what your talents are Show now what your 
character is 

It seems Max Muller was not quite persuaded Therefore Froude 
wrote again on the 15th 

My dear Muller, I cannot see why because you cannot have what you 
wish at first asking for it, you should assume that it is beyond your 
reach for ever I have read in books, I have witnessed in life years 
of warm and loving devotion without hope, almost without desire of 
return, cheerfully and nobly offered It is beautiful to love and to be 
loved It is noble to love for true love's sake what is truly and really 
lovely 

Then he disclosed a secret about Miss Grenfell heiself, ‘Do you 
know,’ he wrote, ‘that Miss Grenfell herself has carried with her out 
of her young years the scars of a disappointment which will go with 
her into her grave ? When we meet people whom we admire how 
little do we guess the school in which they have been training ’ 
Froude could match his knowledge of the world with sensibility 
The Grenfell family, on its part, did not judge Muller harshly 
‘On the contrary,’ Froude assured his friend, ‘she speaks of you 
with the very warmest affection and cannot find words to express the 
sorrow that both she and River sdale feel at the interruption of the 



EARLY YEARS AT OXFORD 119 

intercom be between you I would advise you to smother your 
feelings I tell you to hope gallantly ’ 

But even the intercourse was not to be interrupted In May the 
Grenfells were going again to Oxford, and Miss Grenfell wrote to 
Froude to tell Muller that as Georgina knew nothing of the past 
there was not the slightest unwillingness on their part to meet him, 
on the other hand there was every desire 

This closes the first stage of Max Muller’s courting of Georgina, 
when she knew nothing of what was going on The episode shows 
how superficial, untrue and malicious was the later running-down 
of the Victorians as stodgy, insensitive and snobbish people On the 
contrary, they had not undergone that erosion of the passionate side 
of the human personality which has certainly come about today, 
passion and sensuality not being exchangeable terms Only, the 
great Victorians knew that passion brought in its wake suffering 
just as it also did exultant happiness The suffering they tried to 
bear with stoicism and in silence, a type of behaviour not accessible 
to cleverness But even worldly Victorians could sense the stoicism 
and respect it The Grenfells did not sneer at Muller because with- 
out possessing money he had aspired after their daughter. Their 
worldlmess could go with an appreciation of unworldlmess.

### THE RIG-VEDA
Chapter I 

THE RIG-VEDA 

It took Max Muller five years of continuous labour, which was 
partly mechanical drudgery, to complete the editing and printing of 
only the first volume of his edition of the Rig-Veda To understand 
the spirit and motivation of this project as well as his interest in the 
wider field of Sanskrit literature as a whole, it is necessary to take 
note of a basic contrast , that which existed between the German and 
English attitudes towards India in his young days This is essential 
because in his own position there was an amalgamation of the two 
He began as a purely German Indophile and Indologist, and soon 
assumed the roles in their Bntish form, without however losing 
his original affiliation and inspiration 

Generally speaking India attracted Continental Europeans, 
especially the Germans, and repelled the British This difference 
persisted even down to the last quarter of the nineteenth century 
For instance, when Sir Henry Maine in 1875 delivered the Rede 
Lecture before the University of Cambridge on ‘The Effects of 
Observation of India on Modern European Thought’, he began by 
remarking that in speaking on a subject connected with India he 
would under ordinary circumstances preface what he had to say 
with an apology But the proverbial dullness attributed to Indian 
topics by Englishmen, he continued, did not reflect any particular 
credit on the latter, nor was it felt by the learned classes in any other 
country Then he described the situation on the Continent. 

No one can observe the course of modern thought and enquiry on the 
Continent, and especially Germany, without seeing that India, so far 
from being regarded as the least attractive of subjects, is rather looked 
upon as the most exciting, as the freshest, as the fullest of new prob- 
lems and of the promise of new discoveries The fervour of enthusiasm 
which glows in the lines written by the greatest of German poets when 
the dramatic genius of the Hindoos first became known to him through 
the translation of Sakuntala , seems to have scarcely abated in the 
scholars of our day who follow philological studies and devote themselves 
to the new branches of investigation constantly thrown out by the 
sciences of Comparative Philology and Comparative Mythology No

one can avoid seeing that their view of India affects in some degree 
their view of England, and the community, which is stigmatised more 
systematically on the Continent than it is perhaps aware, as a nation of 
shopkeepers, is thought to have had a halo of romance spread around 
it by its great possession 

Seven years later, in 1882, Max Muller said the same thing, 
again at Cambridge, when delivering a course of lectures on India 
In England, he told his audience, a study of Sanskrit, and of the 
ancient poetry, the philosophy, the laws and the art of India was

looked upon at best as curious, but was considered by most people 
as useless and tedious, if not absurd Then he drew the contrast 

In France, Germany and Italy, even in Denmark, Sweden and Russia, 
there is a vague charm connected with the name of India One of the 
most beautiful poems in the German language is the Weisheit des 
Brahmanen , , the ‘Wisdom of the Brahman 5 , by Ruckert, to my mind 
more rich in thought and more perfect in form than even Goethe's 
West-osthcher Divan A scholar who studies Sanskrit in Germany is 
supposed to be initiated in the deep and dark mysteries of ancient 
wisdom, and a man who has travelled in India, even if he has only dis- 
covered Calcutta, or Bombay, or Madras, is listened to like another 
Marco Polo In England a student of Sanskrit is generally considered 
a bore, and an old Indian Civil Servant, if he begins to describe the 
marvels of Elephanta or the Towers of Silence, runs the risk of pro- 
ducing a count-out 

This was in every way natural, for the German and British in- 
volvements in India were of wholly different kinds The German 
interest was spontaneous, the product of a combined emotional and 
intellectual urge created by the Romantic Movement, whereas the 
British was forced, a by-product of the establishment of British 
political power In other words, the German interest was ideological 
and imaginative, the British practical and objective For the Germans 
the knowledge of India was an ingredient in a process of becoming , 
by the acquisition of which they wanted to make their European 
personality deeper and fuller They felt that India had thoughts and 
feelings which were different as well as complementary to theirs 
The Englishman would not even consider the possibility that any- 
thing from India could enrich his English personality His problem 
was what to do with India, an unwanted, troublesome and largely 
unintelligible possession for which his country was becoming 
politically responsible 

The Romantic Drang nach Osten , with India as its particular goal, 
refurbished the old Graeco-Roman notion of ex Onente lux , which 
tempted even Plotmus to think of going to India, and this urge 
proclaimed its faith quite early and explicitly Friedrich Schlegel 
declared, even before he knew Sanskrit himself, that it was in the 
East that the Europeans must look for the highest Romanticism 
After he had learnt the language — he could not have learnt much — 
he stated his conviction even more emphatically In his famous 



126 SCHOLAR EXTRAORDINARY 

JJber die Sprache und Weisheit der Indier (On the Language and 
Wisdom of the Hindus), which he published in 1808, he issued 
what might be called the manifesto of a new Renaissance for 
Europe from India 

If the study of the Indian language [he wrote] were able to find only a 
few men to pursue it* Thus in Italy and in Germany in the fifteenth 
and sixteenth centuries was seen a sudden outburst of an ardent love 
for Greek and Latin literature within a very short period of time, so 
that through a rediscovered knowledge of antiquity the whole aspect 
of science or to be more exact that of the world came to be changed 
and as it were renovated Not less sweeping, not less general, we ven- 
ture to say, will be the result of Indian studies, if they are undertaken 
with equal ardour and if they are introduced into the classical circle of 
learning in Europe And why should it not be so ? 

Though this fervent expectation from India had come into exis- 
tence without any worthwhile acquaintance with Indian literature 
and history among the German pre-Romantics and Romantics, it 
was actually sustained and developed by the objective and pains- 
taking work in India of a number of English Orientalists who, in 
whatever leisure they could secure from their administrative work, 
tried to collect as much reliable information about the history and 
civilization of their Hindu subjects as they could, men like Sir 
William Jones, Wilkins, Colebrooke, Halhed, to mention only the 
more important figures They were aided and encouraged in this 
work by the policy of Warren Hastings, who believed in and 
patronized Oriental learning both from intellectual curiosity and a 
realization of its importance for the rightful governing of India 
which, according to his own conviction, could be done only in the 
Indian way These scholars founded the Asiatic Society of Bengal 
m 1784, began to publish their work in its journal, Asiatic Re- 
searches , and within ten years a number of important Sanskrit works 
m translation made it possible for men of letters in Europe to form 
some adequate idea of what Sanskrit literature was like. The key 
works and dates of this early phase were as follows Bhagavad-Gita 
by Wilkins in 1785; his Httopadesa in 1787, Sakuntala by Sir 
William Jones in 1789; Gita-Govinda by Jones in 1792. 

None of these men, with the exception of Sir William Jones, had 
enthusiasm in the slightly pejorative connotation of the age, and 
even Jones did not allow his enthusiasm for ancient India to sup-

press his scientific spirit On the other hand Colebrooke, who made 
the most substantial contributions to the extant body of information 
about the Hindu past, was the coolest and the most rigorous of 
them all As a young official in India he at first even resisted the 
enthusiasm of the local Orientalists, considering it facile and super- 
ficial But his accuracy and industry made him the foremost scholar 
among them when he applied himself to Indian subjects 

But their work had a sensational effect in Germany, where the 
Asiatic Researches were read, along with the other books, with an 
almost delirious interest Of all the early books it was Jones’s trans- 
lation of Kalidasa’s Sakuntala which produced the most powerful 
impression He published it from Calcutta under the title of 
Sacontala or The Fatal Ring An Indian Drama , and it went into 
five impressions immediately and made Jones famous all over 
Europe. Herder wrote to one of his friends 

Do you not wish with me that instead of these endless religious books 
of the Vedas , Upavedas , and U pang as , they would give us the more 
useful and more agreeable works of the Indians, and especially their 
best poetry of every kind ? It is here that the mind and character of a 
nation is best brought to life before us, and I gladly admit that I have 
received a truer and more real notion of the manner of thinking among 
the ancient Indians from this one Sakuntala , than from all their 
Upangas and Bagavedams 

Goethe’s apostrophe to Sakuntala is, of course, famous 

Willte Du die Bluthe des fruhnen, die Fruchte des spateren Jahres, 
Willt Du, was reizt und entzuckt, willt Du was sattigt und nahrt, 
Willt Du den Himmel, die Erde mit emem Namen begreifen, 

Nenn ich, Sacontala , Dich, und so ist Alles gesagt 

(Wilt Thou the blossom of spring and the fruits that are later in season, 
Wilt Thou have charms and delights, wilt Thou have strength and 
support, Wilt Thou with one short word encompass the earth and 
heaven, All is said if I name only, Sacontala , Thee.) 

Goethe wrote this when he was getting tired of the intellectual 
Charlotte von Stem and finding a different kind of happiness in the 
arms of his bettschatz (treasure of the bed), Christiane Vulprns, 
whom the proud Weimar ladies called his Tatter Half’ Perhaps he 
saw in the unsophisticated hermitage girl that Sakuntala was, an 
etherealized Christiane

Goethe's admiration of Sakuntala is however just symbolic, and 
it is referred to only because of his great name He was not in the 
mam stream of Orientalism in Germany, literary or speculative 
He was not interested either in Hindu religion or in Hindu philo- 
sophy, and felt a kinship solely with such Sanskrit poetry as he 
could read in translation Hindu art repelled him, the worshipper 
of the Apollo Belvedere, and he wrote ‘The tiresome trunks of 
elephants, the coiling nests of crawling snakes, the age-old tortoise 
m its cosmic swamp, those kingly heads on a single trunk — such 
things will turn us mad 5 And he cried T should like to live in India, 
if only there had been no stone-masons there 9 

The typical impact of ancient Hindu India on the German mmd 
was seen in the true Romantics who came later — the two Schlegels, 
Novahs, Tieck, Jean-Paul Richter, Ruckert and the like, and among 
philosophers in Schopenhauer above all, but in Hegel and Schellmg 
too The first contacts with the authentic literature from India 
produced the most uncritically enthusiastic notions about the signi- 
ficance of Hindu civilization Sanskrit was represented as the 
mother of all languages The beginnings of all language, of all 
thought and of all religion were traced back to India F Schlegel 
even thought that the architectural monuments of Hindu India were 
as old as the Egyptian * 

Bearing this attitude in mmd, in 1840 H H Wilson, the leading 
English Sanskritist of his time, who distrusted the German school of 
Sanskrit, wrote in the preface to his translation of the Vishnu 
Purana 

It is the boast of inductive philosophy that it draws its conclusions 
from the careful observation and accumulation of facts, and it is 
equally the busmess of all philosophical research to determine facts 
before it ventures upon speculation This procedure has not been 
observed in the investigation of the mythology and traditions of the 
Hindus Impatience to generalize has availed itself greedily of what- 
ever promised to afford materials for generalization, and the most 
erroneous views have been confidently advocated, because the guides 
to which their authors trusted were ignorant or insufficient 

In the first thirty years of the mneteenth century, following some 
twenty of the eighteenth, as A W Schlegel said, Europe had 
acquired more knowledge about India, both ancient and modern, 
than she had obtained in the twenty-one centuries since Alexander

the Great This knowledge was assimilated in Germany in two 
ways First India, or whatever the Germans of that age looked upon 
as India, was absorbed as an element in the German selfhood, 
poetical as well as philosophical, which was expanding under the 
many-sided influence of the Romantic Movement, and in that 
absorption there was no India per se but only India as a colouring 
material of the stuff of German thought and feeling In the second 
approach India was treated as the primary object of investigation 
This activity manifested itself in the growth of a definite German 
school of Sanskrit and of Indology in a number of universities, and 
this school built up through erudition a German image or idea in 
the Platonic sense of India But though not unscientific, that 
image too was very characteristically German— a projection of the 
German Weltanschauung on India It was based wholly on an exege- 
sis of books, and was an intellectual and imaginative but also a very 
selective reconstruction of the Hindu civilization and mind The 
length to which German speculation could go in pursuing its quest 
of India is very forcefully illustrated in Hegel, who wrote in his 
Philosophy of History 

India has always been the land of imaginative inspiration, and appears 
to us still as a fairy region, an enchanted world In contrast with the 
Chmese state which presents only the most prosaic understanding, 
India is the region of phantasy and sensibility It is in the interest of 
spirit that external conditions should become mternal ones, and that 
the natural and the spiritual world should be recognized in the sub- 
jective aspect as belongmg to intelligence, by which process the unity 
of subjectivity and being generally — or the idealism of existence — is 
established This idealism is found in India, but only as an idealism of 
imagination In India the state of absolute being is presented as in 
the ecstatic state of a dreaming condition, and therefore in India was 
to be found, not the dreaming of an actual individual, but the dreaming 
of the absolute spirit* 

The German historical reconstruction of India was not quite this 
castle in the very rarefied air of German philosophy Its feet at least, 
if not the head as well, was in touch with the Indian soil Even so, 
it was also a German structure built on concrete piles driven into 
the very treacherous morass of dependable knowledge about 
ancient India. It created the myth of Indian spirituality, which still 
haunts the world as part of two modern phenomena, the Hindu 



130 SCHOLAR EXTRAORDINARY 

chauvinism of our day, and the spiritual degeneracy of the contem- 
porary West 

Gradually however the absorption of India into the German per- 
sonality stopped, and the foundation of the German Empire in 1870 
is the key event in this eclipse On the other hand, the intellectual 
and scholarly interest too lost its pioneering spirit and its initial 
fervour The urge to discover a new world of thought and feeling 
m India weakened, and Indology became an established academic 
discipline concerned with filling out the gaps and correcting the 
details of the structure already created 
As early as 1859, when Max Muller published his first book on 
ancient Sanskrit literature, he had become conscious of this drift 
towards ossification He remarked that the progress of Sanskrit 
philology was being retarded by an affectation of learned pedantry, 
which had done so much mischief to Greek and Latin scholarship 
and which he had resented in his university days. He admitted that 
the specialist in Sanskrit had much to learn from the methods of a 
Bentley or a Hermann, but he also observed* 

But in Greek and Latin scholarship the distinction between useful and 
useless knowledge has almost disappeared, and the real objects of the 
study of these ancient languages have been wellnigh forgotten More 
than half of the publications of classical scholars have tended only to 
impede our access to the master- works of the ancients , and a sanction 
has been given to a kind of learning, which, however creditable to the 
individual, is of no benefit to the public at large A similar spirit has 
infected Sanskrit philology Sanskrit texts have been edited, on which 
no rational man ought to waste his time Essays have been written on 
subjects on which it is folly to be wise 

In England, too, the great exploratory and garnering adventure 
of the early English Orientalists finally became a specialized aca- 
demic discipline But before they converged on that ground, the 
British and German learning of Sanskrit and ancient Hindu India 
ran along different, though parallel, courses The very first dif- 
ference was that even to the end of the nineteenth century the 
British learning never wholly lost its utilitarian object of being an 
aid and instrument in governing India But this help was sought by 
the British political authorities in the form of information, and never 
as an ideology to shape policies or even outlooks. This attitude in- 
fluenced even those who officially represented Christianity and

Christian morals in India, namely, the ecclesiastical establishment 
of the Government of India With a few distinguished exceptions 
the regular clergy in India left the cultivation of Sanskrit and the 
languages derived from it to the missionaries This, H H Wilson 
wrote in 1830, had had the harmful consequence of depriving the 
Christian presence in India of the means of exercising its proper 
religious and moral influence on Indians As he put it. 

They have been unable to communicate freely with the Hindus, and 
have consequently failed to exercise that influence over them which it is 
likely they might enjoy to a much greater extent than the Missionaries 
In Bengal the better order of Hindus regard the Missionaries with feel- 
ings of inveterate animosity, whilst they invariably express a high re- 
spect for the clergymen of the Established Church They cannot avoid 
seeing that the latter are held in higher estimation by the European 
society, and that they cannot be reproached with practices which not 
infrequently degrade the Missionary character in the eyes of the 
Natives Did the regular clergy add to their personal respectability a 
reputation for scholarship in Indian literature, particularly the litera- 
ture which the Hindus themselves consider as classical and sacred, 
consequences of the most important and beneficial nature might be 
confidently predicted 

This of course did not happen, and could hardly be expected to 
happen, on account of the very narrow and severely practical view 
of the place of Sanskrit learning held by the British authorities 
The second important difference between the British and Ger- 
man schools of Sanskrit learning was that the British throughout 
remained in touch with the indigenous tradition of Sanskrit learning 
continued by the pandits in their time, which the Germans depre- 
cated when they did not wholly reject it as obsolete or dead If this 
prevented the British Orientalists from building castles in the air, 
it also made them infuse some of the decadence, artificiality and 
fossilization present in the survival of Hindu culture among the 
pandits into their conception of Hindu civilization. They could not 
reconstruct an ancient India which was independent of the India 
of their age In other words, their account of ancient India never 
became so genuinely historical as was the reconstruction in the nine- 
teenth century of classical antiquity by European historians of 
Greece and Rome 

The third difference between Germany and Britain in respect of 



132 SCHOLAR EXTRAORDINARY 

Hindu civilization was that the English people did not accept it as 
an element in their mental formation and their cultural activity 
This result could never be expected from them when they were not 
ready to accept the Hindu heritage even for governing India There 
were a number of basic reasons for this rejection, the most important 
being their first-hand knowledge of living Hindus and of their ways 
The British in India found them to be so crude and ignorant and 
even degenerate that they could hardly believe that they had been 
highly civilized at any time Secondly, the positive and active ideo- 
logy for the government of India, which developed after Warren 
Hastings and which admitted any possibility of progress on the 
part of the Indian people, was based on three schools of English 
political thinking Utilitarianism, Evangelism and Whig Libera- 
lism All these were hostile to the beliefs and customs of the Hindus 
which they regarded as stagnant and obscurantist Lastly, the idea 
of ancient India which the British Orientalists were putting for- 
ward appeared to all progressive Englishmen as archaistic and retro- 
gressive So all those who represented the progressive or liberal side 
of British rule in India discounted the value, and partly even the 
existence, of the Hindu civilization 
No one was more forthright in holding and expressing such a 
view than James Mill, the Utilitarian, who held an influential posi- 
tion in India House in London In his History of British India , 
which was published in 1817 and immediately became a classic, he 
attacked the idea that the Hindus were in any sense highly civilized 
at any period The whole of his second book is a coldly contemp- 
tuous dismissal and denunciation of the Hindus as creators and 
products of a high culture In later editions of the book H H 
Wilson tried to correct Mill’s bias in running footnotes disputing 
all his generalizations Even so Max Muller thought that the book 
was responsible for some of the greatest misfortunes that had hap- 
pened to India Every aspect of Hindu life and culture was taken 
up by Mill and described from a standpoint opposite to that of the 
Orientalists, and the garment made by them was turned inside out. 
It was in demolishing their idea of Sanskrit literature that Mill was 
most ruthless Among peoples who were just entering a civilized 
state, Mill said, all literary expression was in verse The literature 
of the Hindus had always remained in this first state 
Mill more specifically made both the book which established the 
idea of a great literature in Sanskrit, and the man who was respon-

sible for presenting it to Europe, the objects of his criticism Of 
Sacontala he said that though it had some pretty passages, as a 
whole it was not a 'story which was above the powers of imagination 
m an uncultivated age’ and there was nothing in it ‘which either 
accorded with the understanding or could gratify the fancy of an 
instructed people 5 Of Sir William Jones he spoke with regret and 
even some disapproval ‘It was unfortunate that a mind so pure, so 
warm in the pursuit of truth, and so devoted to oriental learmng, 
as that of Sir William Jones, should have adopted the hypothesis of a 
high state of civilization in the principal countries of Asia 5 

Nevertheless Mill succeeded in spreading a view which became 
influential and determined policy In Macaulay his disparagement 
of Sanskrit literature became a cool appraisal, and the basis for the 
support given to English as the medium of education in India In 
his famous minute on education in India written on February 2, 
1835, he wrote about Sanskrit literature 

I have no knowledge of either Sanscrit or Arabic But I have done 
what I could to form a correct estimate of their value I have read 
translations of the most celebrated Arabic and Sanscrit works I have 
conversed both here and at home with men distinguished by their pro- 
ficiency in the Eastern tongues I am quite ready to take the Oriental 
learning at the valuation of the Orientalists themselves I have never 
found one among them who could deny that a single shelf of a good 
European library was worth the whole native literature of India and 
Arabia The intrinsic superiority of Western literature is, indeed, fully 
admitted by those members of the Committee who support the 
Oriental plan of education It is, I believe, no exaggeration to say 
that all the historical information which has been collected from all the 
books written in the Sanscrit language is less valuable than what may 
be found in the most paltry abridgements used at preparatory schools 
in England In every branch of physical or moral philosophy the rela- 
tive position of the two nations is nearly the same 

The disparaging thesis, promulgated by two men who were 
regarded as the greatest authorities on India of their age, persisted 
and was not wholly discredited even in the twentieth century In 
1917 William Archer, the dramatic critic, published a book entitled 
India and the Future , in which he denied that India was civilized in 
the accepted European sense. I myself remember the scandal it 
raised, and its refutation came, among others from Aravmda Ghosh, 
more famous under the name of Shri Aurobindo. 



134 SCHOLAR EXTRAORDINARY 

Of course, in spite of the detractors, the English Orientalists 
carried on their researches as scholars and their propaganda as 
apologists But their discoveries and views as well as their defence 
built up only a counter-thesis for those who were seriously interested 
m ancient India As for the educated British public, at their most 
understanding and sympathetic they recognized ancient Indian 
culture as a civilization in being at one time, but which was also for 
them a thing apart The majority were indifferent, except when 
they looked at things Indian as curiosities Outside a circle of more 
or less charlatanesque dabblers and pedlars of Indian spirituality, 
there was no disposition to assign any universal human value to the 
religion, philosophy, literature and art of the Hindus 

Max Muller avoided both extremes, the callow German en- 
thusiasm and the hardboiled English contempt He adopted and 
retained in his attitude to India the strongest and the most sympa- 
thetic features of the interest in that country of both Englishmen 
and Germans He never shed the enthusiasm he had imbibed from 
the Romantic Movement, nor the pioneering spirit of the early days 
of Sanskritic studies Driven by the ideological motivation of the 
German Indophiles, he continued to seek the origins of religion and 
thought through a study of ancient Indian literature He also believed 
that it had a value for all men and for all time But he derived from 
the English Orientalists his conviction of the practical importance 
of Sanskrit for British administrators as well as for contemporary 
Hindus He thought and said that British rule would be more 
understanding and sympathetic, and therefore more productive of 
good for the Indian people if the ruling order became familiar with 
their culture On the other hand, he expected a regeneration of the 
life of the Hindus by bringing their own cultural heritage to their 
knowledge Lastly, he showed the most humane side of the English 
scholarly interest in India by becoming not only an apologist but a 
very vigorous champion of Hindu culture, and telling Englishmen 
how much they had to learn from India By combining all these 
positions in his function of Indologist, he maintained the primacy 
of England in Sanskritic studies in the Western world / 

He proclaimed the larger purpose of Sanskrit philology quite 
emphatically in the introduction to the first book he wrote on San- 
skrit literature A History of Ancient Sanskrit Literature , published 
in 1859 He wrote. 



THE RIG- VEDA 


135 


The object and aim of philology, in its highest sense, is but one, to 
learn what man is, by learning what man has been With this principle 
for our pole-star, we shall never lose ourselves, though engaged in the 
most minute and abstruse inquiries Our own studies may seemingly 
refer to matters that are but secondary and preparatory, to the clear- 
ance, so to say, of the rubbish which passing ages have left on the 
monuments of the human mind But we shall never mistake that rub- 
bish for the monuments which it covers If, then, it is the aim of 
Sanskrit philology to supply one of the earliest and most important 
links in the history of mankind, we must go to work historically, that 
is we must begin, as far as we can, with the beginning, and then trace 
gradually the growth of the Indian mind, in its various manifestations, 
as far as the remaining monuments allow us to follow this course 

The primary object of Muller’s Sanskrit studies was thus neither 
philology nor literature as such, but the evolution of religious and 
philosophical thought Indeed, to his history of ancient Sanskrit 
literature he added the qualification ‘so far as it illustrates the 
primitive religion of the Brahmans’ Therefore he was bound to 
specialize in Vedic literature Mentioning the fact that all later San- 
skrit books on religion, law and philosophy refer back to one early 
and unique authority called by the comprehensive name of the Veda, 
he wrote 

It is with the Veda, therefore, that Indian philosophy ought to begin 
if it is to follow a natural and historical course So great an influence 
has the Vedic age (the historical period to which we are justified in 
referring the formation of the sacred texts) exercised upon all suc- 
ceeding periods of Indian history, so closely in every branch of litera- 
ture connected with Vedic traditions, so deeply have the religious and 
moral ideas of that primitive era taken root in the mind of the Indian 
nation, so minutely has almost every private and public act of Indian 
life been regulated by old traditionary precepts, that it is impossible 
to find the right point of view for judging of Indian religion, morals, 
and literature without a knowledge of the literary remains of the 
Vedic age 

But in actual fact, Muller’s study of Sanskrit literature did not 
begin at its starting point, and in the circumstances it could not 
The early European Orientalists could not begin the study of San- 
skrit and Sanskrit literature with the earliest books in the language. 
As Max Muller pointed out, the Hellenists began where they ought 



136 SCHOLAR EXTRAORDINARY 

to begin, namely, with Homer, Herodotus and Thucydides, and not 
with Anacreontic poetry or Neo-Platomst philosophy But the 
Orientalists concerned with ancient India had to begin with later 
books, like the code of Manu , the Gita , the Hitopadesa , Sakuntala 
and such works in classical Sanskrit At that stage of Sanskntic 
studies no authentic text of the Vedas was available, nor was Yedic 
Sanskrit known 

So Max Muller also began with classical Sanskrit literature, and 
he also shared the current admiration for it His first work in San- 
skrit scholarship was a translation of the Hitopadesa But from the 
beginning his mam interest was in ideas, and therefore he had been 
drawn towards the ZJpanishads> though he had also read a little of 
the Rig -Veda 

In later life, in a letter to Gladstone (January 18, 1883), Max 
Muller described this backward progression of Sanskntic research 
from classical Sanskrit literature to early Vedic literature, and also 
explained its significance In presenting Gladstone with a copy of 
his lectures on India delivered at Cambridge in 1882 he tried to 
interest the great statesman, and he wrote 

I must confess I have long wished for an opportunity of engaging your 
interest in behalf of India , I do not mean the mere surface India, with 
its grotesque religion, its pretty poetry, and its fabulous antiquity, but 
the real India that is only slowly emerging before our eyes, a whole, 
almost forgotten act in the great drama of humanity, very different 
from Greece, from Rome, from modern Europe, and yet not so 
different that in studying it we cannot feel that mutato nomine de nobis 
fabula narratur The discovery of that real India, of that new intellec- 
tual hemisphere, is to my mind a far greater discovery than that of 
Vasco da Gama’s 

Then he described the manner in which this India of his was 
recovered and studied 

It was a misfortune [he observed] that all early publications of Sanskrit 
texts belonged really to the Renaissance of Sanskrit literature Kali- 
dasa’s plays, which were supposed to be contemporaneous with Virgil, 
belong to the sixth century, the Laws of Manu, which Sir William 
Jones placed 1280 b c , cannot be older than 300 a d But there was an 
older literature in India, the Vedic and the Buddhistic, which are only 
now being slowly disinterred, and it is here that we can watch a real 
growth from the simplest beginnings to the highest concepts which the 



THE RIG- VEDA 137 

human mind is capable of, it is there that we can learn what man is, 

by seeing once more what man has been 

As an old admirer of Gladstone, Max Muller hoped that he would 
look at the work the Sanskrit scholars had been doing recently, but 
he was also realistic enough to see that the fulfilment of his desire 
was not to be expected However, the letter very clearly explained 
the beginning of Vedic studies 

As has been mentioned in a previous chapter, it was after going 
to Pans and meeting Burnouf that, following the old scholar’s 
advice, Muller decided to make the Rig-Veda the mam subject of 
his researches When he saw Burnouf the latter told him ‘We 
know what is in the Upanishads , but we want the hymns and their 
native comments.’ 

Burnouf made his advice even more explicit ‘Either one thing 
or the other Either study Indian philosophy and begin with the 
Upanishads and Sankara’s commentary, or study Indian religion 
and keep to the Rig-Veda , and copy the hymns and Sayana’s com- 
mentary, and then you will be our great benefactor ’ He insisted 
more particularly on publishing the commentary on the Rig-Veda 
by Sayanacharya, which dates from the fourteenth century ‘Don’t 
publish the extracts from the commentary only,’ he added ‘If you 
do, you will publish what is easy to read, and leave out what is diffi- 
cult ’ Max Muller thought that it would be very difficult to find a 
publisher for so large a work, but when he confided his fear, said 
‘The Commentary must be published, depend on it, and it will be ’ 
So Max Muller was launched on the project which kept him en- 
gaged for thirty years 

At this time the study of the Vedic literature was in a very rudi- 
mentary state The legend of the Veda as the ‘AryanBible’ had been 
created long before the true text of the Rig-Veda was known The 
earliest authentic account of Vedic literature was given by Cole- 
brooke in his paper ‘On the Vedas or Sacred Writings of the 
Hindus’, published in the Asiatic Researches , vol VIII, printed in 
Calcutta in 1805, and for decades this essay remained the basis of all 
serious and scholarly discussion on the subject The only printed 
text available was that of the first book of the Rig-Veda , edited with 
a Latm translation and incomplete notes (also in Latin) by Rosen, 
and published in 1838 in London by the Oriental Translation Fund 
of Great Britain and Ireland. It was by basing himself on this text

supplemented by the manuscripts in the Bibliotheque Royale that 
Burnouf lectured on the Rig-Veda But he never published any 
extensive work on it His incidental comments are embodied in his 
commentary on the Yagna 

Burnouf not only told Muller what Vedic mss were to be found 
m the Bibliotheque Royale, but lent him his own mss Muller then 
began to copy and collate all the manuscripts he could use, but he 
found to his astonishment that he was making many mistakes 
Therefore, in order to avoid the extra labour of comparing his own 
copies with the originals, he devised a method of using transparent 
paper and tracing every letter At first his progress was slow, but 
with practice he increased his speed, and his materials grew in 
extent and value 

Max Muller trod a lonely path, and worked independently of the 
other Sanskntists in the field, though he was engaged on a task 
which was most important and urgent in connexion with the Rig- 
Veda, namely, the publication of a full text with the commentary of 
Sayana Rudolph Roth, who with Muller, became the most notable 
scholar on the Rig-Veda , was several years his senior But they never 
got on well together, though they were fellow-pupils of Burnouf 

It has already been related how Muller came to England to carry 
on his work and secured the patronage of the East India Company, 
and how at last he settled at Oxford because the printing was being 
done by the University Press The work had begun in the early part 
of 1847 as soon as th e question of financing it had been decided At 
first progress was slow because many of the types had to be manu- 
factured, and printing Sanskrit needed 300 types What surprised 
Muller when he was superintending the printing from London was 
that on the proofs many of his own mistakes on the copy were either 
corrected or queried At last he asked if there was a Sanskrit scholar 
at Oxford who was doing this He was told that there was none, but 
that it was the compositor himself, who did not know a word of 
Sanskrit, who was responsible for both When at Oxford he asked 
the man how he came to make the corrections ‘Well, sir, my arm 
gets mto a regular swing from one compartment of types to another, 
and there are certain movements which never occur. So, if I sud- 
denly have to take up types which entail a new movement I feel it, 
and I put a query 9 Of course, this was due to the fact that in all 
languages certain combinations (like s following an h in English) 
can never occur, and these impossibilities are numerous in Sanskrit 



THE RIG-VEDA 


139 

But by July 1847 the first two sheets of the text of the Rig-Veda 
were printed off, and on July 13, he sent them to Burnouf in Pans, 
followed by the first sheet of the commentary by Sayana on October 
8 His object in doing so was to obtain Burnouf’s opinion on the 
soundness of the general principle of printing and style that he had 
adopted The old scholar sent his enthusiastic approval in a letter 
written on November 9, 1847, writing T thank you for having sent 
me the sheets of your grand edition of the Rig-Veda I use the word 
grand, not to avoid saying excellent, for I consider it both grand and 
excellent, but because I must express my admiration of Professor 
Wilson’s fine and vigorous Devanagari type ’ 

As to the quality of the editing, Burnouf said T must own that 
I am astonished that in so short a time you have been able to master 
the mass of materials in hand 5 Then the old scholar and pioneer in 
France of Vedic studies, concluded with a generosity which is not 
common among specialists He wrote 

I congratulate you with all my heart on your debut, and I venture to 
say on your success, for your success is secured It is a great delight 
to do it for a man whose knowledge I admire and whose character I 
love And I think I may be allowed to reflect with pleasure on any 
effort I may have made to encourage you to march on in entire inde- 
pendence, avoiding all collaborations This is the only thing on 
which I can pride myself, and again it is entirely to your honour, be- 
cause it only proves that I recognized all that science might expect 
from you 


Anything nobler from an old scholar to a scholar of twenty-six 
can hardly be imagined. 

Max Muller steadily produced the sheets, and in two years 
finished the editing and printing of the first volume, which was 
published at the end of 1849 The Oxford University Press must be 
given the credit for producing a volume which in its beauty of 
typography and layout recalled to me some of the early incunabula 
from the presses of Aldus and Jenson The volume, a heavy quarto, 
was presented to the British Museum by the Court of Directors of 
the East India Company It is in mint condition, and on its flyleaf is 
pasted a letter in the beautiful handwriting of the day, forwarding 
it and explaining the scope of the work

SCHOLAR EXTRAORDINARY 


Sir, 

The Court of Directors of the East India Company impressed with 
a sense of the great Literary and Antiquarian Value of the ‘Rig-Veda 
Sanhtta 3 or Sacred Hymns of the Brahmans as containing important 
facts relating to the early Religion, History, and Language of the 
Hindoos, and actuated by a desire to perpetuate and render the Work 
accessible to the World of Letters, have authorized the publication at 
the Company’s expense of an Edition of the Manuscript, together 
with its Sanskrit Commentary by Sayanacharya , and the First Volume 
of the Work, which it is expected will be comprized in four volumes has 
now issued from the Press, Edited by Dr Max Muller of Berlin, under 
the general superintendence of Professor H H Wilson, the Com- 
pany’s Librarian 

The Work is intended for sale to those who may desire to possess it, 
but it is the intention of the Court to make gratuitous distribution of 
Copies to certain Public Institutions, and to a few distinguished indi- 
viduals, and the Court have commanded me to state that they have 
much pleasure in presenting a Copy of the first Volume, which is here- 
with forwarded for deposit in the Library of the British Museum 

The remaining volumes will be forwarded in like manner as they 
successively appear 

They were, and the six volumes of the first edition in the Depart- 
ment of Oriental Printed Books and Manuscripts of the British 
Museum are this presentation set bound in morocco 

One particular feature of bibliographical interest in this volume 
might be mentioned It had a second title-page in Sanskrit, in 
which Max Muller Sanskritized the names of Germany, Oxford 
and himself respectively as Sharmanya Desha (the Brahmimc 
country), Ukshatarana (ford of the Ox), and Bhatta Moksha Mulara 
(the learned Moksha Mulara, the nearest Sanskrit-sounding equiva- 
lent to his name, but later translated by the pandits of India as the 
‘giver of the root of salvation’ by means of an etymological flight 
worthy of Sayanacharya himself) Since, in boyhood, I often saw 
him mentioned as Moksha Mulara in Bengali magazines and books, 
I assumed that we in India had transformed his name mto an Indian 
form But from the first volume of his edition I discovered that it 
was Muller himself who was responsible for this 
After the publication of the first volume Muller proceeded with 
the preparation of the second volume, but his appointment as 
Deputy Taylorian Professor of Modern Languages prevented his 
giving full attention to the Rig-Veda Still he carried on for more

than two years, and finished the preparation of the greater part of 
volume two But towards the end of 1852 he fell ill, and found it 
advisable to follow the advice Bunsen had long been giving him, to 
engage an assistant for the Rig-Veda Bunsen also seems to have 
suggested the name of a Sanskrit scholar in Berlin, Dr Aufrecht 
Muller entered mto negotiations with him, and Aufrecht arrived at 
Oxford in the middle of December 1852 As this step was to pro- 
duce a very unpleasant sequel for Max Muller, and after his death 
for his wife, it is necessary to describe his relations with his assistant 
m some detail Early in December Muller wrote to Bunsen £ I expect 
Aufrecht daily You have always advised me to seek help, and I 
could no longer get through my work alone, with the many inter- 
ruptions caused by my health Aufrecht is a very conscientious 
scholar, and as far as the rest goes that will be all right ’ 

After that Muller reported to his mother on December 19 ‘Dr 
Aufrecht is a very clever man, a Sanskritist, etc. We work together, 
and he helps me with my Veda , for which I pay him enough to live 
here We shall try the plan at first for six months, and I hope it will 
go well. 5 

Aufrecht as a scholar seems to have been of the type which made 
Mock Turtle describe his classical master as an old crab Besides, 
he had not been baptized, and that caused him mental unsettle- 
ment So after a few weeks’ association with him Muller again 
wrote to his mother, on February 2, 1853 

I get on better with Aufrecht, but not so very well yet He decidedly 
desires to be baptized, but he does not feel inclined to talk to others on 
this point or anything connected with it It is possible that when he 
has once taken this step he may get to feel more inner satisfaction and 
confidence in friends But there can be no question about working 
together , for as soon as one presses him a little hard he draws his head 
mto a shell like a tortoise But I still hope that in time things will 
take a better shape 

Seventeen days later Muller writes to his mother again, and says 
‘I am very well and happy Aufrecht begins to “thaw”.’ During the 
Easter holidays of 1853 Aufrecht, according to his own wishes, was 
baptized by Bunsen’s son, Henry, who was an Anglican clergyman 
and Rector of Lilleshall 

The second volume of the Rig-Veda was published early in 1854, 
and in its preface, dated Christmas, 1853, Max Muller formally 



142 SCHOLAR EXTRAORDINARY 

acknowledged Aufrecht’s help for the first time in these words Tn 
the latter portion of this volume I have been able to avail myself of 
the assistance and active co-operation of my learned friend Dr 
Aufrecht of Berlin, and the benefit hence derived cannot be too 
highly valued 5 

On March 10 he wrote to his mother ‘Aufrecht is still working 
for me, but he lives in another house for himself, and gives private 
lessons He is happy here, and very useful to me, but it is rather 
expensive ’ 

At the beginning of 1855 Aufrecht decided to leave Max Muller 
and Oxford, and to go to London, So Muller wrote to Bunsen 
‘Aufrecht has at last made up his mind to go to London I have 
written to Dr Jelf, who may probably secure for him the Sanskrit 
Professorship at King’s College Aufrecht was too good for this 
mechanical work ’ 

In the preface to the third volume, published in 1856, Muller 
acknowledged Aufrecht’s assistance as follows T have had again 
for this volume the valuable assistance of my learned friend Dr 
Aufrecht, and I sincerely regret that I shall no longer enjoy this 
advantage ’ 

Finally, in the preface to the fourth volume published in 1862, 
Muller wrote 

I have stated on former occasions how much I owed to the assistance 
of my learned friend Professor Aufrecht, and I am glad to say that in 
the present volume also I have to a considerable extent had the benefit 
of his co-operation Though I regret his departure from Oxford, 
nothing could have been more beneficial to the interests of sound 
Sanskrit scholarship in this country than his appointment to the Chair 
of Sanskrit at Edinburgh 

After the departure of Aufrecht Muller secured the help of other 
young Sanskrit scholars, and carried through the work to its com- 
pletion by publishing the fifth volume in 1872 and the sixth in 1874 
On July 1 Max Muller wrote the last lines of his text of the Rtg~ 
Veda , and only the preface remained to be written 
The first International Congress of Orientalists was held in 
London from September 14 to 21, 1874 To it came all the dis- 
tinguished Oriental scholars of the day, including Max Muller’s 
first teacher of Sanskrit, Brockhaus Muller presided over the Aryan 
section and delivered a very eloquent address on the importance of 



THE RIG-VEDA 


143 


Oriental studies and learning At the end of the address he pre- 
sented the last sheet of the last volume of the Rtg-Veda to the Con- 
gress The volume was published at the end of the year, and in its 
preface he took leave of the work in the style of Gibbon ‘When I 
had written the last line of the Rtg-Veda and Sayana’s commentary, 
and put down my pen, I felt as if I had parted with an old, old 
friend ’ 

In the preface Muller also clearly explained how he had worked 
with his assistants and acknowledged their help 

I believe I have acknowledged, without stmt, whatever assistance I 
have received from other scholars durmg the progress of my work 
They themselves have assured me, that I have said more than they 
deserved or expected I have never liked the rule, followed by nearly 
all scholars, of not acknowledging services for which payment has 
been accepted But as it has been broadly hinted, that for certain por- 
tions of Sayana’s commentary, I had parted with my editorial respon- 
sibility, I take this opportunity of stating, once for all, that there is no 
page, no line, no word, no letter, no accent, in the whole commentary, 
for which I am not personally responsible 

At this point I must go back to Max Muller’s first detailed exami- 
nation and description of the Rtg-Veda and the whole of Vedic 
literature, which was published in 1859 Already, when he was com- 
pleting the first volume of his presentation of the text of the Rtg- 
Veda , Muller had written a long explanatory essay, both descriptive 
and historical, on Vedic literature, and he wished to print it as a pre- 
face to the volume With the approval of Bunsen he wrote a letter 
to the Court of Directors of the East India Company seeking per- 
mission to do so 

The Directors agreed to his petition, which was a great sui prise 
to Muller This happened thiough Bunsen’s intervention Max 
Muller thought he would print and publish it in England, and a note 
was inserted in the first volume announcing that an introductory 
memoir on the literature of the Vedas was ready for publication 
Ten sheets of the essay were printed by 1851, when he was 
appointed Deputy Taylorian Piofessor and had to give up the pro- 
ject for want of time. However, he adapted parts of the intended 
prolegomena into an essay for the Prix Volney awarded by the 
Institute of France The competition was hard, but Burnouf and 
other friends worked foi him, and e,*rly in. October 1849 Burnouf 



144 SCHOLAR EXTRAORDINARY 

gave him the glad news that he had got the prize, which was 1,200 
francs 

For ten years Muller could do nothing further with the essay, 
but in 1859 he brought it out as his first full-length book, A History 
of Ancient Sanskrit Literature , and dedicated it to Horace Hayman 
Wilson, as ‘a token of admiration and gratitude by his pupil and 
friend, Max Muller' In the meanwhile, a good deal of work had 
been done by other scholars who had concerned themselves with 
the Vedas In the preface to his book Muller mentioned the names 
of Wilson, Burnouf, Lassen, Bemfey, Roth, Boehthngk, Kuhn, 
Regmer, Weber, Aufrecht, Whitney, among the most notable 
workers He himself had also published a short essay on the Vedas 
m 1853 He regretted that owing to external circumstances he had 
been anticipated by others in producing a general account of Vedic 
literature, but that regret was balanced by his satisfaction in finding 
that in the mam his original views had not been shaken either by his 
own further researches or by those of others Quite deliberately the 
preface of the book was dated August 3, 1859, ^he day of his wedding 
Like his marriage, the book was a great success It is surprising 
to note that this highly specialized book of 607 pages, containing 
in its index of 19 pages more than 1,500 Sanskrit words and names, 
and also Sanskrit citations in the text in Deva Nagan type, was com- 
pletely sold out in its first edition in less than five months, and a 
second edition had to be brought out in i860 There were also long 
and appreciative reviews not only in the learned journals but also 
in the newspapers The Times published a flattering review on 
December 30, 1859 Two of the scholarly reviews were by Wilson 
himself in the Edinburgh Review for October, i860 (the last thing 
he wrote, but published after his death), and by the great French 
Orientalist Barthelemy St Hilaire, in five articles in the Journal des 
Savants , the famous journal of scholarship 
The French scholar said that Muller's book showed considerable 
progress in Vedic studies and answered a number of questions, and, 
above all, it brought order and light into the huge and confused 
treasure-house of the primitive monuments of Brahmanic religion 
According to him the book was of so high an order that it was not 
likely to be surpassed or even equalled for a long time Wilson 
wrote Tt is not possible in a brief survey like the present to render 
justice to a work every page of which teems with information that 
no other scholar ever has, or could have, placed before the public * 



THE RIG-VEDA 


145 


A third edition of the book was also called for But Max Muller 
thought that Yedic studies were making such rapid progress that 
with the time he could give to the subject he could not keep abreast 
of it His failure to get the Boden Professorship of Sanskrit at 
Oxford at the end of i860 made it impossible for him to devote 
himself exclusively to Sanskrit literature To carry on the publica- 
tion of the text of the Veda was in itself a task heavy enough So he 
never re-published this pioneering book 

But he did not feel happy about it In a letter to his wife written 
on December 7, 1864, he said ‘I still have a great work to do, and 
I often feel that I might have done a great deal more, if I kept the 
one object of my life more steadily in view I sometimes wish you 
would help me more in doing that, and insist on my working harder 
at the Veda and nothing else I hope I shall finish that work * Then 
he explained to her how his edition and translation of the Veda 
was likely to help the Hindus in recovering the original spirit of 
their religion (see p 90) and observed ‘If those thoughts pass 
through one’s mind, one does grudge the hours and days and weeks 
that are spent in staying in people’s houses, and one feels that with 
the many blessings showered on one, one ought to be up and doing 
what may be God’s work ’ 

Notwithstanding his self-accusation, he continued to work on 
both the text and translation of the Rig-Veda Moreover, till almost 
the end of his life he never neglected any opportunity to explain the 
meaning and importance of the Vedas to a larger public He de- 
livered a long lecture at Leeds in March, 1865, before its Philoso- 
phical Institution, devoted five of his seven lectures at Cambridge 
m 1 88a to the Vedas , and, last of all, summed up his views on them 
in the second volume of Auld Lang Syne , containing recollections of 
his Indian friends, among whom he counted the Rig-Veda That 
was in 1898, two years before his death 

He even made use of social occasions to promote knowledge and 
respect for Vedic literature When the phonograph was invented 
one of its first appearances in England was at a party at the house of 
J. Fletcher Moulton, Q c , and afterwards in P There was a fashion- 
able company, with some eminent men of letters and men of science 
Among them was also the American journalist, a friend of Max 
Muller’s, Moncme D Conway, who in his long notice on Muller 
after his death, published in the North American Review , described 
the incident. I shall quote his account 



146 SCHOLAR EXTRAORDINARY 

Max Muller was first called on to utter something in the phonograph 
We presently heard issuing from it these sounds Agmm tie purohitam 
Yajnasya dev am ntvtjam — hotaram ratnadhatamam 
There was a burst of merriment when these queer sounds came from 
the machine, but a deep silence when Max Muller explained that we 
had heard words from the oldest hymn in the world — the first (if I 
remember rightly*) in the Vedas ‘Agm I worship — the chief priest of 
the sacrifice — the divine priest — the invoker — conferring great wealth * 

And then young people gathered round the smiling scholar to ask 
questions Moncure Conway did not hear exactly what Muller said 
to them because he 

stood apart observing the picturesqueness of the scene, and finding in 
it something symbolical of the whole career of the polite scholar He 
had evoked from the oral Sanskrit phonograph the ancient Aryan 
literature and mythology, the thin, metallic voices became real and 
cast their poetic spell not merely on the learned, but on fashionable 
young ladies and gentlemen in drawing-rooms, throughout Europe and 
America, adding vast estates to then minds, delivering them from the 
mere^pmhole views of humanity and of the universe to which our 
ancestors were limited 

I shall end this chapter by adding to Conway’s vivid account of 
the impact of his work on the Vedas , the observation on it of one of 
the leading Sanskrit and Vedic scholars of our times, in Louis 
Renou ‘Nul n’a contnhue davantage / he says in a monograph en- 
titled Les Maitres de la Philologie Vedique 3 c a creer le miracle vedique, 
consacre par une revelation surnaturelle, entretenu par d’exceptionelles 
cir Constances y il a apporte au service de cette cause le tribut d y un art et 
d’une science egales ’ 


* It is the first verse of the Rig-Veda

BEATA GEORGINA 

There is a gap of two years in the story of Max Muller’s love for 
Georgina Grenfell, between the spring of 1854 when his proposal 
for marriage was rejected by her family, and the spring of 1856 
when a love affair acknowledged and accepted by Georgina but 
without any hope of marriage began for them What happened in 
the intervening years is unrecorded both in the published biography 
and unpublished papers All that can be said is that Muller did not 
forget his love, and remained dejected But since he did not meet 
Georgina his suffering was not such that he could not put on a 
brave face to his mother, as he felt he must, because he knew that 
nothing would distress her more than the knowledge of his being 
unhappy in love So, to one of her letters written in 1855, in which 
there was the usual insistence on his marrying and even a suggestion 
as to a possible wife, he replied with humour ‘That you are so 
anxious to find me a wife is very good of you 1 Elise who de- 
lighted you so much in Carlsbad, seemed to me pleasant enough, 
but as I had no opportunity of knowing her better, I have never 
thought more about her If you are writing greet her kindly, but 
don’t make any proposal for her hand*’ The future Mrs Muller, on 
the othei hand, knew nothing of Max Muller’s love and was not 
herself consciously in love But the whole aspect of their relations 
changed dramatically in the early summer of 1856 

In her biography of her husband Mrs Max Muller was naturally 
very reserved about her marriage She briefly described his first 
visit to her father in November 1853, an -d set down what 
Muller had told her later about his final commitment to her from 
that very meeting As regards the second meeting from which a 
two-sided love affair started, she only wrote ‘In April of this year 
Max Muller had again met his future wife, and during six weeks 
they saw each other constantly at her home, and in London, and at 
the Grand Commemoration and Peace festivities in Oxford, little 
foreseeing the painful three years of total silence and separation 
that they had to go through before their marriage was allowed ’ But 
her own journal and Max Muller’s letters reveal a tragic experience

of suffering It is a story of romantic love without a ray of hope, until 
it ended suddenly and unexpectedly in happiness 

It has to be told at some length not only as an essential part of 
Max Muller’s life, or as a romance which no one would expect to be 
experienced by a scholar, but also for its historical interest as a part 
of the attitude to love in nineteenth-century England The idea of 
love which finds permanence in marriage without losing its inten- 
sity has become very distant in this age What has taken its place is 
the concept on which polygamy is based, with the difference that 
while the Hindu or the Muslim polygamist uses a number of women 
as notes in a simultaneously sounded chord, the modem Western 
polygamists play them arpeggio , making marriage very much a 
matter of sexual convenience, and their love life is an alternation of 
crests of infatuation with troughs of disillusionment, except for those 
who are too humdrum to enjoy that game of chance 

Vanitas vanitatum 3 omnia vanitas , and nobody saw the vanity 
more clearly than the great Christian Pascal, who said ‘A sense of 
the hollowness of present pleasures and failure to perceive the 
hollowness of absent pleasures cause inconstancy * The Victorians, 
on the contrary, succeeded in a very great measure in reconciling 
the intensity of love with its concentration on one object This is 
most strikingly illustrated in a letter which Sir George Otto Tre- 
velyan wrote to his daughter-in-law in 1908 at the age of seventy, 
when his wife was away from home for a few days T am never un- 
happy for a few days with work and solitude , for that amount of 
solitude, brief, and at long intervals, introduces an element of con- 
templation and recognition into one’s feelings about the person 
whose presence makes one’s life ’ Of course, many such examples 
can be given 

That does not mean, however, that at any level love between man 
and woman is free of the sexual urge Only a fool or a hypocrite 
will deny that this love originates in sexual desire and seeks its 
rhythmic fulfilment in physical union But only a fool will say that 
it is all sexual desire or lust, finding its ultimate satisfaction in a 
tactile sensation We Hindus committed that mistake and have paid 
the price So will the Western people if they go our way From the 
beginning of time men have been adding values and colours to this 
primordial urge until fully evolved love has become as differentiated 
from basic lust, as old port is different from absinthe, though both 
contain alcohol Indeed, the sublimation has gone further, and it

has made many ardent lovers feel that it is not of the order of the 
flesh, being a human replica of the love of and for God Max Muller 
held this view, or, to be more accurate, had this sort of feeling about 
love On the page of the journal of his future wife on which I read 
his confession of love at first sight, I also read ‘There can be no 
true and lasting love that has not its spring and life in God’ , also this 
‘I felt we had this in common — our love to the same God, our faith 
m the same saviour, and our will to make our life on earth a sacrifice 
to him ’ His future wife, as I shall show presently, also held the 
same quasi-religious view of love 

In feeling in this way about love neither Max Muller nor Georgina 
were taking up any position which could be called individual We are 
hardly aware that what we call individual choice is normally nothing 
more than a particular adaptation to the general historical situation 
in which a person is placed In this case both the lovers stood at the 
convergence, in mid-nineteenth century England, of three historical 
trends, and therefore their love has to be placed in its historical 
setting These trends were — the Protestant rehabilitation of mar- 
riage, the romantic glorification of sexual love, and the Victorian 
transformation of the love of the Romantic Movement into married 
love Each of these has to be considered by itself 

The Protestant rehabilitation of marriage was a revolt against the 
Catholic Church’s prohibition of marriage for the clergy, and the 
corresponding attitude which regarded marriage only as a pis aller 
for those who remained in the world Sexual relations had the taint 
of original sm even in wedlock, and it was to rescue them from this 
taint that the Catholic Church made marriage a sacrament All these 
stemmed from the Pauline view that it was better to marry than to 
burn Luther fiercely rejected both celibacy of the clergy and the 
sacramental character of marriage But he asserted unambiguously 
that God himself had instituted marriage, and thus the Roman 
Church’s prohibition of marriage for the clergy was no better than 
Antichrist’s mounting himself to a place above God In his Be 
Captivitate Babylonica Ecclesiae he stressed the sacred and mys- 
terious nature of marriage among believers and unbelievers alike 
This position was refurbished by a section of the Anglican clergy 
out of their revulsion from the unnatural emphasis placed on 
asceticism and virginity by the leaders of the Oxford Movement 
Mr Svaglic in his fine edition of Newman’s Apologia has pointed 
out that there was a passionate urge behind Kingsley’s attack on 



150 SCHOLAR EXTRAORDINARY 

him Kmgsley had found peace and had been able to reconcile the 
world and the spirit through his love for and marriage with Fanny 
Grenfell, and he revolted against the Catholic view which made such 
a pure bliss (derived as he thought from God) a sin Mr Svaglic 
also draws attention to the fact that Kingsley belonged to the circle 
of Carlyle, Froude, Tennyson, Shaftesbury and Bunsen, and shared 
their Germanic Protestant view of history, one of whose particular 
expressions was that the Reformation had reasserted the sanctity of 
marriage and the family, and revived the Teutonic virtues which 
had been suppressed by the Roman Church Max Muller belonged 
to the same circle 

There is direct evidence that Kmgsley held this view of sexual 
love and marriage In one of his letters to Max Muller he said he 
would fully decide in Muller’s favour if he were in Riversdale 
Grenfell’s place by saying to himself ‘The thing is of God, and I 
dare not fight against it ’ Furthermore, advising him to remain 
patient in his present disappointment, Kmgsley wrote Tt would be 
a great experiment, my comfort is, that it would be a great experi- 
ment in the highest sense of the word , a committing, as thousands 
have done, of true love into the hands of Him who inspired it, and 
saying, “God, Thou hast made this, surely Thou wilt also water and 
prune it till it bear fruit to everlasting life ”’ 

This will show to what school Muller’s love belonged But it 
belonged too at one remove to the romantic love of the early nine- 
teenth century, especially in its German expression The Romantic 
revolt against the rationalism of the eighteenth century also im- 
pinged on the man-woman relationship The rationalistic attitude 
tended to ignore the differences between the sexes, to favour their 
equality in respect of position, interests, activities and opportuni- 
ties, to emancipate women, and to create the femme forte Its impact 
on the physical relations between men and women attenuated 
passion and fostered sensuality To the pure rationalist the urge for 
sexual satisfaction is only a refined form of the urge to defecate, as 
was felt by Montaigne, the pioneer rationalist. You should not for 
your health’s sake resist it, but do not try to glorify it. 

The Romantic Movement rejected all this, lock, stock and barrel 
It proclaimed the particularity of man as well as woman, recognized 
the special genius and function of each, and thought that human 
life was made whole by a combination of the two As the Austrian 
Romantic, Lenau, put it 4 Who has genius ? Can woman have it ?

Fatuous question Man and woman have it conjointly 5 With this 
there was bound to go a glorification of the basic element in the man- 
woman relationship, sexual love This Romantic view of love treated 
marriage as an institution largely irrelevant to love In fact, it de- 
picted love at its most intense outside wedlock There were two 
natural if not good reasons for doing so first, marriage was almost 
wholly subject to worldly considerations in that age, and the 
Romantic, who thought this degrading, wanted to make love inde- 
pendent of the world, second, sexual satisfaction in wedlock was 
also the assertion of a legal right, and that made the ardent Roman- 
tic have the same feeling for it as we have foi income-tax Moreover, 
they had no revulsion from the physical expression of love But that 
was wholly different from the nonchalance about sexual intercourse 
of men and women of our days, who have made the act as amoral 
and neuro-muscular as playing tennis To the Romantics, in con- 
trast, the physical union was the climax of a passionate union 

The Germans took over the concept of Romantic love and prac- 
tised it with traditional German thoroughness, and the Germans 
who did so most thoroughly were also the most solid Germans, the 
philosophers and scholars As I have discovered, it is very unsafe 
and unsound to try to appraise a German of the Romantic Age by 
his books These give a wholly wrong idea of his personality, pas- 
sionate power and motives of action I have arrived at a more 
adequate image for the German scholar-philosopher he is the 
volcano which sends up hot, molten lava from his blazing depths, 
and that lava solidifies on the earth’s surface to become the hard 
basalt of his books 

Max Muller as lover was affiliated to that tradition Without 
assuming that, it is impossible to explain his equal devotion to the 
Rtg-Veda and to Georgina But living in England in the middle of 
the nineteenth century he could not be entirely a Romantic lover, 
not because Victonan England was cold and respectable but be- 
cause that England had gone one step further in romanticism by 
bringing the illicit and burning love of the Romantic Age into 
married life It had carried out a revolution through which the wife 
became a greater idol than the mistress, and so no husband could 
say of her, like La Rochefoucauld II ne faut pas parley de sa femme 
To put it briefly, love retained all the strength and lure it had as sin, 
and yet became sanctified in wedlock The Victorians were stodgy 

m their moralizing but not in their love-making.

Since the words of love which Robert spoke to Elizabeth were 
heard and sanctioned by God, not all the Barretts of Wimpole 
Street could prevent her from becoming Mrs Browning Coventry 
Patmore defined love in marriage more directly 

The love of marriage, above 
All other kinds, the name of love, 

As perfectest, though not so high 
As love which Heaven with single eye 
Considers, Equal and entire, 

Therein benevolence, desire, 

Elsewhere ill-joined or found apart, 

Which now contracts, and now dilates, 

And both to the height exalting, mates 
Self-seeking to self-sacrifice 

These men and women, living in a profoundly religious age, had 
no streak of asceticism Far from it, they even obliterated the dis- 
tinction which the early Christians, horrified by the Pagan lusts of 
the flesh, had drawn between Agape and Eros Max Muller moved 
naturally into this world of love What his love for Georgina was 
before his marriage I shall presently describe, but its character is 
even more intensely and truly revealed in a letter he wrote to her a 
year after his marriage. 

I went under the old Ilex tree and there I sat down and read it [her 
letter], and thought for a long time about my darling, and my happi- 
ness, and my unworthmess, and God's unbounded mercy 1 And then 
I heard the words within me, ‘Be not afraid Yes, my darling, there 
must be no fear When there is fear, then there is no perfect love Our 
happiness here is but a foretaste of our blessed life hereafter, we must 
never forget that We shall be called away, my darling, but we shall 
meet again My darling Georgina, you would sleep quietly and 
peacefully in the arms of your husband — but our Father in Heaven 
loves us more than any husband can love his wife, or any mother her 
child His hand will never hurt us So let us hope and trust always 

I cannot say that all this was typical of the academic life of Oxford 
Its monastic past, together with the obligation of celibacy for the 
fellows, made the dons either suspicious or incapable of love, and to 
this suspicion and incapacity a man, regarded as the incarnation of 
the Oxford spirit and who was also a friend of Max Muller, bears

witness He is no less a person than Benjamin Jowett His preoccu- 
pation was purity of life, and he set it down in his notebook that a 
man was not a man who did not control his passions He uses the 
word ‘passion’ in a bad sense But he was also aware how difficult it 
was for Oxford dons to master their passions, because their mar- 
riage was deferred generally for fifteen or twenty years after the 
passions were strongest, and was sometimes impossible without 
loss of rank The social downgrading through marriage was de- 
scribed by a Highland girl who saw Oxford just before Max Muller’s 
time, and she wrote that many heads of colleges, constant to the 
loves of their youth, brought ladies of inferior manners to grace 
what was so dignified a station in life 

But even Oxford dons could love The lecturer in mathematics 
at Christ Church, Dodgson, better known as Lewis Carroll, fell in 
love with his Alice when she grew into a beautiful girl of sixteen, 
and had to be tacitly forbidden the house by Mrs Liddell, the 
famous Dean’s wife Mark Pattison, the most desiccated and calci- 
nated of Oxford dons, married a very young girl probably out of 
love Even the great Benjamin Jowett had a romance with the even 
greater Florence Nightingale But all these men outgrew and sur- 
vived their love, though not the spleen which is a by-product of un- 
requited love Lewis Carroll nursed a life-long spite against the 
Liddells, and even against their friends, one of whom was Max 
Muller, and Mark Pattison drove his wife into the arms of Sir 
Charles Dilke 

But the German Max Muller would certainly not have survived 
his love, if denied Actually, he once wrote to Miss Grenfell. T am 
a German, full of foolish romantic ideas, which give me happiness 
where no Englishman or woman would find it ’ But, as it happened, 
even in Victorian England his love did not end in tragedy, because 
he was not being slam by a cruel fair maid , on the contrary, Georgina 
herself was on the point of pining away It was an English father, 
insisting on a proper settlement for his daughter, who was putting 
impediment in the way of true love, and Max Muller could not 
employ the method by means of which in that age lovers of equal 
social and economic status could make the best of both worlds 
that is, by keeping the love-making to themselves and leaving the 
settlement to their solicitors 

The new act opened in April, 1856, with a letter from Max 
Muller to Miss Grenfell telling her about the accommodation he 



154 SCHOLAR EXTRAORDINARY 

had arranged for the Ray Lodge party at Oxford for the grand cele- 
bration there of the close of the Crimean War, at which Jenny Lind 
was to sing at two concerts 'The arrangements/ he wrote, 'will be 
somewhat Crimean, I fear, yet I have no doubt that the battle will 
be won There is one large bedroom and two small ones, so your 
maid will have to sleep in a neighbouring house If I had known 
yesterday I could have offered a bed to Mr Grenfell in my house 
I have secured carriage room and stalls for two horses, and beds 
for two servants, and by a most fortunate accident I got a ticket for 
the first concert ’ Then he gave details of the programme he had 
arranged and this included lunches and dinners and balls at many 
colleges, outings, and even visits to the Observatory where they 
were to see the Observer’s Heliometer and the stars generally The 
whole visit was most gay and festive 

It was at the end of the visit that Max Muller and Georgina 
Grenfell declared their love for each other, probably on June 5, one 
day before the Grenfells returned to Ray Lodge Muller’s inscrip- 
tion on his future wife’s journal ‘Zur Ennnerung an den 5 en Juni , 
1856 , Oxford ’ bears testimony to the date But the episode is de- 
scribed with anguish by Georgina Grenfell in the very first entry of 
her journal kept from the middle of 1856 onwards She writes 

Ray Lodge, June 7 Returned from Oxford yesterday — I had such a 
sad ending to our gay week My poor little Muller I cannot bear to 
think of his grief In an agony he told me of his faithful love, and how 
for ever he should love me — and though I feel Papa is right, with his 
little income, in now saying No y yet I cannot but think of him What 
can it be in me that could win such intense love from him ? He in such 
real grief To hear such a man say that he felt that for two years his 
powers had been gomg, and to know that one word would make him 
happy, and that one might not, could not say that word, yes, it was 
trying mdeed My poor Muller But there are years before us and they 
all say some day he must hold a very high position and then perhaps 
Meantime, should not the love of such a man raise one ? I felt humbled 
by his fixing on me What am I compared to him ? Let me try in every 
way to raise my mind and be more fit to become the wife of one with 
such a mind 

This journal, kept over three years, is an extraordinary document 
It was as if the intensity of the love set down seemed to burn the 
very pages, and it would seem nobody but Max Muller and his wife

had read it before me Of its eighty pages, sixty-eight describe her 
suffering over the three years during which her father would not 
hear of her marriage with Max Muller, and this suffering is borne 
with such tenderness, stoicism and religious fervour that the pages 
read like a Magnificat in sorrow The rest of the pages, only twelve, 
record her joy and gratitude at being permitted to accept him, and 
they utter a Gloria in excelsis in happiness 

What strikes the reader in the first instance in this journal is the 
extraordinary frankness and honesty of the record On September 
20, 1857, she asked herself 'Is it wise to write down all the thoughts 
that course thro’ the mind and answers herself ‘Yes, I think it 
does good if they are true ones 9 1 quote some passages to show that 
there can be no doubt about the frankness and truthfulness, and also 
to establish the key, and sound the leit-motives, of her love She 
writes on July 10, 1859, when she and Max Muller were meeting as 
affianced lovers ‘In the evening we stayed from Church and after 
sitting with Gommy [Miss Grenfell] sat together under the Ilex 
tree and then late at night we went to Charlotte’s arbour, and sat 
there heart to heart, till our souls seemed one, the mere bodily 
covering seemed too full of love and joy There are not many such 
hours in this workaday world, but they are pricelessly precious I * * * 5 
The next day brought a different kind of experience, and it is 
described in the next entry 'Max and I sat in the boat together It 
was very hot, and I was very cross, because he would kiss me I have 
since been very unhappy about it, for there was a grieved look in his 
eyes at my childish behaviour, which I could not bear to see again 
We sat and looked in each other’s eyes I often can hardly bear to 
meet his eyes I feel I am not worthy of all that God has given me, 
and then I shut my eyes or look into the far blue sky, and pray to 
be worthy of my own Max ’ 

She also makes no secret of her love affairs before she had finally 
fixed her love on him, and even of her waverings after she had She 
wrote on May 31, 1857 

I did not think I could so deeply and truly love anyone Before a year 

had passed from Captain HGW I was flirting most violently with 

Colonel Vyse I had all along thought in spite of myself that I had 
wasted a great deal of feeling on him, indeed I told Max so 

Charlotte tells me on good authority that he did really care for me, but 
that Papa would not hear of it, and hinted so to H G W , and this 

stopped all his attentions in that sudden way Somehow I am glad to 



156 SCHOLAR EXTRAORDINARY 

hear this, for tho’ I own it would have been a poor life with him and 
that I soon got over the feeling and that my love to Max is real and 
true, yet I did care for H G W very much and with all a girl’s eager 
feeling, and therefore I am glad to hear that he was not a mere flirt, 
attracted for a time by my lovely face 

She prays that she may not give in to coquetry, and at the very 
beginning of her passionate surrender to Max Muller sets down this 
prayer ‘Oh God, help me watch myself very carefully that womamty 
may [not ?] draw me from him ’ Even in 1857, when she was in deep 
despair and distress of mind, she wrote ‘If anyone were ever to see 
this book what would they think of me I had my whole time passed 
m affaires de cceur ? Why am I allowed to make so many unhappy ? 
Am I really careful enough or do I not like incense, and thus en- 
courage these poor men? I will be far more circumspect Loving 
another as I do, I ought to be as indifferent as possible to everyone * 
Furthermore, she does not suppress the natural envy that she 
feels and the sense of injustice that she has, when she sees others 
happy in their love, even her younger sister Charlotte ‘I have been 
staying with Mary Goodlake, seeing and enjoying her little home — I 
often wonder why such discipline is needed by Muller and me. I am 
so down tonight I could cry for hours Ah * why cannot I find rest 
m God 5 After this entry comes another ‘There is Mabel Irby, who 
from the way she has gone on, cannot be capable of a deep true 
feeling, about to marry that clever Augustus Vansittart, and there 
are no difficulties of any kind Such is life — One glad and another 
miserable* Oh* Lord my God, keep my own dear Muller, in body, 
soul, and spirit as Thine ’ 

Last of all, she was capable of being extraordinarily realistic 
about money, the cause of her suffering On October 10, 1856, she 
wrote 

Gommy went to Eversley [Kingsley’s living] and saw Muller and, of 
course, they talked long of the subject His love for me is unchanged, 
and mine for him is as strong as ever Only I see now clearly all the 
difficulties He has .£500 from his Professorship and makes nearly £300 
more by his writings, and my fortune could ensure the sum Papa 
demands This is small, but next year he will have £100 more I have 
thought it all over deeply, and I think I shall wait till next year, as I 
am now, and then see if in any way the thing is settled either way by 
external influences, if not I will try again to get Papa’s consent.

But the next year only brought new difficulties, and she wrote on 
April 1 8 ‘All this week I have been tried by feeling that perhaps I 
ought to give up Muller 1 Papa seems as determined as ever against 
it — and my friends even think would, if dead, leave some clause 
leaving away my fortune if I married Max, and I know no one could 
live on Max's income alone and make any provision for the future ’ 
As a matter of fact, she came to know later that he had altered his 
will, so that if his daughter had married Max Muller she would 
have had nothing 

But with all her honesty and realism she knew equally well that 
she could not give up Max, even if she would So, on the very day 
on which she set down her sensible view about money, she also 
wrote ‘I know many would say “Give him up", but it is like cutting 
away the ground under my feet I think I shall put it all before

These samples should be enough to convince anybody of the 
honesty and frankness of an English girl of the Victorian Age, 
brought up in typical squirarchal surroundings, and also to give 
glimpses of her capacity for love I shall now set forth the story of 
her love in her own words, which will fully reveal her passionate 
intensity This should go to show that the idea that the Victorians 
were given to suppressing their passion is a myth There is no 
evidence for it in fact or fiction, rather, the evidence to the contrary 
is decisive The Victorians had no sense of guilt even about their 
libertinism, and seduced or committed adultery with as light a 
heart as anybody could do today, only perhaps with greater ele- 
gance and dignity The Victorian rake was as thoroughbred as his 
hunter, and the virtuous Victorians on their part had no sense of 
guilt about their virtue 

Georgina Grenfell was a modern Heloise in that her love was in- 
separable from her religion and morality There is not one sentence 
m her whole confession in which her love is not placed under the 
eyes and in the hands of her God The whole journal is written in

June 8, 1856 The Sacrament today such a real help Long and 
deeply did I pray for dear Muller, that whatever was for our good 
might be done, and that in ‘silence and prayer* we might bear all that 
God sends

June 28, 1856 Thank God after three weeks of sad anxiety and 
earnest prayer for him I have today heard that my dear Muller is more 
peaceful and enjoying the idea of his mother coming Ah* were it not 
for deep earnest prayer, how could one bear it ? I cannot think of his 
grief Such a man Why, why am I allowed to cause sorrow to such a 
mind 7 God keep me true to him Every day I think more of him and 
feel if for our good God will order it all and allow it — But if it may 
never be, Gh f my God teach him to forget, lay not deep sorrow on him 

August 2, 1857 'Take from us all things hurtful and give us those 
things which be profitable for us ’ How very difficult to put up this 
prayer in faith and resignation — Yet God knows all and we can by no 
effort of ours make or mar His plans If He sees this right for us, then 
no power on earth can prevent it Shall we not wait on him then, and 
strive to possess our souls in patience ? 

After considering the financial situation of Muller, Georgina 
Grenfell had decided that for the present she would say goodbye to 
the subject and prayed to God to keep her true to Muller and her- 
self But only a few days later she had to write 

October 19, 1857 'Thou knowest not what a day may bring forth’ — 
'Man proposes, but God disposes’ — How easy to say and write this, 
but how hard to really believe and acquiesce in it I resolved when I 
closed this book ten days ago it should not be opened again for many 
months and yet in these ten days the story of my life has been decided 

On the 14th she got a letter from Max Muller begging her to 
settle the question in one way or another She at once wrote to her 
father entreating him to allow their marriage, and telling him how 
her whole heart was Muller’s, but he would not So, 'feeling that 
my first duty was to my father’, she wrote to Muller on the 17th to 
tell him that all was over and to say farewell Then she set down her 
feelings in her journal 

Thus the whole joy of my life is gone and his Ah* I cannot face his 
sorrow and I write this calmly, but Oh ! the storm withm It is hard to 
submit to duty It is bitter to give up all the happiness of life at twenty- 
two It is wrong to say this for may not God have other joy in store 
for me and for him ? — but I cannot bear the idea of joy now 

On the last day of 1857 she steels herself to bear her sorrow, re- 
minding herself of the greater suffering of her people in India 
during the Mutiny

Dec 31, 1857 Nearly gone and with it my hope? No, I cling to 
him I cannot yet give him up 1 My Max who loves me with the tender- 
ness of a woman, and the strength of a man Oh f Lord may Thy 
richest blessing be with him now and ever, and grant me grace to see 
Thy hand in every event, and bow before Thee How many have lost 
relatives this year or suffered agonies for them, how many have 
endured mutilation and worse and shall I murmur at a grief which 
more or less seems to fall to nearly everyone ? 

She puts up this prayer at the beginning of 1858 

At sacrament today I prayed earnestly for grace to watch against and 
overcome the cross and bitter feelings that I know are in my heart 
My love for Muller should not have this effect on me No 1 God grant 
me strength to feel more for others, to mix more in their pursuits, and 
to quell the angry feelings that rise in my heart Doubt and disappoint- 
ment are difficult to bear But am I domg myself and Muller justice by 
giving way to angry, even peevish feelings ? No, with God’s help they 
shall be conquered 

To illustrate her faith in God in her suffering I shall quote only 
one other entry, set down on May 1, 1859, and only twelve days 
before the event which was to make her father agree to her marriage 
with Muller ‘What would life be*, she writes, £ if one could not take 
every care to God — little cares or worries which can be breathed to 
no human ear, but which one may lay before our heavenly Father, 
the gracious God to “whom all hearts be open, all desires known,” 
even when hardly known to oneself ’ 

This mingling of intense religious feeling with love shown by 
Georgina could be expected in mid-Victorian England, where 
faith was becoming more assertive and active than in the age imme- 
diately previous because of the growth of philosophic doubt and 
scientific disbelief But the devout high-seriousness which it 
generated was still exceptional in the upper classes, for whom world- 
lmess was an inheritance in entail 

The menfolk of the Grenfell family were of the normal type, and 
so Kingsley, Georgina’s uncle, was very glad to see that she and his 
friend were drawn to each other by a common spirituality, and he 
wrote to Max Muller 

You are one of the few men to whom I have been drawn passionately at 
first sight When I found out that you loved her, my affection for you

deepened I should have liked any man the better for loving her but 
that you did so, was quite a triumph to me, because I knew that it was 
not [her] face merely which would attract you but that you had seen 
the inward spiritual grace which I had always known was there, dor- 
mant chiefly, but only waiting to be called out 

He also loved Georgina the better for being attracted to Muller 
He had always thought well of her character and pictured her to 
himself, as he put it, ‘as the model lady-of-the-manor in a large 
estate’ But this showed her wisdom, xn that brought up as she was, 
she should see ‘how much better a noble human soul was for her 
than wealth or rank’ 

But even this did not reassure Kingsley that Georgina would be 
happy on the £750 that Max Muller had, and he wrote 

No doubt that people could be as happy as angels, even in this expen- 
sive England, on that But when children come, and come they will, 
fast enough and too fast — you would find that very little indeed True, 
hundreds of thousands of educated people will be rich on that, but 
you must remember what her bringing up has been — she never has had 
a physical want, or a fancy, unsatisfied since she was born — She would 
give up these and ‘rough it’, for herself, easily enough if she is a true 
woman, and find a joy and an honour in sacrificing herself for her 
children, and in that fact lies the danger Don’t tell me of not letting 
her make sacrifices She will never let you find her out — Oh my dear 
Max, you don’t know the diabolical cunning of women when they 
intend to be angels 

Kingsley also warned Muller against an alternative evil which 
was worse 

Her family see what her husband cannot, and then come endless 
presents You cannot refuse them, ought not but they are most galling 
to all valiant men She cannot refuse them because they will go to her 
children or enable her to save for her children, and so is established a 
habit of aristocratic pauperism which does no soul good And worse, it 
tempts her to get into the chronic habit of pleading poverty, giving 
hints, all but begging 

This would not have happened, Kingsley added, if she had no 
rich relations, but since she had, Kingsley concluded with a final 
word of advice. ‘Oh, Max, keep your feet and hers out of the net, 
and wait a while and all will go as God wills.’

Max Muller thanked Kingsley for his advice, saying ‘Your clear 
and decisive words have brought me more comfort than pam — they 
have driven away a swarm of vain hopes and plans, and the sooner 
they are scattered the better 5 But, as lover, he wholly rejected one 
part of the warning ‘Only one thing I must say If she is what I 
believe, and what you know her to be, all you write about aristo- 
cratic pauperism — true as it is and as I know it to be — applies as 
little to her as to Mrs Kingsley I share all your other fears, but this 
one I cannot share 9 

Whether Kingsley or Max Muller was right about Georgina on 
this score was never proved, because her father would not agree to 
the marriage even when in 1858 the emoluments of a Fellow of All 
Souls was added to Muller’s £750 or so But if she were put to the 
test she would have fully justified her lover’s confidence by never 
becoming an aristocratic pauper The stoicism with which she 
was bearing her sorrow at being forced to kill love for the sake of 
money, would not have left her if she had had love and little money 
She did not think it right even to indulge the sorrow Throughout 
the journal she tells herself that she must mope less, keep herself 
less aloof, and mix more with others in all their pleasures 

I have many many blessings — the love and approbation of so very 
many — a happy home, every temporal luxury and indulgence, so many 
dear ones round me I have many duties to perform, Father, aunt, 
brother, sister, servants and poor to comfort and influence I have great 
responsibilities — money, time and beauty to be well employed I have 
temptations — the peculiar foibles and sms of my own character, vanity, 
indolence, selfishness, the difficulties of my position — admired and 
spoilt , the little peculiarities of others to bear with quietly and kindly 
I have sorrows — one great, absorbing grief God grant I may read all 
its lessons aright When I look back I see such wasted time and talents, 
such forgetfulness of God When I look forward much seems dark and 
sad Let me cling to the ‘Now the present and the seen’ And here I 
would desire to live for others this year, help or comfort others I must 
strive that my own grief may not entirely engross me I must be often 
sad, for I would not leave Muller No 5 1 am too weak to resist the reac- 
tion I should then very likely make some foolish marriage, but I would

But there lurked a great danger to Max Muller in the very fervent 
religious sensibility of the women of the Grenfell family He could 
be attacked through it, and attacked he was, though not by his 
rivals in love The attack came from Oxford The dons there always 
thought that the deeds of God were manifest in their worldly 
advancement, and they were given to making a ruthless use of the 
odium theologicum to strike down competitors Two of the greatest 
figures of nineteenth-century Oxford, Pattison and Jowett, were 
both harmed in their careers by this, and Max Muller was to be 
also He was rejected for a professorship To begin with, however, 
someone tried to spoil his prospects in marriage, and complained to 
Miss Grenfell that he was an unbeliever How serious the con- 
sequences of such a charge could be can be gusssed from the entry 
which Georgma Grenfell set down in her diary on October 8, 1856 
‘Dear Muller 1 I know God will bless him I saw on Sunday night 
some reports that Gommy had received as to his religious opinions, 
in which he was called an unbeliever These deeply grieved me, and 
I felt, intense as the struggle would be, I must give him up, if he 
could not refute such reports 5 

Fortunately, Max Muller came to know about it, probably through 
Kingsley, and though he was busy with his mother who was ill and 
needed to be attended by him because she did not know English, he 
at once wrote to Miss Grenfell 

I feel I ought to write to you, if it were only to say, Do not believe un- 
charitable reports You know that in England more than anywhere

else, and in Oxford again, more than anywhere in England, religion 
has been dragged into party struggles, and many persons think it 
neither uncharitable nor sinful to call a man a heretic or unbeliever 
who differ from them on matters, concerning not so much the doctrine, 
as the discipline and policy of the Church Though I have abstained 
as much as possible from mixing myself up with any party, yet I know 
that the very fact of my bemg made Professor at Oxford,* has roused 
some angry feelings against me 

But he also honestly admitted that when he first came to Oxford 
he had spoken ‘rather strongly against those who, while they pro- 
fessed their faith so very loudly, seemed to be guided in their actions 
by principles so very different from those of Christianity* Then he 
concluded with the words 

Nothing is more dangerous, and nothing more apt to bring out the 
worst features of a man's character, than religious controversy The 
more we can avoid it, the better for ourselves and for others Faith, 
Love and Honour, as the old knights used to say, are treasures of 
which those speak least who profess them And does it not seem to you, 
that, as our love to our neighbours has its springs in our love to God, 
so where there is faith in God, there is also faith in man ? I can say no 
more today 

It would seem that Miss Grenfell was not wholly satisfied by this, 
for in his second letter on this subject he quotes a passage from her 
reply in which she said T could not consent to the union of her 
whom I had above all things desired to tram as a Christian, with 
one who would lead her away from faith in the Scriptures, and 
dependence on the Divine Teacher and Redeemer * This language 
hurt Muller very much, and he wrote an elaborate and almost 
panic-stricken apologia pro fidem suam to convince Miss Grenfell 
He began by telling her that it was impossible for him to defend 
himself if she did not believe him when he asked her not to believe 
m the accusation, and after that he dealt with his un-named 
accuser 

If I have said or written anything that has given offence to your friend, 
let me know it, and I shall then be able to defend myself But if some- 
one, without giving any proof, without giving even his name, tells you 

Taylonan Professorship of Modern European Languages on £500 a year in 
which he was confirmed by the Convocation on February 21, 1854

that I am an unbeliever, that I do not believe in the Bible, that I do not 
believe in Christ, our Lord and Saviour, I need not fear him I have 
many friends who know me and know my religious convictions, and 
though I have always avoided theological controversy, I have never 
avoided to express my faith in the doctrmes of Christianity where I felt 
called upon to do so 

Continuing, Max Muller said 

If you read the history of the Church you will find that all divisions 
and persecutions in the Church have arisen from the attempts of theo- 
logians to substitute their own thoughts and their own expressions for 
the simple language in which Christianity has been revealed to us in 
the Bible And if we know the dangers of religious controversy, if we 
see how it is opposed to the very spirit of Christianity and how it 
appeals to the worst passions, and destroys every feeling of charity, we 
ought to pity the priest or theologian who, like a physician, must enter 
into this pest house 

Max Muller’s plight was worse than that of Jowett when he was 
made to sign the Thirty-nine Articles Jowett was unrepentant and 
cynical As he wrote to Stanley, T have taken the meaner part and 
signed It seemed to me that I could not do otherwise without giving 
up my post as a clergyman ’ Muller could not afford such a mere 
formality It was bad enough to be rejected by the father for want 
of money, it would have been much worse to be rejected by the 
aunt for want of faith If he had known of Georgina’s attitude he 
would probably have been even more elaborate and earnest But as 
it was Georgina was wholly satisfied, and wrote in her diary after 
setting down her insistence on a refutation 

This he did in a letter that deepened my love to him, and made me feel 
more than ever that he would make me happy At the same time he 
said he had given up all hope of ever having me, and this made me feel 
I could not give him up 1 Therefore I have written and would wait in 
faith, prayer, and patience However it is, God will be with such a man, 
whose religious views are so deep and true, and in heaven if not on 
earth we may meet Dear Muller, I cannot cease to pray for him 

This true story of love is an example, among many others which 
may be found in the biographies of notable Europeans, of a rela- 
tionship of which we Hindus can learn nothing at first hand —

namely, the relationship that exists between love in life and love in 
literature But a full documentation illustrating it can be found in 
Europe Georgina Grenfeirs journal, for instance, has shown me 
the counterpart in life of the confrontation between love and 
morality or society and also of the combination of love with stoicism 
which is found in all the novels of Charlotte Bronte Take Jane 
Eyre , for example Loving Rochester passionately, she ran away 
from him and set down her judgement even when she was suffering 

Which is better? To have surrendered to temptation, listened to 
passion , made no painful effort — no struggle , but to have sunk down 
in the silken snare , fallen asleep on the flowers covering it , weakened 
in southern climate, amongst the luxuries of a pleasure villa to have 
been now living in France, Mr Rochester’s mistress Whether it is 
better, I ask, to be a slave in a fool’s paradise at Marseilles — fevered 
delusive bliss one hour — suffocating with bitter tears of remorse and 
shame the next — or to be a village school mistress, free and honest, in 
a breezy mountain nook in the healthy heart of England ? 

In all this Madame de Stael is not dead, she is simply reborn in 
Yorkshire 

But stoicism, efficacious as it is in helping a man to suffer without 
cowardly wailing, is still a philosophy of defeat in life, in fact, the 
grandest philosophy of defeat It cannot prevent those who are 
young from suffering because their flesh remains quick and has not 
yet been tempered or annealed to endure the pain, so that young 
stoics feel as if they had chosen to have a surgical operation without 
anaesthetic Georgina was resolved to be heroic but felt in the same 
way At the end of 1857 s ^ e writes 4 The year nearly gone, and 
though the summer was bright and gay, yet all the year there has 
been a deep slow undercurrent of sorrow and anxiety * I am so 
weary I long often for rest from it all like a tired child How will it 
end ?} Again she writes early in 1858 ‘All this tries me very much, 
and the spring time of life gone, and autumn seems gathering over 
without any summer I am very worn and weary, and long for rest/ 
At the beginning of 1 8 59, only a few months before the sudden happy 
turn in her life she sets down — ‘My twenty-third year gone. We 
bring our years to an end — so quickly they move from us and so fast 
does eternity draw on I thank God for the Past , and trust Him for 
the Future , only praying to serve Him in the Present' It is harrow- 
ing to read all this from a young girl of tw enty-three, but it is also 


166

chastening to do so in an age given over to peevish self-pity and 
boastful self-indulgence 

What adds to her sorrow is hei knowledge that Muller also loves 
her and is suffering as much as she is She felt too that all his suffer- 
ing was due to his love for a girl not wholly worthy of him She 
set down that conviction a few days after his declaration of love to 
her, and she reverts to the theme again and again ‘Except through 
deep love to him, I can never be fully, really worthy of him * Are 
my worldly advantages to be for a moment considered as equivalent 
to his mind and character > The hollow, vam world may think them 
so, I never can ’ 

Another thing which was causing sorrow to her was the thought 
of the unhappiness of the other young men who were falling in love 
with her T am worried,’ she writes, ‘about C S I do hope he is not 
to be made unhappy by me — he is too nice, for me to suspect a 
feeling in him I cannot return, without being sorry and vexed about 
it ’ In about ten days she feels more positive and writes ‘I have 
begged papa not to ask C S here so often, as it is very evident what 
his feelings are ’ Six months later she felt that she could not allow 
this to go on, and she gave Charles Scrobold his conge in very great 
sorrow ‘Poor Charles Scrobold,’ she wrote on August n, ‘will have 
received the blow to all his hopes today I sent a message yesterday 
by Gommy to his mother, to say it was hopeless ’ 

There are references to other suitors, who were found on discreet 
inquiry by the aunt to be far far too poor to think of marrying 
Georgina often thought over in her mind if it would not be better 
under the circumstances to give up Muller and seek peace if not 
happiness in marriage In February 1858 she wrote in her diary 
‘I feel sometimes that if some clever good man, whom I could 
respect, were to like me that would settle it But it would be a dread- 
ful undertaking, and yet unless Papa consented to my union with 
Max I must either make that sort of marriage or remain single all 
my life — for my heart and youth and soul are with Max ’ Mean- 
while, Max Muller had been suffering no less Actually, from the 
very morrow of his open declaration of love to Georgina he had 
ceased to hope For instance on July 3, 1856, less than a month 
from the declaration, he wrote to Miss Grenfell ‘How right you 
were when you said, Oh foolish man* Yes, I have been extremely 
foolish, and I feel I have fully deserved the penalty which I pay. 
But it is too late to lament over it now ’

He concluded the letter by giving his promise that she would 
hear no more complaints, and by even setting down his appreciation 
of Riversdale Grenfell T wish I could tell Mr Grenfell how fully 
I appreciate his motives, and how much I value the kindness and 
forbearance which he has shown to me on all occasions * 

But the extraordinary thing was that though everybody said that 
the matter was ended, nobody brought it to a conclusion For three 
years Muller and Miss Grenfell kept up this intimate and confidential 
exchange of letters, and Georgina saw some of them It was at the 
beginning of this correspondence that Miss Grenfell called for a 
vindication of Muller’s faith But why ? The Grenfells could have 
got rid of him finally by accepting the accusation at its face value 
without giving him any opportunity to justify himself, which, as has 
been seen, only deepened Georgina’s love for him But the mid- 
Victorian old maid continued to show affection and sympathy to 
Muller, and even consented to serve as an intermediary between 
him and her mece This would remain a puzzle unless one could 
revise one’s notion of a Victorian old maid 

Max Muller was equally despondent with others He confided in 
his intimate friend, Charles Kingsley, to whom he wrote on August 
io, 1857, from Leipzig 

I can wait and work — and sooner or later all this waiting and working 
will come to an end, for this life cannot last for ever and it will last 
no longer than we can bear it I have no right to complain I have all I 
wanted — more than I ever hoped for, more than I deserved A dis- 
appointment in love is hard to bear because it destroys our faith in our- 
selves and in everything else — a disappointment in marriage may be a 
life-long trial, but it need not destroy our faith in our own nature, in 
the truth of others, or in the wisdom of God I should like to see her 
once more before I go — but God knows best his season of blessings — 
and if I should never meet her again in this life, I feel that I owe to her 
more than I can tell you To say that it would have been better for me 
if I had never seen her, seems to be as foolish as to say, it would have 
been better for me if I had never been born No, no Life may grow 
more strange and awful every day — but the more it reveals to us its 
truest meanmg and reality, and the deepest depth of its divinity ‘And 
God saw everything that He had made, and behold it was very good ’ 

He kept Miss Grenfell informed about his work, his literary pro- 
jects and campaigns, and told her on one occasion 



168 SCHOLAR EXTRAORDINARY 

So you see I am in harness again, and I shall try to make up for the 
three years that I wasted in despair and misery Life was then a riddle, 
a foolish dream — I did not know for what purpose I should live and 
work It is so no longer, and the burden I shall have to bear, perhaps 
through the whole of my life, has become light and even dear to me 
since I know who wishes me to carry it 

But he can bear it only by thinking of the transcience of life T 
feel’, he says, ‘that much more than half of this earthly journey is 
finished — year after year seems to go more rapidly, and we shall have 
arrived sooner perhaps than we expect 5 He was then only thirty- 
five years of age 

In reply to another letter of Miss Grenfell’s in which she had 
mentioned that it was being written while the Septet of Beethoven 
was being played in another room, he wrote 

Your letter written with the accompaniment of Beethoven's Septet was 
all music to me What is time and space, and earth and life, and all that 
people call stern reality ? While I was reading your letter I was sitting 
m a quiet corner of your room — watching the dark cedar tree that 
stretches out its broad branches to bless you and your house, and I 
listened to every note 

But to write in this way to the aunt of the girl whom one wants 
to forget was not the best means of ensuring that result Nor was it 
better to discuss lost love with her A small novel called The Lost 
Love had just been published and was very popular, and Max 
Muller sent it to Miss Grenfell, who read a personal note in it He 
replied at once, not unwilling to discuss the subject 

You cannot possibly allude to me when you say in your last letter 
speaking of a little book I sent you, that you hope there are not many 
such cases 1 But is there such a thing as a lost love ^ I do not believe 
it Nothing that is true and good is ever lost on earth though its fulfil- 
ment may be deferred beyond this short life Marriage is meant for this 
life only, but love is eternal, and all the more so, if it does meet with its 
fulfilment on earth. 

Max Muller did not take long to pass from the general to the 
concrete and in doing so wrote as the typical disinterested lover: 


As long as I imagined that the happiness of your dear niece depended

on her marriage with one so unworthy of her as myself, I sometimes 
feared that my mind would break down under the burden which God 
had placed on me As it is now, I feel relieved, because I know that she 
is happy and there may yet be greater happiness in store for her than 
she could have found as the wife of a poor man 

He even thought that Kingsley was wrong in assuring him that 
Georgina still loved him, as he wrote ‘Though Mr Kingsley no 
doubt meant very well in all he did, it was a mistake of his to 
imagine that it could be any consolation to me to be told that your 
mece, although she wished everything to be over, still entertained 
her deep affection This ought not to be It is different with a man 
whose heart is strong, and who can shape his life as he likes ’ 

After that the formal gesture of renunciation was bound to come, 
and it did in a postscript to this very letter, in which Muller wrote 
‘Whenever you write to me again please to tell me distinctly that you 
have burnt all my letters I know they are safe with you, but those 
eyes for which alone they were written may be closed by the hand 
of God, and there is something sacred in the intimacy of friendship 
that ought to be protected against profane eyes 5 

In his very next letter, written nine days later, he informs Miss 
Grenfell ‘I have just burnt the last letters which I had kept — it was 
painful to read then again for the last time ’ But he is not sure that 
Miss Grenfell has done the same thing 

Miss Grenfell had certainly left the subject intentionally vague, 
having her own mind about the matter, and that has enabled me to 
document this part of Muller’s biography Muller convinced himself 
that he had found a compensation He wrote to Miss Grenfell ‘I 
hope you will some day come to All Souls and see me in my little 
cell I think you would agree with me that one may be very happy 
here — perhaps too happy I have found a home, a very pleasant 
home, as you will see when you come to Oxford 5 This exchange of 
letters continued She never withdrew her sympathy and good will 
from him, and Max Muller never ceased to be grateful Perhaps he 
would have been still more grateful if he had known that at one 
stage she had come forward with an offer to remove the money 
difficulty out of her own income There is no doubt that even if the 
marriage had not taken place Miss Grenfell would never have 
ceased to hold her place in his heart 

But it was neither Georgina’s love nor her faith which was to 
bring about her own and Muller’s release from suffering It was her

body which did that at last, by failing to bear the agony Some two 
months after she had set down her view of the tranquillizing effect 
of a loveless marriage, she saw Muller at a concert from a distance 
and fainted away Instead of feeling ashamed about this melo- 
dramatic weakness she gloried in it, and wrote in her diary as soon 
as she was strong enough to attend to it 

Last Thursday the 12th May I saw Muller at a concert It was agony 
I saw him come m, he only saw me at the end I always knew it would 
harrow up the very core of my heart whenever it happened and so it 
did So near, and yet so far off — no word, no sign between us, whose 
very souls cling so together Yet thank God it has happened, for it has 
undeceived myself and others, who fancied it was all over I have sub- 
mitted so quietly, so cheerfully to my father’s stern will that many 
think that the sacrifice was light Few know how my whole life’s joy is 
gone He looked well and at peace God grant that it may really be 
so and give me grace to trust on £ A little longer’ and he and I shall 
meet where none can part us 

But that was not to be The doctor who was called in said that 
Georgina’s will to live was gone, and she would just fade away Both 
Kingsley and Froude advised Riversdale Grenfell to give his con- 
sent, and the father, who had never paid any heed to the mental 
suffering of his daughter, was frightened by the failure of her body 
He gave his consent 

So the trials of both Max and Georgina were drawing to a close 
On June 8, 1859, when on her way to Ray Lodge from Scotland 
she had reached Lichfield, Miss Grenfell wrote to Max Muller, 
apparently resolved not to lose a minute to give him the happy news 

My dear friend, This day three years you were very sad, and so were 
others, but there is a great change in the aspect of your lives — and I am 
allowed by my Brother to say that you will be welcome at Ray Lodge 
agam, and that we shall expect you there on Saturday next — your long 
patience and submission to what was hard to bear is to be rewarded, 
and it seems to be all like a dream Perhaps you have heard of my 
Brother having been in Oxford, or may have seen him there He does 
not tell me if this is so — but in a letter just arrived he says he withdraws 
his objection to your union with his beloved Georgie, and now I may 
say that I hope and trust it will be the object of you both to contribute 
m every way to his happmess — for he is (I may say it to you without 
the fear of offending you) making a sacrifice of his own views and feel-

mgs in thus consenting to what he opposed so long But so it is — 
whatever has brought it about, and now my dear friend you have a 
great treasure to take care of Oh may you guide and help her in all 
that is good, and holy, and in a word Chnstianlike 

You know my regard and affection for you, but you do not know 
what a difficult path I have had to walk m, so as to be kind and yet up- 
right with everyone But all this is over now — May God realize all your 
happy expectations and give me the great blessing of seeing both these 
dear children happy for life Theodore and Charlotte are all joy Georgie 
is feeling rather stunned by the suddenness of the change After Satur- 
day we shall feel quieter Let me have a Ime to say what time you are 
likely to arrive We are here on our way home from Scotland, and little 
thought what was awaiting us May God bless you 

She adds in a postscript ‘Remember you will have to take some 
care of me in my old age.’ Max Muller got the letter on the 9th and 
replied immediately. 

My dear friend, Here I have been sitting for hours, but I cannot collect 
my thoughts, much less can I write them down You must have 
patience with me, but such a sudden burst of light dazzles my poor 
eyes, and I hardly dare to trust them when I look at your letter I can- 
not understand it, I did not see Mr Grenfell when he was at Oxford 
I knew of his being here, and I felt keenly that he evidently did not 
wish to see me In moments like these we must be alone, quite alone 
with God I shall be more collected when I see you on Saturday, today 
I feel broken down in mind and body Do you know that so much 
happiness is very hard to bear? Do help me to bear it by sharing it 
with me 1 

Then after signing his name he remembered that he had not told 
her the time of his arrival So he wrote a postscript like Miss 
Grenfell, but with a more immediate application ‘May I come by 
the tram that arrives at Maidenhead at 11 25 

On the same day after arriving at Ray Lodge, Georgina set down 
in her journal ‘ “Thou dost all things well*” Great joy given me 
God help me to bear it Papa removes his veto and Max and I meet 
the day after tomorrow “Tarry thou the Lord’s leisure, be strong 
and He shall comfort thine heart ,s * 

At 11 25 Max Muller was going to arrive at Maidenhead station. 
Georgina was sitting in her room expecting him and she set down

m her diary ‘June n, 114am — I am waiting for my great joy 
God give me grace to bear it rightly ’ 

The next entry for the same day 

Max arrived at 2, and then we were together, really together, and the 
long three years since he put me into the carnage at Oxford rolled 
away like a dark dream All the others were out, and we sat together 
under the ilex tree and began to know each other and see how those 
three years had taught us and fitted us for our life together, how even 
m absence our souls had grown together, and I thanked God for His 
great love and mercy and for giving me such a soul to love and live for, 
to call mine for time and eternity In the evening he played to me — 
those sounds I had never thought to hear again We walked round by 
the river and stood long together at the gate at the back How happy 1 

The next day, Sunday, Max Muller wrote to Kingsley 

My dear Kingsley, Can you believe it ? I cannot, though I see her with 
my eyes I knew not that the world contained such happiness You 
know her, you know what treasure she is You know also what we have 
suffered, and now think of us, and pray for us to God that He may help 
us and teach us how to bear such joy and blessmg You are not angry 
with me ? Do not let us think of the past, it was so dark and awful, and 
the world around us is so happy and bright, there must be no cloud 
anywhere We shall meet on Tuesday I long to see my new dear aunt, 
— my old dear friend, Mrs Kingsley Oh this world of God is full of 
wonders, but the greatest wonder of all wonders is Love 

On this letter there is a short note in Kingsley’s hand Tor 
Georgie 5 And without a doubt Georgie saw it 
The wedding was to take place on August 3, nearly seven weeks 
later But the days passed almost in a delirium of joy for both, talk- 
ing to each other, listening to Beethoven’s and Handel’s music, 
walking, attending church together, reading F, D Maurice and 
Keble and even the marriage service in advance I have already 
quoted some entries from Georgina Grenfell’s diary during this 
period which illustrate her ecstasy But I would still quote three 
typical ones The first of these describes how she took Max Muller 
to the grave of her long-dead mother at Taplow She writes T took 
him to my mother’s grave That fair young mother but little older 
than I am — could she but see us, she would be satisfied , Yes, that is 



BEATA GEORGINA 173 

the word — it is not mere bright happiness, but such entirely, 
utterly satisfied feeling This grows every day ’ 

The following entry was the last one before her wedding day 

Thursday 12 p in — Just in from the garden Oh* how happy we have 
been , sitting under our own ilex, and next time we are together it will 
be as husband and wife What solemn words, yet how blessed ‘Oh* 
God our Heavenly Father, Thou hast led us hitherto and ordered 
everything to this end Do thou still lead and guide us and enable us 
to offer ourselves our souls & bodies as a sacrifice to Thee, so that after 
training here on earth together, we may together dwell for ever with 
Thee, in a brighter world where nothmg changes or passes Amen ’ 

And on the morning of her wedding day she wrote ‘My wedding 
Day “Bless the Lord, oh my soul ” I go with perfect confidence 
and trust May God bless us both and may our lives be devoted to 
Him Amen*’ 

After the wedding at Bray Church the newly married couple 
spent a week at Eversley Rectory lent by Kingsley, and then they 
went on a Continental tour, meeting Bunsen at Heidelberg, Max 
Muller’s mother at Dresden, his sister at Chemnitz, and visiting 
Bohemia, Switzerland and western Germany on their way back to 
Oxford, which they reached on October 24 Two months later she 
set down the last entry in her diary about her love affair and 
marriage* 

Ray Lodge — X’mas Day, 1859 I have not written anything in this 
book in the last four bright months My life seemed too bright for 
words I am not disappointed Much as I had expected from my long- 
loved Max I had no idea of half his value I cannot express his deep 
love, his tenderness, his forbearance Our three months abroad were 
mdeed happy and there began the hope of even greater joy for the 
future and tho* God has destroyed that hope for a time, still intense 
happiness is showered on us Our joy is awful I can but pray that our 
good and gracious Father will bless our happy life now, to our real 
eternal good as I feel he did the years of sorrow that preceded it And 
here we are assembled, our whole party, well, bright, and with every 
blessing showered on us Gracious God, teach us all to remember 
Thee, as the author of all our blessings, and may we so pass through 
things temporal as finally to lose not the thmgs eternal Bless us for 
time and eternity 

How poor words seem How can they describe such joy as mine and 



174 SCHOLAR EXTRAORDINARY 

Max’s, how can they fitly express the hourly prayer, that I can truly 
say my grateful heart is always offering up, that we may both be God’s 
true servants and training together for an ever brighter higher life 
hereafter — ‘Thou God seest us ’ Thou dost know the thoughts, no 
need of our faltering words, when we approach Thee, our omniscient 
Father 

This fusion of human and divine love was one of the finest achieve- 
ments of the Christian civilization of Europe, and it resulted in an 
exultant mysticism of the sex relationship Both have become 
things of the past in the world in which they were once created But 
even when this kind of love was a force in the life of European men 
and women, it could hardly be expected to be found in the lives of a 
German specialist on Sanskrit and comparative philology and an 
English girl belonging to fashionable society Appraisal of personal 
life is always baffling, because one can never discover fully what 
happens in its hinterland 

At this point I must describe a by-product of Max Muller’s dis- 
appointment in love It was a short novel or long story in German 
to which he gave the title Deutsche Liebe , German Love He wrote it 
m the autumn of 1856 when his mother was with him at Oxford, 
and it was published anonymously by Brockhaus of Leipzig in 
February 1857 I* became very popular there, and before Max 
Muller’s death in 1900 went through twelve editions An English 
translation by one Miss Wmkworth was immediately published, and 
it was widely read There was also an unauthorized American trans- 
lation which was very free, but it sold in very large numbers 
Georgina Grenfell, who knew and spoke German very well even 
before her marriage with Muller, made her own translation but it 
was not published for twenty years Then it was allowed to supersede 
the older translation because Max Muller thought that his wife’s 
translation more nearly gave the exact tone and colouring of the 
original and was more literal It was also translated into many other 
European languages A pocket edition was issued as late as 1913. 

The book seems to have appealed to some deep-seated and uni- 
versal human mood and, as Mrs Max Muller wrote in 1909, it had 
been dearly loved by many in many lands Max Muller himself was 
particularly pleased that his novel had succeeded in winning friends 
among the hard-headed readers of the United States There is 
striking evidence of its appeal in a letter which he received from a 
total stranger in California in 1899, more than forty years after its 



BEATA GEORGINA 


175 


publication This American informed him that his wife had just 
died, and added ‘I want to tell you that your Deutsche Liebe lies 
upon her breast, in accordance with her wish I want to thank you 
on her behalf and my own, for that most beautiful story of spiritual 
affinity 9 

It is a story of love between a crippled German princess and a 
young commoner in a small German principality, and can be called 
a Ruritanian idyll except for its deep pathos I do not characterize 
the book as a tragedy because it is so instinct with the spirit of the 
Christian mystic and Quietist that no sense of any tragic catastrophe 
is created 

Max Muller himself explained why he had written it in a letter to 
Baron Bunsen 

What I wished to make clear to myself and others was, why with the 
inborn love to our fellow creatures, we could show that love to so very 
few of them only, why love had to be confined almost entirely to the 
members of our family, to our parents, our wife, our children, and 
why any attempt to go beyond generally ended in sorrow It is so, and 
we know not why, except again to show us that this life was not meant 
to be perfect, but only to give us by its very imperfections a faith in and 
a longing for a better life 

Froude in reviewing the book for the Saturday Review pointed 
out the historical position of this novel as another depiction of love 

One of our first impulses on seeing the general character of this work 
was to turn to the Bekenntnisse einer schonen Seele in Wilhem Meister , 
and to refresh our recollection of that remarkable production It was 
not without feelings of satisfaction that we laid down the volume of 
the great master and took up the one before us, reflecting how much 
half a century had done to elevate and purify the tone of society 

Max Muller himself had another contrast to Goethe in his mind 
To his mother, to whom he had not disclosed his authorship, he 
wrote ‘He [the author] only published the book because he thought 
that here and there it might do some good, and might cure young 
people of the epidemic of so-called unfortunate love The book con- 
tains the antidote to Werthers Leiden , and in so far is interesting 9 
But he also adds ‘But it ought to have been more fully worked out 
to have much influence 9 



176 SCHOLAR EXTRAORDINARY 

The anonymity of the book was preserved for three or four edi- 
tions, and then Muller came to be known as its author Bunsen was 
informed, and Fronde suspected the authorship 

The object of all this evasion seems to have been to avoid specu- 
lation as to whether the book contained a real personal story, and 
that story concerned the handsome young German don at Oxford 
But as soon as the fact of his authorship became known that was the 
very attribution which continued to be made So, in the preface to 
the sixth English edition published in 1898, Muller wrote T have 
received during the last forty years ever so many inquiries whether 
the book was autobiographical, and I have had to explain again and 
again that it was not, and why it was not I * * * 5 * * * He explained that it was 
only the idea of love with which he was concerned, and the story 
was no more than the frame in which it had to be set Love was a 
word, he added, ‘which has had many and often very conflicting 
meanings assigned to it, and which, I thought and still think, each 
man and woman has a right to define after his or her own heart 9 
Mrs Max Muller, too, in her biography of her husband published 
m 1902, set down a final contradiction ‘So much has been written 
and said about this prose idyll, so many people have declared it to 
be autobiographical, that it is perhaps well once for all to say that it 
is pure fiction as far as the characters and circumstances are con- 
cerned 5 One wonders whether as she was writing this she recalled 
what she herself had set down in her diary on May 31, 1857. 

I have read Deutsche Liebe and know who it is by [She had assumed as 

a matter of course that the story was autobiographical ] I cannot feel 

anything but pleasure that Max should have loved that pure holy 

Grafin — it is like having loved and been loved by an Angel, and I feel 

that the sort of love he had for her, cannot, has not, lessened his power 

of loving me How after intercourse with her he could see anything in 

me to attract, I cannot guess When I think of Maria [the Princess 

m the story] I quite shrink at thought of my own weakness and 

nothingness But I can never doubt Max’s real love to me!

To Max Muller the Rig-Veda , which kept him occupied fully or 
partly for thirty years, was only a means to an end Not that he ever 
underrated the value of the means, absolute or relative, on the 
contrary, he emphasized its importance so much that people might 
justifiably have thought of him as a man who was riding a hobby- 
horse Conscious of this, he again and again made out a case for 
studying the Rig-Veda Nevertheless, the establishment of its text 
and that of Sayana’s commentary, followed by an attempt to under- 
stand its meaning, was to him the preliminary investigation in a 
wider quest — the examination, in a particular field, of phenomena he 
was primarily interested in and wanted to understand In short, his 
work on the Rtg-Veda could be compared to the experiments carried 
out by a theoretical physicist or, better still, to the investigations 
of Darwin 

The cast of his mind was speculative, philosophical, or even 
metaphysical, and its natural inclination was towards generalization 
This grew stronger in him as he became older, and towards the end 
of his life he gave expression to his respect for generalization by 
quoting a sentence of Emerson and providing his own gloss on it 

Let us take such a sentence as ‘Generalization is always a new influx of 
divinity mto the mind — hence the thrill that attends’ To the ordinary 
reader such a sentence can convey very little , it might seem, in fact, a 
mere exaggeration But to those who know the long history of thought 
connected with the question of the ongm of conceptual thought as the 
result of ceaseless generalizations, Emerson’s words convey the out- 
come of profound thought They show that he had recognized in 
general ideas, which are to us merely the result of a never-ceasing syn- 
thesis, the origmal thoughts or logoi underlying the immense variety 
of created things, that he had traced them back to their only possible 
source, the Divme Mind, and that he saw how the human mind, by 
rising from particulars to the general, was in reality only approaching 
the source of those divme thoughts, and thus becommg conscious, as it 
were, of the influx of divinity

As was natural, this bent found its concentrated application in his 
basic intellectual interest — human thought, its origin and develop- 
ment Actually, as it progressed, his intellectual activity became 
more and more concerned with what I have called the prehistory of 
the human mind, on which he showed himself to be a pioneer This 
was pointed out in a French book, UOngin de la Pensee et de la 
Parole , published from Pans in 1900, a few months before his death 
and recommended by him in his autobiography ‘as giving a clear and 
complete abstract of my writings’ * 

The name of the author was given as in Moncalm, but it was the 
pseudonym for a woman, Madame de Wagner, who lived in Rome 
She wrote to him in 1895 asking permission to quote from his 
works in a book which she said was being written by a friend Leave 
was granted, and when passing through Rome in 1897 he met the 
lady, he found that she herself was the author When the book was 
sent to him after publication Muller was recovering from his severe 
illness of the previous year, and he could only write ‘Many thanks 
for your present Today I can only say, Brava f Brava f But I hope 
to say something more as soon as I can shake off my weakness ’ But 
he could not 

In the introduction Madame de Wagner said that till recently 
those who were interested in the origins of life or of man could 
hardly get beyond the account in the Bible, or imagine that there 
were documents to illustrate the unexplored regions of the physical 
and mental world which were much more ancient But, she went on 

Two enterprising men, Darwin and Max Muller, visited and studied 
them Darwin sought to explain what the origin of organic beings 
might have been, and in what way they passed through a series of evo- 
lutions, from one form to another of great dissimilarity The de- 
velopment of human reason has been one of the objects of Max 
Muller’s researches This great thinker, who is at the same time the 
first philologist of our time, has sought in the Science of Language for 
the origin of thinking man 

Here the whole connexion between Max Muller’s basic intellec- 
tual propensity and his philological work was indicated If his end 
was to understand the beginnings of mental activity in man, whose 
first notional products were about religion and! mythology, he had to

Thought and Speech (London, 1905)

179 


understand the emergence and employment of language at the very 
outset So his philological inquiries would have been another means 
to an end for him But, in actual fact, it was much more than that — a 
merging of his interest in thought as well as in language This was 
due to a theory of his which held that thought and language were 
inseparable and co-existent To use a theological phrase there was 
a consubstantiality between the two Ratio et Oratio , he said, were 
one, and he referred to the fact that the Greeks designated both by 
the same word, Logos Therefore, one is not surprised to find 
Muller saying ‘Language is the autobiography of the human 
mind * 

Max Muller’s conclusions about language will be summarized 
later in this chapter, but before this is done it is necessary to de- 
scribe his work on language in general I have already mentioned 
that his first public utterance was on a problem of language, when 
he appeared before the British Association for the Advancement of 
Science at its meeting at Oxford in 1847, and that foreshadowed his 
matured ideas about philology His next contribution was an article 
m the October 1851 issue of the Edinburgh Review It was nominally 
a review of the English translation by Lieutenant Eastwick of 
Franz Bopp’s Comparative Grammar , but it was also an essay sum- 
ming up the results achieved to date by the new science of Com- 
parative Philology Muller concluded the article with the words Tt 
may be seen from this single instance that Comparative Grammar 
addresses itself not only to the Grammarian, but to the Philosopher 
and the Historian also * He never forgot this comprehensive am- 
biance of philology in his treatment of language 

It was, however, as deputy and full Taylonan Professor of 
Modern European Languages that Max Muller developed his 
linguistic ideas over a number of years This professorship was in- 
tended not only to advance the study of the languages and their 
contents, but also to deal with them in the light of the new science 
of Comparative Philology Speaking as Tnthen’s substitute, he 
devoted his first lecture to the history and origins of modem Euro- 
pean languages His second lecture was on the Niebelunghed f and 
the third on the origins of the Romance languages These lectures 
foreshadowed the ideas which he finally embodied in two courses of 
lectures delivered in 1861 and 1863 on the science of language 

These roused not mere interest, but enthusiasm After reading 
the 1861 lectures when they were published in book form, Dean 



180 SCHOLAR EXTRAORDINARY 

Liddell wrote to Muller on November 16 , x 86 i Tt is humiliating 
to learn that the lectures have been delivered to the heedless ears 
of Oxford hearers 5 He was unfair to Max Muller’s audience, for the 
hearers, so far from being heedless, remembered their thrill even as 
old men Cowell, who went to Calcutta as principal of the Sanskrit 
College and afterwards became Professor of Sanskrit at Cambridge, 
was then an undergraduate He wrote: ‘The lecture was a written 
one, and was delivered to a large and attentive audience, and to 
most of those present, as well as myself, it was an introduction to 
the new world of Comparative Philology It was the first of a series of 
such lectures, all of which I attended ’ 

Tuckwell, author of a volume of delightful Oxford reminiscences, 
also went to the lectures with Dr (afterwards Sir Thomas) Acland, 
the physician Acland, he said, was disturbed, fidgeted, bit his nails, 
and remarked ‘It frightens one*’ Tuckwell wrote that these lectures 
taught him the novel doctrine of Aryan migrations, and the rationale 
of Greek myths Story-Maskelyne, another Oxford figure and Pro- 
fessor of Mineralogy, also attended, and after Muller’s death 
described the impression the lectures had made on him fifty years 
before 

Well do I remember his lectures It was a new star in the Oxford 
firmament I do not think any Oxford man — unless it was Church 
of Oriel [afterwards Dean of St Paul’s] — could have given such a 
course of lectures It was a new light, a new idea of literature and lec- 
ture, that Max imported mto the grey old walls of beautiful Oxford 

Story-Maskelyne added that Philip Pusey, son of the great 
Doctor, rode over with his boy-son all the way from his place near 
Faringdon sixteen miles away to hear each lecture* c An early 
homage to the rising fame of the redactor of the Rig-Veda ’ Finally 
Story-Maskelyne wrote 

Natural science was not in high vogue then at Oxford, but the leaves 
on the trees were beginning to stir, so that when Max proclaimed his 
thesis that Comparative Philology and the historical development of 
f language should rank with the Natural Sciences, there was a little rustle 
! of scepticism, though in fact he was anticipating the assertion of evo- 
lution being the key to Natural Science 

Max Muller’s next philological excursion was an essay on the

Turanian languages contributed to Bunsen’s Christianity and Man- 
kind , and published in 1854, though written almost entirely in 1853 
This led to a controversy with Renan, which to the credit of both 
was ended quickly Renan found Muller’s views unacceptable, and 
in his Histoire generate des longue semitiques , published in 1855, 
made a sharp attack on Muller’s views on the Turanian languages 

Muller became very angry, and wrote a long and fierce review of 
Renan’s book and had it printed as a pamphlet Renan then wrote 
to Muller ‘Pardonnez-moi, je n’ai pas compns ce que vous vouhez 
dire * Upon this Muller suppressed the pamphlet, though its print- 
ing must have cost him some money, and afterwards he and Renan 
became intimate friends Later in his life Muller gave up all the 
views on the Turanian languages expressed in the essay, as they 
were disproved by subsequent researches 

In carrying on his linguistic studies and researches for their own 
sake, Max Muller never forgot that they had a bearing on practical 
affairs So it is not surprising to find him drawn, as soon as his 
standing as a linguist became known, into linguistic discussions 
arising out of cultural, administrative and even military activities 

In March 1853 the Crimean War began and, as the British army 
despatched there had to be familiar with the languages of the region. 
Sir Charles Trevelyan asked Muller for information about the 
languages of the northern part of the Turkish Empire and the 
adjoining Russian provinces, with which the officers serving in 
the war should become acquainted Max Muller at once wrote a 
long pamphlet on Languages of the Seat of War The comer of 
Europe from north Italy to the Danube, he said, was a real linguistic 
rookery, in which all the lost daughters of the European family of 
languages had taken refuge This book needed a second edition in a 
year 

At the end of 1854 Macaulay invited Max Muller to his rooms in 
the Albany to discuss with him the new regulations for the Indian 
Civil Service, so far as they related to the teaching of Oriental sub- 
jects and languages During his membership of the Council of the 
Governor-General of India twenty years before, Macaulay had 
shown himself to be the most vigorous and effectual supporter of 
English as the medium for the education of Indians, and had 
imposed his views on the Indian Government It was also well 
known that he was no admirer of Oriental learning and literature. 
But Muller thought that he would perhaps be open to conversion, 



182 SCHOLAR EXTRAORDINARY 

and went to the great man armed with facts and arguments to 
counter Macaulay’s As he wrote in his autobiography at the end 
of his life, he went back to Oxford a sadder, and — he hoped — a 
wiser man, for Macaulay never gave him a chance to put in a word 
Macaulay said that he knew nothing of Indian languages and 
literature, and wanted to know all that Muller had to say about the 
advantages to be derived by young civilians from a study of San- 
skrit He put some questions, but before Muller had a chance to 
answer any one of them, he began to relate his experiences in India, 
ending up with the usual diatribes against the natives of India on 
the score of their untruthfulness and untrustworthmess in a court 
of law 

Muller soon engaged himself in another linguistic campaign 
which was more ambitious, and which he sustained in one form or 
another throughout his life It was for establishing schools for the 
study of Oriental languages, either in the universities or as inde- 
pendent public institutions He had written about it to Sir Charles 
Trevelyan at the time of the Crimean War, when sending his report 
on Languages of the Seat of War In it he pointed out the connexion 
between the political role of England in India and a competent 
knowledge of Oriental languages 

It is undoubtedly high time [he wrote] that something should be done 
to encourage the study of Oriental languages in England In all 
other countries which have any political, commercial, and religious 
connexion with the East, provision has been made, by Government or 
otherwise, to encourage young men to devote themselves to this 
branch of studies Russia has always been a most liberal patron of 
Oriental philology The French Government has founded a school 
At Vienna there is an Oriental seminary Prussia finds it expedient to 
give encouragement to young Oriental scholars, employed afterwards 
with advantage as consuls and interpreters In England alone, where 
the most vital mterests are involved in a free intercourse with the East, 
hardly anything is done to foster Oriental studies 

The Indian Mutiny of 1857 filled Muller with an even greater 
sense of urgency in pressing the matter on the public and the 
government At the end of the year this thread was taken up, and 
there began the publication of a series of letters discussing the lin- 
guistic aspect of the Mutiny and making proposals for establishing 
a school for the study of Oriental languages The first letter which

had the heading, On the Neglect of the Study of the Indian Lan- 
guages considered as a Cause of the Indian Rebellion , was dated De- 
cember 30, and was written by Max Muller under the name of 
Phihndus The point he made was that it was the ignorance of the 
language of northern India which prevented the officers of the East 
India Company, who were taken completely by surprise by the 
rebellion, from having any real intercourse with the natives, and it 
was the same ignorance which created a feeling of estrangement, 
mistrust and contempt on both sides He observed that ‘a man need 
not have been in India to see that in order to govern a people, and 
to gam the confidence and goodwill of a conquered race, it is neces- 
sary to know their language’, and then he put forward the operative 
part of his argument 

It ought to be, and no doubt will be, one of the first things for Parlia- 
ment to declare that a study of the native dialects shall be obligatory 
on every candidate for the Indian civil and military services In the 
examinations for India it will be the duty of Government to 
provide candidates with the means of learnmg the Indian languages 
m this country, by establishing an Oriental college 

This letter was followed by six others, two from Max Muller 
writing as Philmdus, two from Sir Charles Trevelyan, one from 
Professor Momer Williams of the East India College of Haileybury 
and one from an Indian Muslim, Professor Syed Abdoolah 

In his advocacy of Indian languages Max Muller naturally 
stressed the importance of Sanskrit as well One part of his reasoning, 
as set forth in his letter of January 4, 1858, is worth quoting 

But there are other considerations of a more subtle nature perhaps 
[he wrote], yet of considerable weight for making an elementary 
knowledge of Sanskrit an essential part of a civilian’s previous educa- 
tion in England It has been said that Sanskrit is a dead language, but, 
although Sanskrit is no longer spoken by the people, it is still the very 
life-spring of their thoughts, their faith, their feelings, and prejudices 
In most countries the spoken language would at once be the key to the 
literature, and thiough it to the social, moral, and religious character 
of a nation It is not so in India There the state of literature at the 
present day is about the same as that of Italy at, or rather before, the 
time of Dante The spoken language, tl volgare , is Hindustani, Bengali, 
or Guzerathi , but the language of literature, law, and religion is still the 
classical Sanskrit

He also expressed a definite view as to the method which should 
be adopted to teach Sanskrit to young civilians He wrote 

To learn Sanskrit from a pandit in India, according to the native 
system of grammar, must be a most tedious process , and this is the very 
reason why this part of a civilian’s education should be finished in 
England with the assistance of grammars, dictionaries, and reading 
books, composed on a more rational system than the grammar of Panim, 
the Mahabhashya, and the Amara-kosha 

But nothing was done at that time, though Prince Albert took a 
lively interest in the scheme after the publication of the letters in 
The Times The Prmce saw clearly the disadvantage for England of 
not having such an institution, and spoke to Lord Granville, the 
Foreign Secretary, who wrote to Muller asking him to make further 
proposals This Muller did, but he would not go further, because 
at that time there was such a feeling against Germans that the 
association of the name of Prmce Albert and of a German scholar 
with the scheme would have been enough to wreck it 

More than thirty years later the idea was again taken up, and 
then successfully A School of Modern Oriental Studies was estab- 
lished by the Imperial Institute in co-operation with University 
College and King’s College, London, and Max Muller was asked to 
deliver the inaugural address He did so on January 14, 1890, at the 
Royal Institution, with the Prmce of Wales in the chair He recalled 
his plea for teaching Oriental languages and said that it had fallen 
on deaf ears. When imperial interests were at stake, he declared, the 
country had a right to expect imperial, that is, concentrated action, 
such as had been taken in Russia, France, Austria and Germany 
He dwelt on the commercial and political importance of the lan- 
guages, and also explained how the task of governing India would 
be simplified if the governing race were able, by knowledge of their 
languages, to enter more readily into the thoughts, lives and aspira- 
tions of those they governed The newspapers took up the subject 
warmly, but Muller heard from the Chairman of the Committee of 
Management that there was little prospect of getting any assistance 
from the government, and in fact the government did not contribute 
anything to the maintenance of the School established by the 
Imperial Institute. 

Though Max Muller was writing and speaking on languages for 
many years, he did not make his formal appearance as a Compara-

tive Philologist until 1861 In April of that year he began a course of 
lectures at the Royal Institution in London, which, followed by a 
second series in 1863, established him as the foremost authority on 
philology in Bntam The original lectures were published under the 
title of Lectures on the Science of Language , and the book was his 
second full-length contribution to scholarship 

Before the lectures Muller was very nervous at the prospect of 
having to address a select audience of not only the intellectual but 
also the social elite of London Among the distinguished hearers 
were the Duke of Argyll, Connop Thirwall, Milman, Stanley, 
F D Maurice, Faraday and John Stuart Mill As the lectures pro- 
ceeded the lecture-room became more and more crowded and Albe- 
marle Street more and more blocked by the fine carriages of people 
who came to hear about Aryan roots, Aryan ancestors and the 
common Aryan home in Asia 

'It is,’ said a contemporary notice, 'a fact of no ordinary signi- 
ficance that, in the height of the London season, an enthusiastic 
audience of both sexes crowded the benches and endured the heat of 
a popular lecture-room, not to witness the brilliant experiments, or 
be fascinated by the revelations of a Faraday or an Owen, but to 
listen to a philosophical exposition of the inner mysteries of 
language ’ Max Muller’s reputation now had a solid aspect, which 
was fully proved when the lectures came out in book form By 1886, 
that is, in twenty-five years, fourteen editions were printed 

The second course of lectures was delivered by Muller from 
February to May 1863 There were twelve in this series, and they 
were more technical than the first lectures They were even better 
attended than the first ones, and were published in book form in the 
middle of 1864 Before that Muller was invited to Osborne House on 
the Isle of Wight, where Queen Victoria was residing, to speak on 
language before the royal family and suite He gave the lectures in 
January in the Council Chamber, and for the first one the entire 
company were assembled, except the Queen and her children After 
a while they too came in The Queen had not attended a lecture for 
more than ten years Max Muller proudly reported to his wife. 'She 
[the Queen] listened very attentively, and did not knit at all, though 
her work was brought ’ He was informed by the Queen’s Private 
Secretary how pleased she was with the lectures 

Three more expositions of Comparative Philology given by 
Muller in the next few years have to be noted in this chapter The 



186 SCHOLAR EXTRAORDINARY 

first of these was the Rede Lecture at Cambridge in 1868 He was 
mvited in January to deliver it, and at the end of May went with 
his wife to Cambridge It was proposed to confer the degree of LL D 
on him on this occasion, and also on the Arabic scholar Dr Wright 
and the American hydrographer Commodore Maury 

He delivered the lecture, which was entitled On the Stratification 
of Language , on May 29 The mam thesis was the idea that in 
philology, as in geology, there were stratifications which, though 
forming a chronological series, were exposed to simultaneous ob- 
servation in their distribution, and thus enabled philologists to 
deduce the early development of language from the isolating stage 
to the agglutinative, and again from the agglutinative to the 
inflective 

Muller’s next address was his inaugural lecture after being 
appointed to the chair of Comparative Philology created expressly 
for him at Oxford, and this was delivered on October 27, 1868 His 
third was also an inaugural lecture, delivered on May 23, 1872, 
before the Imperial University of Strassburg created after Alsace had 
become part of the German Empire 

By that time, largely through Muller’s own writings and speeches, 
the claims and value of the science of Comparative Philology had 
been established and its far-ranging importance recognized To 
sum up the stage reached at that date in the words Muller himself 
used in his Strassburg address ‘This short survey must suffice to 
show you how omnipresent the Science of Language has become in 
all spheres of human knowledge, and how far its limits have been 
extended, so that it often seems impossible for one man to embrace 
the whole of its vast domain ’ Henceforward Muller’s purely philo- 
logical interests were never merely linguistic, on the one hand they 
merged in his wider interest in the origin and nature of thought, 
mythology and religion, and on the other involved him in some very 
acrimonious controversy Therefore 1872 is a convenient date at 
which to summarize Muller’s purely linguistic ideas and define his 
role as a philologist 

In the most popular and easily recognized aspect of his activity 
as such, Max Muller is comparable to two of his famous contem- 
poraries, T. H. Huxley and Matthew Arnold Just as Huxley 
carried on propaganda for evolution and Arnold for criticism, 
Muller also preached the cause of philology for its indispensability 
to the mental effort summed up in the age-old saying Know thy-

self His skill in presenting ideas and success in the propaganda into 
which he put his heart, were shown by the number and quality of the 
audiences he attracted This power to interest and hold attention 
even for the most abstruse matters he retained till the end of his life 
When he delivered the first course of his Gifford Lectures in 
Glasgow in November 1889, it was followed by all the distinguished 
Scottish intellectuals in the city Principal Caird attended the lec- 
tures, as did Dr Dickson, the Divinity Professor and Professor 
Edward Caird Most significant of all, it was the undergraduates 
who paid unqualified tribute to Muller’s power of holding attention 
Describing their attendance, a Glasgow paper wrote 

Your university student is generally thought to be a very rowdy indi- 
vidual, and yet it must be confessed that no one listens to a good lecture 
with closer attention than he The whistling of Two Lovely Black Eyes 
by the students of Glasgow University did not promise well for the 
attention Professor Max Muller would receive in delivering the first 
of his Gifford Lectures in the Bute Hall on Wednesday, but when the 
famous scholar plunged into his subject he could not have wished for 
a more attentive audience 

From the 1,400 on the first day, Muller’s audience settled down 
to a steady 1,000 throughout the course, which compared with the 
fifty an Oxford professor could get as a fair number, spoke well not 
only for Muller but also for the Scots 
Muller appealed also to people in whom one would not assume 
the existence of any active intellectual interest For instance, as a 
man in the Cab Office, Edinburgh, wrote to him. T am all the 
poorer today in that I missed hearing you when you were lecturing 
m Edinburgh, but I shall deem it a misfortune indeed if I am not 
present at your concluding lecture ’ On a previous occasion, when 
travelling with his whole family from South Wales, he was greatly 
helped by the guard, and he offered him a tip. But the guard said 
‘Oh, sir, would you send me instead one of your books ? I have read 
some of them ’ 

This appeal was created by Max Muller in the first instance by the 
clarity of his style He was an admirer of clear writing, and he tried 
to be as clear as possible himself In 1861 he wrote to Renan ‘There 
is that charm about your views and opinions, that they are carved 
out of marble and not out of plaster . I cannot help thinking that 
there is nothing that cannot be made clear, and bright, and simple, 



188 SCHOLAR EXTRAORDINARY 

and that obscurity arises in all cases from slovenly thinking and lazy 
writing J 

In advising Tame how to speak when he was invited to lecture at 
Oxford in 1871, he wrote 

Oxford is an extremely difficult place to lecture m, because all audiences 
are very mixed It is difficult to hit where there are so many targets 
I should lecture as if I were addressing a highly educated lady, not 
ta kin g much for granted, making everything clear by a full statement 
of facts, but then drawing out the very best lessons that the facts will 
yield 

This in a nutshell was a complete theory of employing language 
to communicate ideas, but not one expected from a philologist 
There was general recognition of the skill which Muller displayed in 
presenting his ideas For instance, in the obituary published the 
day after his death, The Times wrote . 

Some contemporaries questioned the accuracy of his verbal scholar- 
ship No one could question his gifts as a man of letters Renan and 
Darmesteter — to mention two Oriental scholars — writing in their own 
tongues, were perhaps greater masters of making Science speak grace- 
fully, but in lucidity of arranging the most imposing matters, in power 
of generalization, in a certain large charity of spirit he had no superior 

This, however, lowered Muller in the eyes of specialists and 
academic scholars, among whom there is a deep suspicion of both 
popular fame and clarity of literary style Bergson was called ‘a 
philosopher of the drawing-rooms’ on account of this by the German 
admirers of Rudolph Eucken 

But no writer can be effective, that is to say, proselytize others 
with his ideas by being only a stylist In fact, he cannot even acquire 
style, for style is the man himself, and the man himself has to 
possess the charity of which The Times spoke, which is the same 
charity of which St Paul spoke. Not only great thoughts, but also 
the power to preach thoughts, come from the heart It was by 
speaking from his heart that Max Muller touched the hearts of his 
hearers and readers Mere scholarship would not have given him 
that power. He was very eloquent in expounding even dry linguistic 
ideas That came from his faith in his ideas He publicly stated his 
credo in the concluding words of his address at Strassburg, from 
which I shall quote the passage in which he himself cited Niebuhr: 



LANGUAGE 


189 


Allow me in conclusion, to recall to your remembrance another 
passage from Niebuhr He belongs to the good old race of German 
scholars ‘Above all things/ he writes, ‘we must in all scientific pur- 
suits preserve our truthfulness so pure that we thoroughly eschew 
every false appearance , that we represent not even the smallest thing 
as certain of which we are not completely convinced, that if we have 
to propose a conjecture, we spare no effort in representing the exact 
degree of its probability If we do not ourselves, when it is possible, 
indicate our errors, even such as no one else is likely to discover, if, in 
laying down our pen, we cannot say in the sight of God, upon strict 
examination, I have knowingly written nothing that is not true , and if 
without deceiving either ourselves or others, we have not presented 
even our most odious opponents in such a light only that we could 
justify it upon our death-beds — if we cannot do this, study and litera- 
ture serve only to make us unrighteous and sinful ’ 

‘All of us/ Max Muller added, ‘young as well as old, should keep 
these words before our eyes and in our hearts Thus and thus only, 
will our studies not miss their highest goal thus and thus only, may 
we hope to become true etymologists — i e , true lovers, seekers, and, 
[ trust, finders of truth ’ Throughout his life, both in writing and in 
dealing with other scholars, he followed these principles. 

Turning now to Max Muller’s views and theories about language, 
Lt is not easy to give a brief summary of them, for they had a very 
wide range, covering everything concerning language from a 
methodology to study it to what might be called its metaphysics. 
Besides, he went on re-stating them in the light of the work of other 
philologists and their criticism of his own work, which was very 
vocal However, as he never abandoned any position though he 
amplified or explained it in different words, it is not necessary to 
take a historical view of his linguistic work 
From the very first he maintained that the science of language 
was one of the physical (or natural) sciences This was the theme 
3f his first lecture in 1861, and in later life he became involved in 
some very unpleasant controversy over this But in thinking of his 
Dwn subject in this way he did not have in mind the distinction 
Detween philosophy and science which was a matter of discussion 
r or many philosophical writers This distinction hardly existed for 
mm, for he passed quite naturally from a strictly scientific study of 
anguage to sweeping philosophical speculations about its nature 
md origin 



190 SCHOLAR EXTRAORDINARY 

The distinction which he kept in view when he called linguistics 
one of the physical sciences was a different one, and in his view 
more basic This was the distinction which, according to him, 
existed between the physical or natural sciences and the historical 
or moral sciences The former, he said, dealt with the creations of 
God (by which he meant what we would call creations of Nature) 
and the latter with the creations of man, such as his tools, crafts, 
arts or literature In support of this view he first of all pointed out 
that the science of language had developed in three stages, as all the 
physical sciences had These were, first, the empirical stage con- 
cerned with the collection and examination of facts, then the classi- 
ficatory stage in which the inter-relation of the facts was studied, 
and the third was the theoretical stage, which he also called the 
metaphysical, in which the student searched for the origin and 
meaning of all the facts which the classificatory stage had shown to 
belong to one or many systems In the development of all the physi- 
cal sciences these stages followed one another in a chronological 
order, except for rare departures from the sequence The science of 
language, too, was developing in that order 

But, basically, his concept of the science of language was the 
product of a concept of the nature of language, and not merely 
derived from methodology He could not regard language as a 
creation of man, and went even further in holding that man could 
not modify language by an exercise of conscious will He put that 
view quite strongly 

Although there is a continuous change in language, it is not in the 
power of man either to produce or to prevent it We might think as 
well of changing the laws which control circulation of our blood, or of 
adding an inch to our height, as of altering the laws of speech, or in- 
venting new words according to our pleasure As man is the lord of 
nature only if he knows her laws and submits to them, the poet and the 
philosopher become the lords of language only if they know its laws 
and obey them 

Max Muller had to emphasize the powerlessness of the human 
will in respect of language in order to counteract the theological 
view derived from the Book of Genesis, which was still current in 
his time Perhaps the idea has to be kept in mind today too, on 
account of the growing habit of using language very carelessly All 
illiterate ages and men look upon grammar as a tyrannical imposition

on language, instead of regarding it as the anatomy and physiology 
of language which can be discovered but not invented by man 
But of course Muller was perfectly aware that language was not 
wholly a natural production, and that the conception of it as a 
natural phenomenon had to be qualified by recognizing that it also 
arose from the human mind, both in its conscious and unconscious 
workings The role of the human mind in shaping language he 
defined in the second edition of his lectures on The Science of 
Language published in 1862, in the following words: 

The process through which language is settled and unsettled, combines 
m one the two opposite elements of necessity and free-will Though the 
individual seems to be the prime mover in producing new words and 
new grammatical forms, he is so only after his individuality has been 
merged in the common action of the family, tribe, or nation to which he 
belongs He can do nothing by himself, and the first impulse to a new 
formation in language, though given by an individual , is mostly given 
without premeditation, nay, unconsciously The individual as such is 
powerless, and the results apparently produced by him, depend on 
laws beyond his control, and on the co-operation of all those who form 
together with him one class, one body, or one organic whole But 
though it is easy to show that language cannot be changed or moulded 
by the taste, the fancy, or genius of man, it is nevertheless through the 
instrumentality of man alone that language can be changed 

Language, he said by way of summing up the case he was making, 
reflects the double nature of man, half animal and half a sentient 
being ‘With one foot language stands, no doubt, in the realm of 
nature, but with the other in the realm of the spirit * This naturally 
led him to raise the question which he himself put in these words 
‘Every language has to be learnt, but who made the language that 
was to be learnt ^ But this question, he said, could not be answered 
by simply recounting its history, for that history did not seem to 
have any beginning 

The history of language [he wrote] opens a vista which makes one feel 
almost giddy if one tries to see the end of it, but the measurmg-rod of 
the chronologist seems to me entirely out of place Those who have 
eyes to see will see the immeasurable distance between the first his- 
torical appearance of language and the real beginnings of human speech 
those who cannot see will oscillate between the wildly large figures of 
the Buddhists or the wildly small figures of the Rabbis, but they will 
never lay hold of what by its very nature is indefinite 



192 SCHOLAR EXTRAORDINARY 

Max Muller stated quite definitely that there was no means of 
solving the problem of language historically , that is to say, by de- 
scribing what happened in a certain locality and at a certain time, 
because history did not begin till long after mankind had acquired 
language Nothing, he declared, would be more interesting than to 
be able to say from historical records by what exact process man 
began to use words, and to be rid for ever of all the theories about 
the origin of language But this knowledge was denied to historians 
and scientists Indeed, the problem appeared so insoluble in his 
time that the Societe de Linguistique of Paris, founded shortly before 
he delivered his first lectures and composed of the most distin- 
guished scholars of France, laid down in its rules that it would 
not receive any communication on the question of the origin of 
languages 

However, there was a second-best If nobody could trace the 
events through which any language was produced, perhaps it might 
not be impossible to infer the process through which languages 
might have been formed This, it may be recalled, was what Darwin 
sought to do about the origin of species, because in his time the 
palaeontological evidence of the appearance of animals in a sequence 
of more and more complex forms was not exhaustive, and even if it 
were it would not have established evolution, but only the appearance 
of species at successive points of time, which might have been 
particular creations without being simultaneous Darwin was there- 
fore more concerned with the process by means of which evolution 
might have taken place, than with merely establishing evolution as 
the successive appearance of animals of different species on earth. 
Max Muller also applied himself to lay bare the linguistic processes, 
including both structural and functional changes. 

What, however, he could not accept, even after considering 
linguistic processes exhaustively, was an extension of the Dar- 
winian theory of evolution to the origin of language. Although he 
was ready to admit the evolution of man from pre-existmg species in 
his bodily attributes, he could not do so in regard to language This 
puzzled the Duke of Argyll, who wrote to him on February 2, 1872. 
Tn fact, I am quite unable to understand why you oppose Darwin- 
ism so much as applied to language — when your views as to religion 
seem to me essentially Darwinian ’ Muller replied to this question 
on the 4th 



LANGUAGE

Where I differ from Darwin is when he does not see that nothing can 
become actual but what was potential , that mere environment explains 
nothing, because what surrounds and determines is as much given as 
what is surrounded and determined , that both presuppose each other 
and are meant for each other Now I take my stand against Darwin 
on language, because language is the necessary condition of every other 
mental activity, religion not excluded, and I am able to prove that this 
indispensable condition of all mental growth is entirely absent in 
animals This is my palpable argument 

There is, however, another argument, based on the nature of all 
known languages, viz , that they presuppose the faculty of numbering, 
an argument somewhat Pythagorean, but not therefore the less true 
Even if it could be proved that man was the lineal descendant of an 
ape, that would not upset my argument The ape who could become 
the ancestor of man, would be a totally different bemg from the ape 
that remained for ever the ancestor of apes That ape would be simply 
an embryonic man, and we have no ground to be very proud of our 
own embryonic phases 

He said that nobody could doubt that certain animals possess all 
the physical requirements of articulate speech For instance, there 
was no letter of the alphabet which a parrot would not learn to 
pronounce Therefore the fact that the parrot was without a language 
of its own had to be explained by a difference between the mental 
and not the physical faculties of animals and men Next, the higher 
animals had a share of the mental faculties of man Nobody, he 
said, could dispute that the higher animals had sensation, perception, 
memory , will and also intellect if it was restricted to the correlation 
of single perceptions What then, he asked, was the fundamental 
difference between man and the brute world ? He answered with- 
out hesitation £ The one great barrier between the brute and man is 
Language Man speaks, and no brute has ever uttered a word 
Language is our Rubicon, and no brute will dare to cross it 5 
He went on repeating this idea, and the impossibility of man’s 
ever developing his faculty of speech from the animal stage by any 
process of natural selection similar to the mode of creation of species 
assumed by the Darwinian theory of evolution, and most emphati- 
cally he did so in his book The Science of Thought , published in 
1887 

By no effort of understanding, by no stretch of imagination, can I 
explain to myself how language could have grown out of anything 



194 SCHOLAR EXTRAORDINARY 

which animals possess, even if we granted them millions of years for 
that purpose If anything has a right to the name of specific difference, 
it is language, as we find it in man, and in man only Even if we re- 
moved the name of specific difference from our philosophic diction- 
aries, I should still hold that nothing deserves the name of man except 
what is able to speak 

Of course, Max Muller was thinking of evolution in terms of 
Darwin’s natural selection, when the idea of mutation had not been 
advanced and anything like creative evolution as distinct from 
adaptive evolution had not been thought of 

Max Muller took the view that the results of the science of lan- 
guage did not tally with the results of evolutionism up to his time, 
and words could not be derived directly from the imitative and 
emotive sounds made by animals A barrier had been raised be- 
tween the two kinds of sounds by the very nature of the symbolic 
sounds to which the science of language had traced back the origins 
of true language, and which the philologists called roots These 
roots, from which with certain exceptions all words were derived, 
were expressions of general concepts, and unless animals were 
capable of airivmg at general concepts language could only have 
originated with man On this point Muller argued as follows* 

We do not know anything and cannot possibly know anything of the 
mind of animals therefore, the proper attitude of the philosopher with 
regard to the mental capacities of animals is one of complete neutrality 
For all we know, the mental capacities of animals may be of a higher 
order than our own, as their sensuous capacities certainly are in many 
cases All this, however, is guesswork, one thing only is certain If we 
are right that man realizes his conceptual thought by means of words, 
derived from roots, and that no animal possesses words derived from 
roots, it follows, not indeed that animals have no conceptual thought, 
but that their conceptual thought is different in its realized shape from 
our own 

Taking this position, Max Muller was bound to hold that the 
origin of language and the origin of thought were coeval and con- 
nected, though it was impossible to ascertain when they came into 
existence What was fully established in his view was that the two 
were inseparable He could conceive of a stage of human develop- 
ment when man had neither language nor thought, but he could not 
admit that one of these could exist without the other. In all his 



LANGUAGE 


195 


pronouncements and writings he repeated the idea In the second 
course of lectures on The Science of Language, delivered in 1863, he 
said that ‘to treat of sound as independent of meaning, of thought as 
independent of words, seems to defy one of the best principles of 
the science of language' 

In his very much later book (1887), in which he tried to under- 
stand thought and its processes for himself rather than for others, 
and to which he gave the title Science of Thought , he put the argu- 
ment for taking language and thought as being inseparable much 
more strongly ‘It is possible/ he said, ‘to distinguish in our know- 
ledge four things Sensations ( Empfindungen ), Percepts (Vorstel- 
lungen). Concepts (Begnffe) and names ( Namen ) But though we 
can distinguish them, we must not imagine that these four ever 
exist as separate entities No words are possible without concepts, 
no concepts without percepts, no percepts without sensations * 
Since sensations preceded the other three, he was ready to admit as 
a matter of argument that they could exist independently of the 
others But as a matter of fact, he said, thought was utterly impos- 
sible without the simultaneous working of sensation, percepts, 
concepts and names, and in reality the four were inseparable 
In a letter to the Duke of Argyll, written on April 14, 1888, he 
explained his position in a less formal manner. 

It requires an effort to see the mseparableness of language and thought 
It has taken me a whole life to perceive it People imagine that I hold 
that language and thought are identical There is no sense in that No 
two things can be identical But they can be inseparable — neither can 
exist without the other, that is what I mean We imagine that we can 
think without words, because we can distinguish between the sound 
and the meaning So we can between an orange and its skm, but in 
rerum natura there is no skm without an orange nor orange without a 
skin You were one of the few men in England who I thought would see 
what I meant But it requires an effort, and it is only an historical study 
of language in all its phases that has at last led me to the conviction 
that the Greeks were right, and that what really makes us men and 
distinguishes us from the animal, is the Logos, 1 e , the gathering or, as 
Hobbes said, addition and subtraction 

Considering language in its next stage, that is, after it had come 
into existence, Max Muller held that language had growth , but not 
history The second of his first series of lectures was devoted to

explaining the growth of language in contradistinction to the history 
of language ‘We must distinguish/ he said, ‘between historical 
change and natural growth Art, science, philosophy, and religion 
all have a history, language, or any other production of nature, 
admits only of growth ’ But the term ‘growth 5 , he explained, must 
be taken, if it is applied to language, in a sense which is wholly 
different from what it has when employed in connexion with the 
natural unfolding of organic beings The idea of growth in respect 
of language was like the idea of growth of the crust of the earth, 
1 e , a process comparable to geological formations, by means of 
which continuous new combinations were formed out of given ele- 
ments without the control of free agents It was not surprising 
therefore that he should apply the term stratification to the process 
of linguistic evolution 

He illustrated this by giving the example of the relationship of 
Italian to Latin, and observed that 

If we call Italian the daughter of Latin, we do not mean to ascribe to 
Italian a new vital principle Not a single radical element was newly 
created for the formation of Italian Italian is modern Latm, or Latin 
ancient Italian The names mother and daughter only mark different 
periods in the growth of a language substantially the same To speak of 
Latm dying in giving birth to her offspring is again pure mythology, 
and it would be easy to prove that Latm was a living language long 
after Italian had learnt to run alone 

Growth of language so defined comprised two processes which 
had to be caiefully distinguished though they might be at work 
(Simultaneously Max Muller called these processes. Dialectal 
Regeneration and Phonetic Decay 

By ‘phonetic decay 5 he understood a very special aspect of the 
continuous phonetic changes in any language by means of which it 
passed from the ‘isolatory 5 stage to the ‘inflectionary 5 stage — that is 
to say, from the stage in which the relations of words or the various 
extensions and modifications of their denotations were expressed 
by employing two or more words with independent meaning, to the 
stage in which the modifying independent words lost their inde- 
pendence and became vestigial sounds like inflections and con- 
stituted in their totality the whole range of the accidence of a lan- 
guage In simple words, Max Muller said, it was phonetic decay 
which created truly grammatical forms

197 

He illustrated the process by taking the word ‘twenty’ — 20 
In Greek, Latm, Sanskrit, English and French the word for this 
number was originally composed of two elements — ten and two so 
that in its formation the word stands for £ two tens’, but through 
phonetic decay the two words together have come to stand for one 
concept In Chinese, however, twenty had remained two tens = eul- 
shi without any phonetic decay It was Chinese and the monosyl- 
labic languages related to it which, Max Muller observed, had re- 
mained immune to the disease of phonetic decay 

On the other hand, by ‘dialectal regeneration’ he understood not 
only the creation of a new language through the break-up of the 
sounds of a language which had ceased to grow by becoming written 
and literary, but also the entire existence of spoken words as a 
language unembodied in literature and writing It was only as dia- 
lects that language had growth, which always stopped when they 
were written down in a standard form What people were accus- 
tomed to call languages, such as the literary idioms of Greece, Rome, 
ancient India or modern Europe must be considered, he said, as 
artificial, and the real and natural life of languages was to be found 
only in the dialects 

According to him it was a mistake to imagine that dialects every- 
where were corruptions of the literary language Even in England, 
he observed, the local dialects had many forms which were more 
primitive than the language of Shakespeare, and the richness of 
their vocabulary surpassed on many points that of the classical 
writers of English of any period. Dialects had always been the 
feeders rather than the channels of a literary language They were 
parallel streams which existed long before one of them was raised 
to that temporary eminence which was the result of literary 
cultivation 

Whatever the origin of language among men its first tendency, 
he said, must have been towards an unbounded variety To this 
there was a natural check in a parallel development towards forming 
a national and literary language Before there can be a national 
language there must be hundreds of dialects in districts, towns, 
villages, clans and families, and though the progress of civilization 
and centralization tended to reduce their number and to soften 
their features, it had not yet annihilated them 

Max Muller described this process of continuous break-up and 
reformation of language in a passage of extraordinary vividness in 



198 SCHOLAR EXTRAORDINARY 

his first series of lectures I shall give it almost wholly in his words 
Literary dialects pay for their temporary greatness by inevitable 
decay and they are haunted by their own ghost They are like stag- 
nant lakes at the side of great rivers They form reservoirs of what 
was once living and running speech, but they are no longer carried 
on by the mam current At times it may seem as if the whole stream 
of language was absorbed by these lakes, and we can hardly trace 
the small rivulets which run on in the mam bed 

Or, he said, it may be more accurate to compare a classical or 
literary idiom with the frozen surface of a river, brilliant and 
smooth, but stiff and cold It is mostly by political commotions 
that this surface of more polite and cultivated speech is broken and 
carried away by the waters rising from underneath It is during 
times when the higher classes are either crushed in religious or 
social struggles, or mix again with the lower classes to repel foreign 
invasion, when literary occupations are discouraged, palaces burnt, 
monasteries pillaged and seats of learning destroyed , it is then that 
the popular dialects, which had formed a kind of undercurrent, 
rise beneath the crystal surface of the literary language and sweep 
away, like the waters in spring, the cumbrous formations of a 
bygone age , 

^ In more peaceful times, a new and popular literature springs up 
m a language which seems to have been formed by conquest and 
revolutions, but which in reality had been growing up long before, 
and was only brought out, ready-made, by historical events From 
this point of view, we can see that no literary language can ever be 
said to have been the mother of another language As soon as a 
language loses its undoubted capacity for change, its carelessness 
about what it throws away, and its readiness in always supplying 
the wants of mind and heart instantaneously, its natural life is 
changed into a merely artificial existence It may still live on for a 
long time, but while it seems to be the leading shoot, it is in reality 
but a broken and withering branch, slowly falling from the stock 
from which it sprang/ 

These are a few of Max Muller's ideas about language which I 
have selected for their general interest out of an immense number 
which were always coming out of his active and fertile mind It will 
however be noticed that all of these ideas relate to that stage of the 
science of language which he called the theoretical That was the 
field in which lay his deepest and most active interest. But these

conclusions, philosophical rather than strictly linguistic as they were, 
had their basis on a very solid knowledge of linguistic facts in the 
other two stages of the science, namely, the empirical and the classi- 
ficatory His mastery of these facts was certainly greater than that 
which Spengler had of historical facts in presenting his philosophy of 
history, and would seem to be more complete than the knowledge 
of the past of different human groups which Toynbee had when he 
wrote his Study of History The dislike which contemporary specia- 
lists feel for sweeping generalizations is only a narrow intellectual 
pose, or rather a fashion It is not intellectually justifiable Genera- 
lization and detailed study of facts are only two sides of the same 
process of knowing They may alternate cyclically, or they may be 
taken up by persons of different but complementary temperaments 
at the same time, or even by the same person to satisfy two sides of 
his yearning for knowledge No one could say that Eddington, 
Jeans, or in these times Hoyle or Heisenberg, as mathematicians 
or physicists, had no right to their cosmological speculations 
In regard to the empirical stage of the science of language, Max 
Muller was one of the great authorities of his age He was a pioneer 
m Sankritic studies both as an explorer and as an exploiter And 
since it was the discovery and knowledge of Sanskrit which had 
created the science of Comparative Philology, the empirical founda- 
tions of his theories cannot be said to have been inadequate Max 
Muller himself knew this very well, and wrote 

Sanskrit certainly forms the only foundation of Comparative Philology, 
and it will always remain the only safe guide through all its intricacies. 
A comparative philologist without a knowledge of Sanskrit is like an 
astronomer without a knowledge of mathematics He may admire, he 
may observe, he may discover, but he will never feel satisfied, he will 
never feel certain, he will never feel quite at home 

Perhaps there was a certain amount of exaggeration in this state- 
ment, but that was not unnatural in an age (1868) when Sanskrit 
was still the mam element in the growing science of linguistics. 

In the classificatory stage of the science Max Muller's writings 
not only established the concept of an Indo-European family of 
languages more firmly, but they also popularized it in a manner 
nobody else rivalled But his own special contribution in the field 
of classification or taxonomy of language was not purely philological 
it extended to the social and cultural spheres He spread the idea of 



200 SCHOLAR EXTRAORDINARY 

a common Aryan family and culture, from which a number of re- 
lated societies and cultures had evolved It had important social, 
cultural and even political consequences in many countries So its 
character and validity will have to be examined later. 

What remains to be done here is only to place Max Muller’s 
linguistic work in its proper perspective in the history of the science 
of linguistics Long before his death, in fact even from the middle 
of the seventies, his ideas on language began to be challenged, and 
many later workers in the field thought that they were being super- 
seded But hardly any pioneer worker in any science would expect 
or even wish it to be otherwise, although he might have made a 
fundamental contribution to its creation But such a statement 
about Max Muller’s work would apply only to the more technical 
part of his contribution His speculations covered the origin and 
nature of language, about which the present age, in spite of all the 
research which has followed, is no more certain than was Max 
Muller’s age In the very nature of things there can be no finality on 
such questions 

In any case, Max Muller was perfectly aware of his position, and 
if he was being left behind he showed himself to be perfectly recon- 
ciled to the possibility He knew very well that it was the inevitable 
fate of all investigators. He noted this in the case of Professor H H 
Wilson, who was really the first genuine English Sanskritist on the 
strength of his own knowledge of the language Of him Muller 
said that he had done nothing but original work, but was abused for 
not always having found at the first trial what others discovered 
when standing on his shoulders In his posthumous autobiography 
he said the same thing about himself in connexion with an essay 
of his on the Turanian languages Tt was published’, he wrote, *m 
1854, but it still continues to be criticized as if it had been pub- 
lished last year ’ Then he commented wisely, though also sadly 
‘No astronomer is blamed for not having known the planet Neptune 
before its discovery in 1846, or having been wrong in accounting for 
the irregularities of Saturn But let that pass I only share the fate of 
others who have lived too long ’ 

But there was more to it By living as long as he did, Max Muller 
passed from one age of learning to another, not only in respect of 
his own subject but of all subjects that is to say, from the age of 
exploration to that of intensive cultivation By the end of the nine- 
teenth century the age of specialization was already in full stride

201 


But to say that for this reason all that had preceded was obsolete, is 
like saymg that it is only reaping that matters, and not sowing Max 
Muller began his linguistic work in the full age of wonder of his 
science, and he was perfectly aware of the function of wonder in the 
progress of human knowledge ‘Wonder/ he observed in his Rede 
Lecture delivered before the University of Cambridge in 1868, ‘no 
doubt rises from ignorance, but from a peculiar kind of ignorance, 
from what might be called a fertile ignorance, an ignorance which, 
if we look back at the history of most of our sciences, will be found 
to have been the mother of all human knowledge ’ 

But what he noted with surprise was that the wonder that was 
incentive to knowledge was not present in respect of all subjects in 
any particular age For ages, he said, men had looked at the earth 
with its stratifications and at the embedded petnfications of orgamc 
creatures, and yet they looked and passed on, thinking no more of 
it, and without wondering Not even an Aristotle had eyes to see, 
so that the conception of a science of earth was reserved for the 
eighteenth century. 

In the same way, he added, men regarded language without 
wonder Centuries had elapsed since the first names were given to 
all cattle, to the fowls of the air, and to all beasts — here, too, the 
clearly marked lines of different strata seemed almost to challenge 
attention, but still the conception of a science of language was 
reserved for the nineteenth century 

In all his work on language Max Muller continued the age of 
wonder of linguistics both for himself and his readers and hearers 
He made a wide circle of men and women aware of the romance of 
language, as he was himself attracted by the romance He could say: 

Bliss was it in that dawn to be alive, 

But to be young was very heaven * 


### OXFORD-DARK AND BRIGHT
Chapter 4 

OXFORD-DARK AND BRIGHT 

By the time Max Muller, as Taylorian Professor, had become an 
associate member, so to speak, of the academic club of Oxford — the 
date being February 1854 — the university had ceased to be the 
happy convent it was even in 1848 The Pax Oxomana was shat- 
tered at one stroke by the appointment of the Royal Commission of 
1850 As Mark Pattison said, if a man had fallen asleep in 1846 and 
woken up again in 1850 he would have found himself in a different 
world It was tom into two factions, the opponents and the sup- 
porters of reform The old guard was in power, and feeling ran so 
high against the renegades that one of them asked a junior professor 
to invite him to dinner because the heads of colleges would no longer 
admit him to their table Actually, the Commission made a dif- 
ference to the social habits of Oxford Before its appointment there 
were hardly any private dinners besides those in the halls But the 
Commission broke up the academic society into sets, and private 
dinners had to keep up the social life of those who were excluded 
from the high table on account of their support for reform 

The umversity as an official body refused to co-operate with the 
Commission It questioned not only the kind of reform that was 
proposed, but also the power of Parliament to legislate for Oxford 
‘The Government did not know Oxford, nor Oxford the Govern- 
ment/ was the accepted formula, and men who were thorough- 
going Erastians in always submitting to the supremacy of the State 
over the Anglican Church, now opposed the intervention of the 
State in the affairs of an organ of the same Church — the University 
of Oxford As Max Muller found, even those who thought reform 
necessary were afraid of calling in the government Some of them 
told him that if they once let in the government, it would interfere 
too much 

The case of the opponents of reform, a majority of whom cer- 
tainly put the vested interests of a closed corporation before 
education, was stated at its most idealistic and disinterested by Dr 
Pusey He was never in doubt about the basic issue, which in his 
eyes was clear should Oxford continue to be a religious body in 



OXFORD — DARK AND BRIGHT

obedience to the intentions of the founders, or was it to become 
merely a seculai educational institution ? He had only one answer 
to the question He did not object to improvements, but declared 
firmly ‘Only let it be xeally solid, and, above all, under the control 
of a firm, unwavering faith, to the glory of God It will yet be well 
with Oxfoid if she forget not her own motto — Dominus illummatio 
mea ' None the less, the Commission reported, and the reform bill 
was passed What shocked the anti-reform men most was that 
Gladstone, the member for Oxford and at first an opponent of State 
interference, became a convert himself and carried through the 
reforming measures in Parliament For this he was to lose his seat 
later But reform was set in motion, and Dr Pusey, who was to fight 
the rearguard action against it to the last, could only lament Fuit 
Ilium, futt Ilium f — We were Trojans once, but Troy is gone 1 

Of course, old Oxford did not die at once For at least two 
decades it kicked very hard, and even after that a core of anti- 
reform opinion remained there, just as Jacobitism survived into the 
Hanoverian age The most characteristic expression of the conser- 
vative attitude is to be found in seven volumes of reproductions of 
Oxford caricatures preserved in the Bodleian Satire is always con- 
servative, as the whole tradition from Aristophanes to Punch proves 
3o were these caricatures, and even more so their captions, in 
nany instances in faultless Greek or Latin, which showed that 
eform had served even the satirists by raising the level of classical 
iducation at Oxford 

As was to be expected, all the champions of reform came in for 
heir share of ridicule or censure, and most of all Jowett, who was 
lot only a very active reformer, but was also suspected of having a 
jood deal of arriere-pensee in his reforming zeal 

Academic refoim at Oxford in the second half of the nineteenth 
entury, like parliamentary reform, was earned out in three stages, 
►efore and after 1854 by a commission of inquiry, an Act of Parha- 
rient and an executive commission There was in 1872 another 
ommission of inquiry, and an Act of 1877 This was followed by 
n executive commission from 1877 to 1881 As a result, there was 
ubstantial improvement in details of organization as *vell as teach- 
ig But there was no revolutionary change in the university's formal 
ructure and functioning For instance, the very basil issues which 
le reformers had raised, such as the relation betwecnlhe university 
id the colleges, the imbalance between professori jf and tutorial 



204 SCHOLAR EXTRAORDINARY 

teaching, of the extension of research, were dealt with superficially 
and remained open even till after the First World War, when they 
had to be examined again 

Nevertheless, a great change certainly came over the spirit in 
which Oxford carried on its work This was due far less to the specific 
measures of reform than to the Zeitgeist , illustrating the invariable 
principle that it is the society which shapes the educational system, 
and not the system the society 

Once anybody wanted to see it, the basic transformation was all 
too obvious As an institution, from having been an educational 
monastery run by a clerical oligarchy deriving its authority from an 
overwhelmingly clerical franchise of Masters of Art, the university 
became for all practical purposes a secular body In function, it 
ceased to be primarily a clerical seminary, and though it did not lose 
its novices, it became the educational centre of a modern bureau- 
cratic State and a worldwide Imperial polity In putting their classi- 
cal disciplines to this extended use, the dons of Oxford took a great 
deal of pride as the teachers of senators, consuls and proconsuls But 
m reality it was the British Imperial State which made the umversity 
serve it, in the same way as the schools of rhetoric and law in Rome 
and the schools of philosophy in Athens served the Roman Empire. 

Naturally schooling, widened and immensely improved, re- 
mained the mam function of Oxford, and the dominance of the 
colleges and the tutorial system continued Among the students 
the crammers more or less balanced the idlers Despite all that, the 
outstanding feature of the reformed Oxford was not that it became 
a better university, but that it was converted into a very advanced 
public school For its students Greek and Latin meant what they 
did at Eton, Harrow or Rugby, and by an unwritten convention 
sport and games became a part of the academic curriculum As a 
result, they lost their free and personal character, and became or- 
ganized, obligatory, strenuous and honoured disciplines Those 
who regarded boat-racing as being as much a part of Oxford educa- 
tion as were the Greats, did not always recollect, even if they were 
dons instead of undergraduates, how recent this was. Muscular 
Christianity pleached by some Oxford men never became a force 
m English life, but muscular umversity education did 

With this transformation Oxford ceased to be the home of 
dreams and lost causes, and offered a complete contrast to its past by 
becoming a participant in British success and by affiliating itself 



OXFORD— DARK AND BRIGHT 205 

to the imperial greatness of Britain Gladstone, who set the reform- 
ing movement going, did not seem to be wholly satisfied with what 
he had sponsored, and on his deathbed he could only recall the 
Oxford dedicated to the glory of God which he had known in his 
student days Thus to a message sent to him by the Hebdomadal 
Council in 1898 he replied £ There is no expression of Christian 
sympathy that I value more than that of the ancient university of 
Oxford, the God-fearing and God-sustaimng university of Oxford. 
I served her, perhaps mistakenly, but to the best of my ability ’ But 
that Oxford of his was as dead as that of Newman By the end of the 
century Oxford had transferred its allegiance from God to Caesar. 

The imperialistic re-orientation of Oxford quite naturally brought 
into existence a worship and awareness of Oxford education such 
as had not existed before The men who passed out from unre- 
formed Oxford took their association with it for granted, as they 
did their parentage and their ancestral homes But the products of 
reformed Oxford began to look upon themselves as members of a 
corps d’ehte, and acquired a feeling for it which was similar to 
conscious family pride In the normal English Oxonian, this pride 
remained unassertive and reticent, though at times very studiedly so 
and therefore not quite convincing in its modesty But among those 
Englishmen who went out from Oxford to the colonies and depen- 
dencies, and among the White colonials and the Orientals who came 
to Oxford, the cult of Oxford became meretricious, and even dubious 

The worship of Oxford as exported was of a piece with the 
English imperialistic sentiment of the late mneteenth century, which 
was self-conscious, intellectually shoddy, and wholly unworthy of 
the historic phenomenon that the British Empire in its practical 
existence really was Thus it was natural that Cecil Rhodes, the 
most counterfeit of English imperialists, who thought that spec- 
tacular financial success in a colony (and of all places on the Rand), 
gave him a right to patronize the British Empire, should become a 
benefactor of Oxford And the callowness of the imperialism of 
Oxford was shown by its grateful acceptance of his bounty Even 
Oriel accepted it, and allowed Rhodes Gaudens to look down on the 
university church of St Mary the Virgin from his niche in the 
pediment opposite 

But the most baneful impact of imperialistic Oxford was seen 
m the Indians who came there. The English civil servants and 
educationalists in India were mostly from one or other of the two

ancient universities, and they buttressed their prestige there by 
fostering an abject worship of Oxford and Cambridge among 
Indians So the more ambitious and wealthy among them came over 
for their higher education, which was really a pursuit of career and 
prestige, and even with a third-class degree they could ensure both 
If they were clever enough they could make an aegrotat degree do 
as well But they also showed what a femme fatale Oxford or 
Cambridge could be for them 

Max Muller at Oxford saw many of them, and in spite of being a 
champion of India and Indians he has not left a favourable account 
of them As he put it 

The manners of young Indians when they arrive at Oxford are generally 
excellent, but they soon acquire what they consider English manners, 
rough and ready, bluff and blunt, and by no means an improvement 
on their own The same young man who at first enters your room with 
folded hands and a graceful salaam, will after a very short time walk in, 
sit down, stretch out his legs, and address you in the most familiar 
terms They imagine this is English 

He continued 

Even if they pass their examinations, I am afraid that some of them 
return to India not much improved by their English exile The worst 
of it is that they often return desillusionne At first everything English is 
grand and perfect in their eyes, an Oxford degree is the highest goal of 
their ambition But when they have obtained it, chiefly by learning by 
heart, they make very light of it And this making light of it is soon 
applied to other things English also, which they hear constantly criti- 
cized or abused, particularly in the newspapers and parliament, so that 
they often leave England better informed, it may be, but hardly better 
affected towards the Government which they are meant to serve 

^ Max Muller had some understanding of what rankled in the 
mmds of these Indian students It was the absence of personal rela- 
tions with their English fellow-students 

At Oxford [he wrote] they find it very hard to make friends among the 
better class of undergraduates Most of our undergraduates come from 
public schools, and have plenty of friends of their own If they are 
asked to be kind to any of the Indian students, all they can do, or really

pride and treating it as conscious apartheid Moreover, they them-

their prosperity and prestige, showed an arrogance to their own 
countrymen which was not less than that of the English rulers This

cising any influence on the life and culture of their own people In 
fact, some of the most brilliant Indian students of Oxford turned 
out to be the worst careerists in their country Even Nehru failed 
to impinge on Indian life and behaviour with his ideas 

Max Muller also had a concept of a possible Imperial role for 
Oxford and Cambridge, but in its combination of vision with 
realism it was in complete contrast to the pretentious and artificial 
idea which lay behind the Rhodes Scholarships He did not believe 
that the peculiarly English traits and outlooks could be imposed on 
aliens simply by giving them an opportunity to pass through the 
two universities In fact, in a letter written to the Duke of Argyll 
when he became Secretary of State for India in 1868, Muller said 

India can never be anglicized, but it can be remvigorated By encourag- 
ing a study of their own ancient literature, as part of their education, a 
national feeling of pride and self-respect will be reawakened among 
those who influence large masses of the people A new national litera- 
ture may spring up, impregnated with Western ideas, yet retaining its 
native spirit and character A new national literature will bring with 
it a new national and a new moral vigour

aliens simply by giving them an opportunity to pass through the 
two universities In fact, in a letter written to the Duke of Argyll 
when he became Secretary of State for India in 1868, Muller said. 

India can never be anglicized, but it can be remvigorated By encourag- 
ing a study of their own ancient literature, as part of their education, a 
national feeling of pride and self-respect will be reawakened among 
those who influence large masses of the people A new national litera- 
ture may spnng up, impregnated with Western ideas, yet retaxnmg its 
native spirit and character A new national literature will bring with 
it a new national and a new moral vigour. 

Historically, this was exactly what happened in the second half of 
the nineteenth century in Bengal, but it did not come about by

bringing Indians to Oxford and Cambridge Max Muller’s pre- 
scription was to give the desired education in India by training 
Englishmen at Oxford to play their educational role there effectively 
He saw the fulfilment of British rule in India in this educational 
mission, which was really a task of cultural proselytization He had 
put forward the idea as early as 1856, in a letter written to Bunsen 
m which he said 'After the last annexation the territorial conquest 
of India ceases — what follows next is the struggle in the realm of 
religion and of the spirit, in which, of course, centres the interests 
of the nations ’ He repeated the idea in different words to the Duke 
of Argyll 'India has been conquered once, but India must be con- 
quered again, and that second conquest should be a conquest by 
education ’ 

He added in the same letter that as a result of Western education 
a class of young Indians had already risen in Bengal, who were 
known as Young Bengal and who were ready to play their part in 
this movement of cultural proselytization, because they were the 
'product of English ideas grafted on the native mind’ He informed 
the Duke that Englishmen in India were always finding fault with 
this Young Bengal, but set down his view that in spite of their faults 
they had promise, observing shrewdly that ‘their faults were apparent 
everywhere, but their good qualities were naturally hidden from the 
eyes of careless observers’ Then he gave the example of a young 
Bengali who had just published a book on his travels in Europe, in 
which he said that 'if it was the will of Providence that a nation 
would have a yoke on its neck the yoke of the English was the least 
galling’ Max Muller also quoted to the Duke the words in which 
this young man summed up the achievement of the English people 
m India, and at the same time put his finger on the weak spot of the 
British attitude towards Indians . 

Nothing less than British phlegm, and imperturbability, and constancy, 
and untiring energy could have steadily prosecuted the task of con- 
solidating the disjointed masses of India, and casting her into the 
mould of one compact nation They want but ‘high thoughts seated in 
a heart of courtesy 5 to attach us to their rule, with a feeling of loyalty 
that, not merely playing round the head, should come near to the 
heart 


On this Muller commented . 'A society leavened by such men will 
make it possible for the Government to save hundreds and thou-

sands in soldiers and policemen, and millions in wars and sup- 
pression of rebellions * 

Muller had also thought out how the emergence of such a class 
of Indians could be promoted It was that young Englishmen 
should have the kind of education in English universities which 
would make them capable of playing their cultural role by giving 
them on the one hand intellectual competence and knowledge and, 
on the other, sympathy and understanding for the Indian people 
The very first step which had to be taken to realize this purpose was 
to create a school of Indian languages in the universities His long 
campaign to establish such an institution and to introduce the study 
of Oriental languages in England, has been described in the previous 
chapter 

But Max Muller’s concept of a cultural mission in India was 
never taken seriously in England, either in its doctrmal or in its 
practical aspect On the contrary, young Englishmen went to serve 
m India in ignorance of the country and with contempt for the 
people The only corrective to that situation, which was provided 
more by the circumstances than by any conscious perception of the 
problem, was to bring young Indians over to Oxford or Cambridge, 
give them an English veneer, and sterilize them It was an applica- 
tion of the idea which afterwards Rhodes consecrated with his 
money. This was a negation of true imperialism, and it is no wonder 
that the country named after Rhodes and the country where he 
achieved his spectacular success have both become the most unequi- 
vocal symbols of the failure of British imperialism 

However, one must not judge the imperial aspect of reformed 
Oxford by its expression among the colonial British and the Indians 
educated at Oxford and Cambridge. It had a higher and more im- 
posing aspect, as shown by men such as Curzon and Milner who 
were more authentic Oxford men than Rhodes Long before either 
of them Max Muller had found himself wishing that the lure of the 
Indian Civil Service had not brought Indians to Oxford, and that 
they had remained in their own country to serve it as scholars and 
thinkers. 

In spite of all this an Oxford Magna did emerge out of the re- 
forms, between which and the larger political and imperial existence 
of the English people there was a very close nexus Oxford, too, 
became proudly conscious of the relationship In the earlier stages 
of reform the most majestic political personality moulded by

Oxfoid, Gladstone, was hounded out, but with the completion of 
reform the university took pride in noting the fact that in the last 
year of the nineteenth century there were ten Oxford men in a 
Cabinet presided over by its Chancellor 

Along with this however the old Oxford Parva was not only 
allowed to survive, but was even infused with a new vitality Its 
scholarship, speculations and art of living were made more active 
and fervid All activities of the mind were recreations pursued and 
valued more for the sense of self-realization than for the contribution 
they made to knowledge or thought Nowhere was the Latin saying 
Abeunt studia in mores (study fulfils itself in a manner of living) 
better illustrated than in this little Oxford, Oxford Parva sed Apia 
There settled on its grey stones some light from far away Fiesole and 
Sienna The men who represented this Oxford were figures like 
T H Greene, F H Bradley, Walter Pater, to mention only a 
typical few 

The scholarly and speculativ e creations of this Oxford enlivened, 
enriched, and sustained mental life in the outside world, even in- 
cluding India But in its own existence they were only parerga 
aeademica y incidental music at a banquet The value of the educa- 
tion which Oxford gave was frankly recognized by all , but anyone 
who knew anything about scholarship, learning, science and specu- 
lative thought, also knew that love of knowledge for its own sake 
was the last thing fostered by new Oxford among its students On 
this point foreigners, natives and domiciled foreigners were all 
agreed Renan observed that a minor German university with its 
poor and uncouth professors did more for the human spirit than the 
aristocratic university of Oxford with its princely revenues, its 
magnificent buildings, its opulent style of living and its idle fellows 

Pattison, whose one positive passion in life was the pursuit of 
learning and who as reformer had before his eyes the vision of 
Oxfoid as a home of higher research and advanced learning, be- 
came a confirmed misanthrope when reform was at last fully under 
way He did not deny that Oxford efficiently performed its function 
as a great national lycee But this was precisely the Oxford he dis- 
liked and disapproved of To him this function showed a preference 
for the ‘lower states of education of which all men do or can par- 
take’, as against the superior education which a university pro- 
fesses to administer In his exasperated moments he called this 
Oxford a cramming shop

Max Muller, who was associated with the reformers from the 
beginning but would not take any active part in the movement be- 
cause he was a foreigner, very soon became disappointed with the 
outcome of the reforms Even in 1855 he wrote 'Oxford is in a sad 
condition , the reform has done nothing, and we are worse off than 
before Gladstone’s Bill has introduced a complicated and im- 
practical system, which suffocates all proposals for the better . 
What remains therefore is nothing but the coffee-grounds which 
nobody desires to have — clergymen without a parish and scholars 
without scholarship 1 ’ 

Thirteen years later, on October 27, 1S68, he spoke no less em- 
phatically in his inaugural lecture delivered as the new Professor 
of Comparative Philology 

Noblesse oblige [he declared] applies to Oxford at the present moment 
more than ever, when knowledge for its own sake and a chivalrous 
devotion to studies which command no price in the fair of the world, 
and lead to no place of emolument in Church or State, are looked down 
upon and ridiculed by almost everybody 

There is no career in England at the present time for scholars and 
students No father could honestly advise his son, whatever talent he 
might display, to devote himself exclusively to classical, historical, or 
physical studies The few men who still keep up the fair name of 
England by independent research and new discoveries in the fields of 
political and natural history, do not always come from our universities , 
and unless they possess independent means, they cannot devote more 
than their leisure hours, left by their official duties in Church or State, 
to the prosecution of their favourite studies 

This, he declared, neither ought to be nor need be, for if only 
twenty men at Oxford and Cambridge had the will everything was 
ready for reform and the restoration of the ancient glory of Oxford 
In 1878, a writer giving a portrait of Max Muller in Contemporary 
Portraits , New Series, No 10, quoted the passage from his inau- 
gural lecture and explained why it was so, as he saw it 'The reason,’ 
he said, 'that meets these pertinent queries is the shameful one that 
Oxford is of the world and that in the world’s ways the ideally best 
must hide its shamefaced beauty before the power of position, the 
scorn of vested interests, the laziness of the luxurious, the intrigues 
of self-seekers, the worshippers of material prestige .* 

Strong as this was, it was also the view of the life and aspirations

of the Oxford dons held by the town, which had very little respect 
for the gown As it happened, the university and the colleges were 
themsehes responsible for creating such notions They had refused 
to disclose the facts about their revenues to the Commission of 1850, 
and, as a result, speculation was rife about their hidden and hoarded 
wealth It was the Cleveland Commission of 1872, which, in its 
report published in 1874, for the first time fully revealed the extent 
of the wealth and properties of the university and the colleges, and 
show ed that they were neither as wealthy as many had supposed, 
nor careless as landowners But great landowners they still were, the 
university being the junior partner and the colleges collectively the 
semor The income of the two was classified under six heads 
(1) Lands, (2) house property, (3) tithe rent charges, (4) other rent 
charges, such as free farm rents and fixed charges, (5) stocks, 
shares, and other securities , (6) receipts from fines, tuition, minerals, 
etc Overwhelmingly, the money came from landed property, of 
which the university had 7,684 acres, and the colleges jointly 
184,764 acres The total income of the university was £47,000, of 
wdiich £29,000 came from property The total income of the 
colleges was £363,000, of which £280,000 came from the same 
source 

The authorities of the university and the colleges showed them- 
selves as very competent managers, and never buried their material 
talents Mark Pattison, with all his love of learning and absorption 
m mental life, was not less attentive to the properties of Lincoln 
Jowett, for all his cherubic looks, was an astute business man both 
as master and as Vice-Chancellor Max Muller has left a most illu- 
minating account of the business flair of an Oxford don and clergy- 
man, Dr Bull, Canon and Bursar of Christ Church 

A well-known banker had for years been handling the money of 
Christ Church, and no one suspected him One day, however, 
Dr Bull invited him to dinner, and he was struck by the very pious 
and orthodox remarks the banker made, which he thought suited a 
Canon of Christ Church more than a wealthy and worldly banker 
from London Without saying a word Dr Bull went to London the 
next day, drew out all the money of the college, and the day after, 
to the dismay of all London, the bank failed All the other depositors 
lost their money, but not Christ Church 

But in the pre-reform days, that is, in the days of the Don Logs, 
the scramble was not indecorous, for the distribution of patronage

and preferment was controlled by a fixed procedure and confined 
to an oligarchy without reference to merit But the reforms which 
dragged merit into the question of preferment, at once promoted 
the scramble by bringing into existence a class of pushing Don 
Storks and giving respectability to their monetary ambitions The 
first appearances of the factionalism were seen in the rejection of 
Pattison’s claim to the Rectorship of Lincoln in 1851 and of Jowett’s 
to the Mastership of Balliol in 1854 Max Muller was also to suffer 
from it, as will be related later For a decade or so the tactics for deny- 
ing money to a person not acceptable to the dominating caucus was 
to fasten the odium theologicum on him But as time passed the re- 
ligious or dogmatic narrowness declined, and the scramble became 
a tussle for money pure and simple 

Two men, above everybody else, stood out among the leading 
personalities of the reforming Oxford in the latter half of the nine- 
teenth century, and they represented both its bright and dark sides 
They were, of course, Jowett and Pattison No one living at Oxford 
in those days could be unaware of their overwhelming presence 
Jowett provided its son et lumiere , and Pattison its thunder and 
lightning Moreover no one, judging them contemporaneously or in 
historical retrospect, could deny that they had their unquestionable, 
though particular, greatness and genius But no one could also fail 
to be conscious that both had traits of character which repelled or 
alienated. No theologian to my knowledge has described what the 
fallen angels were like when they had rebelled and been thrown out 
of heaven Jowett and Pattison could give a very good idea of them, 
the first as Belial and the second as Moloch Both showed them- 
selves at Oxford as seraphim who had qualified for hell „ 

It is curious that of the two Pattison should, in the final summing- 
up, turn out to be the better scholar Jowett was the best boy at 
St Paul’s, won the Balliol scholarship, was elected fellow as an 
undergraduate and took a first Pattison, on the contrary, never 
went to school and was taught by his father at home, got a second 
class at Oxford, and after failing to be elected fellow at Oriel, 
University and Balliol, got a Lincoln fellowship as a sort of consola- 
tion prize Yet he could despise Jowett’s scholarship. But Mark 
Pattison’s poor opinion of Jowett’s scholarship was both unfair 
and irrelevant” Scholarship is a matter of temperament Pattison had 
that, while Jowett did not Jowett was essentially and above all a 
pedagogue and a moralist. What Jowett sought to do was to pour 



214 SCHOLAR EXTRAORDINARY 

on to the three mam interests of nineteenth- century Englishmen, 
politics, money and religion, the spikenard of a refurbished Hel- 
lenism, which might be called Victorian neo-Platomsm, but which 
was of course very much more superficial Jowett was called 
‘Master’ by men and women of fashion, and the Master he 
remained 

Pattison could see with perfect clearness where he and Jowett 
differed as to the end of university education ‘The separation be- 
tween Jowett and myself’, he wrote, ‘consists in a difference upon 
the fundamental question of university politics — viz , Science and 
Learning v School keeping ’ 

Pattison’s defects of character were obvious, and therefore clever 
novelists could satirize him easily Swinburne broke out with the 
epigram that Pattison was a ‘morally and spiritually typical and 
unmistakable ape of the Dead Sea’ Jowett’s failings, on the other 
hand, were extremely insidious, and could hardly be perceived by 
outsiders unless they were almost cynically percipient Also, he had 
the intelligence and moderation to utilize them for advancing his 
career rather than letting them damage it He was a flatterer of the 
aristocracy and of people of fashion 

There could be no doubt whatever but that Pattison was the 
greater man He achieved at its highest level the personality of a man 
endowed with great intellectual power and with a demoniac pas- 
sional potential, but without the faculty of positive and disinterested 
love which is the Christian cantas In its default, he was bound to 
arrive at the state of mind which proclaimed itself in an invincible 
repugnance for all action He feared moral and religious enthusiasm, 
for he knew not where it might lead He distrusted religion, and set 
down in his memoirs that ‘religion is a good servant, but a bad 
master’ 

In nothing else was the desiccation of Mark Pattison shown 
more characteristically than in his intense desire for love and his 
failure to get it, with one exception He wanted love, but never 
realized that love cannot be had without loving, without shedding 
all egoism Pattison in everything was an uninhibited egoist, and 
even his affection for Meta Bradley was a projection of his self-love 
flattered by the adoration of a weak woman His wife described her 
horror of his last days in the following words ‘Let not my last days 
be like his * The moral rum is awful ’ 

Jowett was the opposite He inspired affection and could also show 



OXFORD-DARK AND BRIGHT 215 

affection But the interchange was superficial, for he distrusted 
passion and always employed that word in a bad sense Therefore, 
over his puntamsm, which was both fierce and narrow, he suc- 
ceeded in laying a coat of unctuousness, which made worldlings 
look up to him for moral inspiration and guidance But there was 
also no doubt that his moral sense was fundamentally right His 
intellectual capacity and moral sensitiveness were such that one 
could not easily perceive that he was an adventurer V ery few adven- 
turers in the world have taken an adventurer’s life to a higher level, 
morally and intellectually 

There is one test which is dependable in judging the personality 
of any Oxford man in the latter half of the nineteenth century, and 
that is his attitude to John Henry Newman, the disinherited among 
the great sons of Oxford Jowett and Pattison agreed in substance 
over him, but in a wholly different spirit After reading the life of 
Newman, in 1891 Jowett wrote to Margot Tennant (later Asquith) 

Considering what he really was, it is wonderful what a space he has 
filled in the eyes of mankind In speculation he was habitually untruth- 
ful and not much better in practice His conscience had been taken out, 
and the Church put in its place Yet he was a man of genius, and a 
good man in the sense of bemg disinterested Truth is very often 
troublesome, but neither the world nor the individual can get on with- 
out it 

Mark Pattison also believed, like Jowett, that Newman did not 
care for truth apart from dogma, but he showed no personal dis- 
respect for him He had called Newman 'Master’, and to the end he 
called him that When Pattison was dying, Newman wrote to him 
expressing a wish to see him He at once agreed, though his anti- 
relxgious cynicism attributed a motive to the visit After it was over 
Pattison wrote Tt was not all personal regard, but the hope, how- 
ever slight, that I might still be got over in my last moments ’ 
Though cynical, the comment was not disrespectful to Newman 
personally Newman did have that hope, but it could not be dis- 
honourable in a man of faith to hope to bring back to the fold a 
follower who had strayed from it 

The truth of the matter is that in the unfolding of their careers 
both the men remained true to their origins, commercial and cleri- 
cal Jowett remained throughout the successful businessman, and 

Pattison the unsuccessful cleric

Between them they represented the new Oxford in its personal 
ambitions and in its consciously adopted educational role, though 
one gloated on success and the other almost exulted in failure 
There were, however, two others who kept up the spirit of old 
Oxford through the changing times, here again with contrasted 
results for themselves These men w ere Dr Pusey and Dean Lid- 
dell Pusey died fighting to the last for an Oxford in the service of 
religion Liddell adapted himself to the reformed Oxford very 
successfully, and even helped further reforms, but in spirit he re- 
mained true to old times 

A very mistaken idea of Dr Pusey as an intolerant bigot was 
current among his latter-day contemporaries, and still survives 
Actually, in spite of his failure and indeed owing to that very defeat 
— for at Oxford only defeat could canonize a man to greatness — he 
was the only samt and hero in the Oxford of the late nineteenth 
century He was indeed uncompromising in what he regarded as 
true doctrine and its application To give only one instance of his 
intolerance, which came within Max Muller’s personal knowledge 
he refused to admimster the Holy Communion to Muller because 
he had not been confirmed by a bishop But he also helped Muller 
m his efforts to get the Boden Professorship of Sanskrit, and no one 
canvassed more energetically for him He met the Hindu reformer 
Keshub Chunder Sen, and though they had a long argument, they 
also parted as friends He also had the warmest sympathy for stu- 
dents in every branch of Oriental philology After Pusey’s death in 
1882 Max Muller, who had considered him dangerous in early life, 
paid the most unqualified tribute to his greatness of character in a 
letter to The Times 

In fact, Pusey was a true Christian in the very combination of 
intolerance and understanding. There is no greater misrepresenta- 
tion of Christianity than to call it a religion of strength made perfect 
m weakness The modern conception of Christianity as a religion of 
degenerate compassion which enjoins tolerance for all human fail- 
ings, crimes and perversions, is a grotesque distortion On the 
contrary, Christianity was merciful to the weak because it was so 
strong Pusey was a true Christian in that he condemned himself 
(not merely others) as a sinner 

Pusey’s excessive sense of his own sinfulness may now seem 
horribly unnatural, but Christianity was never a religion for the 
natural man, whom it regarded as unregenerate man living in 



OXFORD— DARK AND BRIGHT 217 

original sin A conviction of sinfulness, however unfounded, was of 
the very essence of Christian faith and morality, and, as the bio- 
graphers of Pusey point out, self-condemnation has come from 
St Augustine, St Francis of Assisi, St Vincent de Paul, John 
Bunyan, St Francois de Sales and John Wesley Pusey only con- 
tinued that tradition It was strange that a man who was really 
angelic should consign himself to hell with only a slender hope that, 
justified by faith alone, he would be allowed to redeem himself 
there, whereas the two fallen angels, Pattison and Jowett, con- 
tinued to strut and bask in the heaven that was Oxford But cer- 
tainly Pusey’s self-torture was preferable to the moral complacence 
of Jowett, purred out to fashionable men and women, who saw in it 
a gilding of their worldly hedonism 

It was in such a setting that Max Muller had to live his life at 
Oxford His reaction was a strange dichotomy of attraction and 
repulsion, as was perhaps unavoidable from the dual nature of 
Oxford The whole relationship can be illustrated by Muller’s 
relations with Jowett, which were symbolic They became friends 
very early, and in all the vicissitudes of Jowett’s career Muller 
sided with him He was on Jowett’s side when the latter brought 
theological troubles on himself, and by that association Muller also 
got into trouble And he expressed himself even more strongly when 
at one stage the proposal to increase Jowett’s salary as Regius 
Professor of Greek fell through 

Yet there rankled in Muller’s mind some sense of grievance 
against Jowett, some dark suspicion of duplicity or disloyalty This 
came to a head early in 1876, at the time of the reconstitution of the 
terms of the Professorship of Comparative Philology Muller sus- 
pected Jowett of sitting on the fence, if not actually opposing the 
proposal After the matter had been settled in Muller’s favour and 
Jowett had supported him strongly, Muller wrote to Stanley that 
though he admitted Jowett had behaved well, he still could not 
quite forgive him He observed T cannot understand him Perhaps 
we make idols of our friends, and if they break we cannot bear it ’ 
There is finally the cool statement about Jowett in Muller’s auto- 
biography, published after his death* 

Jowett knew quite well, and he did not hesitate to say so, that to do 
much good in this world, you must be a very able and honest man, 
thinking of nothing else day and night; and he adds, ‘You must also be 



218 SCHOLAR EXTRAORDINARY 

a considerable piece of a rogue, having many reticences and conceal- 
ments ’ Now Professor Jowett has certainly done some good work 
at Oxford, but if any one were to say that he also was a considerable 
piece of a rogue, what an outcry there would be among the sons of 
Balliol 

The fact was that Max Muller by nature and upbringing was too 
simple a character to be quite at home at Oxford with all its com- 
plexity and sophistication He was uncomfortable with its subtle 
and often casuistical ethics, and on his part he repelled the more 
typically Oxford characters Mark Pattison, without knowing him 
intimately, gave the following psychological explanation of the 
failure of Muller to get the Boden Professorship Tt was due/ he 
said, 'first and chiefly, to his own unpopular manners and to the 
experience his own friends (including myself among the number) 
have had of his inability for real attachment We all knew that he 
only valued us so far as we could be of use to him 9 

For Pattison to say that of Muller was almost scandalous Muller 
never came to know of Pattison’s opinion, but he knew his man He 
looked upon Pattison as the best-read man at Oxford, and added. 
'Anywhere but at Oxford he would have grown into a Lessmg ’ 
None the less he also wrote to Bunsen 'Pattison is as reserved as 
ever, and trusts no one 5 

Moreover, on account of his German-trained mmd he yearned 
for a kind of intellectual communication at Oxford which its society 
regarded as ‘shop-talk’ Even at the age of forty-three Max Muller 
showed a metaphysical proclivity which Oxford, with all its Hegeli- 
zation, had no taste for Thus in 1867 Muller was complaining to 
Professor Bernays* 

What I miss most here in Oxford is stimulating intercourse in literary 
and scientific circles That is entirely wanting, especially in my special 
branch of study Altogether the Englishman seems to me to have no 
interest for the ‘becoming' or ‘growing 5 , it is all to be tangible and 
ready-made All dialectic is wanting in the true sense of the word 
However, there are deep shadows everywhere, and I do not want to 
forget the bnght sides of English life, and I am afraid that I should 
find it somewhat difficult to get accustomed again to the rather narrow 
German trousers 


He was however very grateful to Oxford, and added in the same 



OXFORD— DARK AND BRIGHT 219 

letter that ‘here in Oxford, I must say, everything is done to make 
up for what has been done amiss’ 

Max Muller decided to solve the social problem of remaining at 
Oxford by following St Paul’s dictum about the world Thou shalt 
be in it, but not of it He tried to keep aloof from the incessant 
movement of wheels within wheels at Oxford for monetary and 
other worldly advantages Nor would he join the reforming move- 
ment actively, because he felt that his open participation in it 
would do harm because he was a foreigner, and of all foreigners a 
German For this he suffered personally However, 1 emaimng depen- 
dent on the academic community of Oxford for money and position 
he could not hope to be entirely free of its intrigues, rivalries, anti- 
pathies and partisanships 

It is Muller’s involvement in the life that was the most typically 
Oxonian of all Oxford life which now has to be described It has 
already been seen how the delay in appointing him to the Taylorian 
Professorship had irked him But this post was not a university 
preferment, and in any case the appointment of a European as a 
lecturer on European languages was not likely to be resented So 
Max Muller had the Professorship easily The Greek language, 
however, was looked upon as a special prerogative of the Oxford 
dons After Liddell came to Christ Church as Dean in 1855, 
Muller discussed with him the Greek lexicon, the famous Liddell 
and Scott, and observed that, good as the dictionary was, its etymo- 
logies were mostly inaccurate Though Liddell was no student of 
comparative philology, he was broadminded enough to ask Muller 
to undertake the task of revising them All seemed settled between 
the two, when one day the Dean came to him, shrugged his shoul- 
ders, and said that the proposal had to be given up He did not 
explain the reason, though evidently he was very displeased 

It was only in 1898, two years before his death, that Muller 
learned from an anonymous review that Scott was the man who had 
obstructed the proposal for revision Even then Max Muller would 
not believe it, because in his early years at Oxford Scott has shown 
great kindness and courtesy to him He had heard also that Scott 
was associated with those who were against him in connexion with 
the Boden Professorship But it is quite possible that Scott had lost 
all friendly feeling for Muller because he was a friend of Jowett, to 
whom Scott had been preferred as Master of Balliol Privately, Max 
Muller held a poor opinion of Scott, and in 1870 he wrote to his 



220 SCHOLAR EXTRAORDINARY 

wife T consider Scott as a thoroughly dishonest man, and yet he is 
respected by many people Who knows who is right ^ 

The next step in the advancement of Max Muller at Oxford was, 
however, a most gratifying experience for him In 1858 he was 
elected a Fellow of All Souls, an unprecedented honour for a 
foreigner at that time This was done at the instance of Henry Coxe, 
Librarian of the Bodleian and known as Bodley Coxe Coxe enter- 
tained a very warm friendship for Muller and, realizing that the 
status and home offered by the college would be a great help to him, 
discussed it with another friend, Sir Robert Herbert, and they 
joined in pressing upon the Fellows of All Souls the advisability of 
electing him under the special powers conferred by the Act of 1854 
This was done, and Muller’s delight knew no bounds 

A writer, after his death recalling Muller’s life at Oxford, observed 
that he never ceased to find an exquisite kind of amusement in his 
own position as a Fellow of All Souls Tor him, the self-devoted 
Stuhengelehrte , the youth of austere training and unworldly ideals, 
to have drifted into that fat paradise of the voluptuaries of learning 
struck him as a delightful joke on the part of Fate, and one which he 
frankly enjoyed seeing appreciated by others 5 To his mother 
Muller wrote 'The bells have been rung again for me in Oxford, 
for I have, quite unexpectedly, received a fellowship in All Souls 
College I had no idea of it, and the thing has excited great sur- 
prise. A fortnight ago I was asked if I should have any objection if 
I were elected, and the next day I was elected Why they elected me 
I have no idea, it is a great distinction 5 

This unsolicited distinction and kindness evoked a sneaking 
kindness in Max Muller for the old unreformed All Souls which 
elected its Fellows as if they were members of a social club But he 
himself was elected under the new Ordinance which required that 
the Fellows should be chosen according to their merits. 

At all events, he showed very little of the don as a new Fellow 
At the annual Gaudy on All Souls 5 Day he would become the 
German student again, and join with the somewhat tumultuous 
merriment of the younger fellows, and be induced to sing Gaudeamus

Max Muller’s next attempt to secure a higher income and position 
at Oxford, by obtaining the Boden Professorship of Sanskrit, ended 
in a complete failure This was a decisive turning point in his 
scholarly and intellectual life, and for this reason the episode has to

OXFORD— DARK AND BRIGHT 

be narrated fully But the story also illustrates the dark and bright 
Oxford which had become the setting of his life The election to 
this Professorship of Momer Williams instead of Max Muller in 
December i860 was an incident in the long struggle between the 
academic reformers and conservatives, in which the latter, after being 
defeated over the wider question of remodelling the university, won 
a startling incidental victory 

The Professorship was endowed by Lieut- Colonel Joseph Boden 
of the East India Company’s service, who had retired in 1807 and 
died in 1 81 1 He bequeathed all his property, valued roundly at 
.£25,000, ultimately to Oxford to found a Professorship of the 
Sanskrit Language, 'being of opinion that a more general knowledge 
and critical knowledge of the Sanskrit language will be a means of 
enabling his countrymen to proceed in the conversion of the 
Natives of India to the Christian Religion, by disseminating a 
knowledge of the sacred scriptures amongst them, more effectually 
than all other means whatever’ 

The legacy came finally to Oxford at the death of Boden’s 
daughter at the age of mneteen, and after some litigation In 1832 
one of the distinguished early English Sanskritists, Horace Hayman 
Wilson, was appointed to the post As its salary was between £goo 
to £1,000 a year and as it was tenable for life, it was looked upon as a 
very lucrative living at the disposal of the university Certainly 
competition for it would have been much more severe if it had not 
been reserved for a scholar in Sanskrit Thus it happened that over 
about a century the post had only three incumbents Wilson from 
1832 to i860, Momer Williams from i860 to 1899, and Macdonnel 
from 1899 to 1927 Appointment to it was in the hands of the Con- 
vocation, which was to choose the candidate most fitted in its 
judgement to fulfil the post In January 1861 the Convocation had 
3,786 members Thus the election to the Professorship had the 
character of a parliamentary election, and the candidates followed 
the same methods in contesting for the post 

Wilson died on May 8, i860, and the notice of an election to be 
‘holden 5 on December 7 next was issued on May 16 Max Muller 
immediately sent in his application with numerous testimonials, 
and so did Momer Williams Among those who recommended 
Muller were all the noted Orientalists of Europe of the age, digni- 
taries like the Bishop of Calcutta and Raja Radha r anta Deb in 
India, and many leading English ecclesiastical figures, including 



222 SCHOLAR EXTRAORDINARY 

Pusey, Keble, Church and Stanley The supporters of Momer 
Williams equalled in number those of Muller, and included many 
Bengali pundits, but they were not so distinguished For six months 
and more a vigorous election campaign was carried on, with mani- 
festoes, handbills, letters to newspapers and, above all, personal 
canvassing by means of letters and word of mouth Muller had his 
committee, and Momer Williams had two, one at Oxford and the 
other in London In less than a month Muller was sick of the 
business 

There is no doubt that, in a more or less conscious way, Max 
Muller had had his eyes on this post as the culmination of his 
career at Oxford and also as a secure means of pursuing his vocation 
of studying Sanskrit In any case, his friends and fellow-scholars 
had always expected that it would come to him in time 

Before the election took place a supporter of Muller wrote to The 
Times that the difference between the two candidates was the 
'difference between respectable and honourable proficiency, and 
the complete and masterful knowledge of the subject possessed by 
a rare genius and profound scholar, from whose authority on the 
subjects of Indian philology and philosophy there was no appeal in 
Europe 5 This was perfectly true in the light of contemporary repu- 
tation A French Sanskritist kept on declaring, in spite of what 
others were saying, that Muller’s defeat was impossible 

But all this was irrelevant to the question of Muller’s election, 
which was to be swayed by a different consideration — the intention 
of the Founder The paradoxical aspect of the matter was that after 
the rejection of the intentions of the Founders in respect of the 
working of the whole university, the Convocation was being asked 
to respect the intention of a Founder in regard to one Professorship 
The question was thoroughly discussed During the election cam- 
pam both Max Muller and Momer Williams circulated manifestoes 
explaining their respective views on the nature of the Professorship 

Of these, Muller’s was the first and was dated September 3, i860 
He said that if elected it would be his most obvious duty to give 
practical and daily teaching to those who wanted to learn or study 
Sanskrit, but he also pointed out that this alone would be ‘but a 
mean return for the liberality of the Founder of the Chair of San- 
skrit’ He added that a Professor of Sanskrit at Oxford ought to 
lecture on (1) the history and literature of India; (2) the religion and 
philosophy of the Hindus, and (3) Comparative Philology He 



OXFORD— DARK AND BRIGHT 223 

thought that the Boden Professor should create a school of Sanskrit 
Scholarship and Comparative Philology at Oxford 
On the basis of such a definition of the functions of the Professor- 
ship, Momer Williams was ready to concede Muller’s superior 
claim unreservedly But was the definition right ? Williams began 
by saying that before applying for the post he had taken the first 
step of ascertaining what the requirements were for the Professor- 
ship in the exact words of the Founder, and he declared 

Had I found plain instructions that the electors of the University were 
to search throughout Europe for the man most likely to secure a world- 
wide reputation for the Sanskrit Chair, I confess that I should have 
hesitated to prosecute my design But Colonel Boden thought more of 
aiding, by means of Sanskrit, the diffusion of Christianity in India than 
of promoting in all parts of the globe the fame of the Professorship 
The establishment of a school of European comparative philology and 
Indian history, mythology, and philosophy, would doubtless be attrac- 
tive, but such a departure from the one object of the Founder and 
strict province of the Professorship would not, in my opinion, be 
justifiable 

Then he went on to give an analysis of the contents and character 
of Sanskrit literature in order to show which branch of it was most 
important from the Founder’s point of view, and if in so doing he 
also showed that Max Muller’s special studies were irrelevant he 
was not to be blamed, for in what he said he was right 

Williams pointed out that Sanskrit literature could be classified 
under three distinct periods and categories Of these the most 
ancient and the first was the Vedic literature, the second was made 
up of the six systems of Hindu philosophy and the entire collection 
of philosophical writings, and the third comprised the mass of the 
later literature, including the epics, secular poetry and prose, and 
sacred law The Vedic literature, he observed, was not the sacred 
writings used and studied by the contemporary Hindus, and did not 
constitute their scriptures in the sense that the Bible and the Koran 
were Christian and Muslim scriptures. Thus the Rig-Veda (Max 
Muller’s speciality) — which, Williams said, was bemg published at 
an expenditure of time, labour, money and erudition far greater 
than was ever bestowed on any edition of the Bible — was ‘a curious 
monument of a bygone worship, at which the missionary, more 
usefully engaged in studying the present condition of the Hindu 

mind, would content himself with a rapid glance.’

The second class of books, the philosophical texts which Momer 
Williams did not know as well as Max Muller, were according to 
Williams writings of a very abstruse and mystical nature, which 
very few learned natives understood, and which a missionary needed 
to know nothing about beyond their leading principles 

In contrast, it was the third class of Sanskrit books (of which he 
had better knowledge than Muller and on which he had done more 
work), which were the real Sanskrit scriptures, which every mission- 
ary must study if he wished to understand the natives of India and 
be understood by them Moreover, classical Sanskrit, in which these 
books were written and to which Momer Williams had devoted his 
linguistic studies, 'really lived and breathed in the current speech 
of the people’, though nominally dead So, if the missionary had to 
translate the Christian scriptures into the modern Indian languages, 
it was this classical Sanskrit which they had to know, and not Vedic 
Sanskrit, on which Max Muller was the leading authority of the age 
Finally, Momer Williams pointed out, Max Muller’s Sanskrit 
scholarship was of the Continental type, and not attractive to the 
English mmd He had felt that until the study of Sanskrit was in a 
manner anglicized, it would always be nauseous to the English 
palate 'Englishmen, 5 he explained, 'are too practical to study a 
language very philosophically 5 All these arguments, besides being 
patriotic, were also legitimate from the standpoint of the Boden 
Professorship as envisaged by Boden, a pious Colonel of the Indian 
Army. 

If the contest between Max Muller and Momer Williams were 
confined to the airing of antithetical conceptions of the Professor- 
ship, it would have been a sharp academic competition, but not an 
election campaign of the parliamentary type, which is what it be- 
came From the beginning all the spices which make the curry that 
is a parliamentary election were put in it At the end of the cam- 
paign even the ideology of the Professorship was highly emotional- 
ized, and the religious stake involved was explained to the electors

What then is this primary object? 

It is ‘to enable his Countrymen to proceed in the conversion of the 
Natives of India to the Christian Religion, by disseminating a know- 
ledge of the Sacred Scriptures among them’ 

There are Two Candidates, with ample Testimonials 

The Organs of Public Opinion have thought the contest not unworthy 

of their notice 

What then is the result ? 

By common consent both are pronounced scholars of world-wide 
reputation 

But one of them is specially and earnestly recommended to Convoca- 
tion by a great number of our Countrymen in India itself 
These Englishmen , educated by him, grateful for his instruction, and 
personally attached to him, are a machinery existing ready to hand for 
the great work to be done 

They have no Votes to give, but their voice from that distant land 
should ring in our ears and hearts 

They know their man, they know the Natives, they are in daily com- 
munication with them Is it wise to disregard their opinion ? 

The Professorship is not for Oxford alone 
It is not for ‘The Continent and America’ 

It is for India 
It is for Christianity 

Let us then Vote for the man who is well-known and loved in India, 
and who, even by the voice of his opponents, is declared to be a trust- 
worthy depositary of the Christian interests of a Christian Foundation

At once Max Muller’s supporters issued a counterblast in almost 
the same words, but with tell-tale modifications, such as ‘By 
general consent one is pronounced a Scholar of world-wide reputa- 
tion, the other a Scholar well known to his Friends and Pupils * 

But even from the missionary point of view, both Dr Pusey and 
the Bishop of Calcutta wrote in favour of Muller Pusey informed 
Muller that at the time of the first appointment to the Professorship 
m 1832 the question of giving a direct missionary turn to the 
appointment had arisen, and as a voter he had then given weight to 
it On the final notices of the election which he forwarded, he wrote 
m his own hand. ‘Max Muller has already done more for the 
Gospel in India than any other Sanskrit scholar, by opening to the 
missionaries their [the Hindus’] sacred books * 

The Bishop of Calcutta wrote among other things that ‘it would

be more fitting in my opinion for a great Christian University to 
place in its Sanskrit Chair the scholar who has made the Sanskrit 
scriptures accessible to the Christian missionary’ He gave leave to 
Muller to use his letter in any way he considered fit 
After the question of the intention of the Founder, there also 
arose the question of the wishes of the previous holder of the Pro- 
fessorship, as if the principle of apostolic succession was involved in 
the appointment Momer Williams had no difficulty in producing 
decisive proof of his testamentary right With his application he 
submitted the following letter written by Wilson shortly before 
his death 

14 Upper Wimpole Street, April 21, i860 

My dear Williams, I am quite incompetent to give you any hints for 
your industry, for I have been and am suffering dreadfully I am about 
to undergo an operation, and, as there is always a certain amount of 
risk in such an operation at my age, I recommend your being alive to 
the chance of a vacancy I always have looked to you as my successor, 
but you will have a formidable competitor in M Muller, not only for 
his celebrity, but personal influence However, if God be pleased, I 
may get over the trial, and for a few years more keep you in expectancy 
Yours ever affectionately, 

H H Wilson 

Though this was explicit, a friend of Max Muller’s, W S W. 
Vaux of the British Museum, at once raised the question whether 
Wilson could have meant what he said Vaux wrote 

My dear Muller, I was a little surpnsed to read among Williams’s 
testimonials the short note from our late fnend, in which he states 
that he had always looked forward to his succeeding him in the Boden 
Professorship, whenever he should make a vacancy On many occasions 
— and especially on the last time (about two months since, in the East 
India House Library) when I had the pleasure of seeing h im — he 
stated that, in his judgement, you were the first Sansknt scholar in 
Europe I remarked that I was glad to hear him give so decided an 
opinion, as I and several others were naturally anxious that his suc- 
cessor at Oxford should be the fittest man we could procure To this 
he said, ‘You will be quite right if your choice should fall on Max 
Muller ’ 

But on balance it appeared that Wilson was for Williams Even 
as far back as 1830 Wilson had expressed his low opinion of German 
Sanskrit scholars and provoked a controversy with A W Schlegel. 



OXFORD— DARK AND BRIGHT 227 

The campaign also made full use of personal arguments in the 
manner of parliamentary elections, and in respect of them Muller 
was an easier target than Williams He was accused of intending to 
hold two professorships (the Taylonan and the Boden) at the same 
time , of not being an Englishman , of not being able to write English 
well, and of being irreligious To one of these alone he pleaded 
guilty, ‘that of not having been born in England, and having no 
right to the name of an Englishman’ But he added, ‘If, however, 
residence and work in the University give a right to the name of 
Oxfordman, I may, without presumption, be thought to have 
acquired some claim to that title ’ All the other charges he rejected 
totally, and especially the charge of being irreligious 

As to his English, a friend (who remained unknown) wrote to 
The Times ‘Mr Max Muller’s English is perfect Many who have 
not heard the wonderful force and clearness of his public lectures 
must have read, without knowing it, some of his many contributions 
to periodical literature ’ 

At the very height of the campaign Muller was accused of mis- 
representing Williams in his reply in The Times to the latter’s 
manifesto by misquoting ‘some of his statements in a manner preju- 
dicial to his interests’ Max Muller, who was very sensitive to any 
charge of dishonesty, immediately submitted the matter to four 
distinguished members of the university, who reported as follows. 

We the undersigned, having examined Mr Momer Williams’s Circu- 
lar of October 12, and Mr Max Muller’s Letter of October 23, beg 
leave to state that we consider the charge brought against Mr Max 
Muller, in Mr Momer Williams’s Circular just issued, of having ‘mis- 
quoted’ Mr Momer Williams in a manner prejudicial to his interests, 
to be wholly unfounded 

William Thomson, Provost of Queen’s, 

E B Pusey, Regius Professor of Hebrew, 

William Jacobson, Regius Professor of Divinity, 
Mountague Bernard, Chichele Professor of 
International Law and Diplomacy 

But the game was not all one-sided, and at some moments 
Williams too must have felt both awkward and stung 

There was for instance an attack on Momer Williams on the 
score of his incompetence on the external side of Sanskrit scholar- 
ship It was put about that he could not read a Sanskrit manuscript 



228 SCHOLAR EXTRAORDINARY 

To dispro\e that some evidence was produced, and to this Max 
Muller’s supporters replied as follows 

The extracts given by the Master of University and Mr Medd merely 
prove that Mr Williams is able to recognize the letters of a Sanskrit 
MS when he can compare it with an existing text This is a kind of 
mechanical labour which is paid for at the public libraries at Pans and 
Berlin at the rate of half-a-crown an hour Mr Williams has yet to prove 
that he can take a Sanskrit author existing in MS only and give him to 
the world for the first time 

From Williams’s side a complaint came that some of Muller’s 
supporters had improved on this charge in one of the circulars by 
putting this comment on a circular 'The eyes of Europe are on our 
election Shall we elect a man who is great as a Sanskrit scholar, 
philologist, and teacher, or one who cannot read a Sanskrit MS 
It was in this atmosphere of hustings that the election for the 
Professorship was held on December 7, i860 The voting was 833 
for Momer Williams and 610 for Max Muller The defeat was a 
severe disappointment to Muller and his friends, and they all held 
that the scales were tipped against him on irrelevant personal, 
religious and political grounds Muller himself wrote to his mother 
‘The opposite party made it a political and religious question, and 
nothing could be done against them All the best people voted for 
me, the Professors almost unanimously, but the vulgus profanum 
made the majority ’ His father-in-law expressed himself very 
strongly ‘I know not when I have felt more deeply for the trials of 
others or had more reason to admire patience and resignation to 
God’s will than in the spirit you have shown, in what I know to be 
a most severe trial and bitter disappointment But now that all is 
over, and I have time to think, I am inclined to believe that with 
such unscrupulous opponents we could not have won ’ 

But the noblest comfort for him came from Stanley 

I have never experienced [he wrote] the peculiar trial under which you 
are suffering, but I believe, from my own bitter disappomtment on 
your behalf, I can feel what it is for you You will have many consola- 
tions, I need not dwell upon them But you must also give us the best 
consolation that we can have, and that is the assurance that we have not 
been mistaken in the high expectations we had formed of you You 
can still show that, although not Boden Professor, you are and will

remain the oracle of all who wish to know 7 the secrets of Indian litera- 
ture and religion 

Stanley, through sheer spiritual sympathy, had already anticipated 
the course Muller’s intellectual efforts were to take 

After Max Muller’s death two friends wrote to his wife explaining 
the reason for his failure to get the Professorship One of them was 
Canon Farrar, who was a member of his committee Fie said that he 
was inclined to think that the opposition to him was not strictly 
religious or political, but it sprang from 'the Englishman’s dislike 
to an adopted son’ He added that Muller did 'not realize the stub- 
born fixedness of English and Oxford preference for an old Oxford 
man’ But the other informant, W B Gamlen, told Mrs Max 
Muller that on the strength of the version of the affair given to him 
by 'Tommy’ Sheppard of Exeter, who was one of the leaders of the 
Oxford Tories, the verdict was entirely political As he put it T 
should judge that the same opposition would have been offered to 
any candidate, whether an Englishman or foreigner, who could have 
been identified with the liberal, or Gladstoman party ’ 

There can be no doubt that both personal and public reasons lay 
behind Max Muller’s defeat 

His next move to have a share in the flesh-pots of Oxford suc- 
ceeded, though not without some characteristically Oxonian oppo- 
sition In October 1865 Max Muller applied for the post of the 
Oriental Sub-Librarian at the Bodleian, finding that his friend 
Coxe, who was the Librarian, could not secure the services of any 
other Orientalist With the unammous consent of the curators his 
name was forwarded for consideration by the Convocation, and the 
date of the election was announced At once letters began to appear 
m the press against him and for another aspirant 

A formal contradiction to some of the statements made was 
issued by Coxe himself as the Bodleian’s Librarian He asserted 
that 'it may be as well to correct three mis-statements which appear 
m the first of the letters now under circulation Professor Muller’s 
salary as Taylonan Professor is -£500, not "more than j£6oo” He has 
resigned the Exammership for the Indian Civil Service. His labours 
m editing the Vedas , so far from being "well paid”, entail on him a 
considerable pecumary sacrifice ’ 

However, this time Muller was elected, and he enjoyed the work 
very much. But the double work proved too much for his health, 



230 SCHOLAR EXTRAORDINARY 

and he resigned the sub-librarianship after about a year and a half, 
In 1868 the university on its own initiative recognized the merits of 
Max Muller in a striking manner It abolished the Taylonan Pro- 
fessorship of Modem European Languages, and created in its place 
expressly for him a new chair of Comparative Philology on a higher 
salary This was the first professorship created by the university 
itself All the previous professorships were established either by 
royal benefactions or private endowments This relieved Muller of 
the duty of lecturing on the European languages, and left him free 
to pursue his own subject 

For the next eight years Max Muller’s life and career at Oxford 
ran smoothly But at the end of 1875 he himself raised a storm about 
his career at Oxford, and on December 1 sent in his resignation of 
the Professorship of Comparative Philology to the Vice-Chancellor 
At the same time he also printed the letter of resignation in a cir- 
cular, and distributed it so that his friends, both inside and outside 
the umversity, might know why after long consideration he had 
taken the step His mam and declared reason was that he wanted 
leisure to pursue his Indian and Sanskritic studies In his letter of 
resignation he said that he had to choose between Sanskrit and Com- 
parative Philology, and he repeated that explanation in a personal 
letter to the Duke of Albany, one of Queen Victoria’s sons 

If I had continued to discharge my duties as Professor of Comparative 
Philology, I should have had to surrender my Sanskrit studies alto- 
gether Were I Professor of Sanskrit at Oxford, nothing would have 
drawn me away from this, in many respects, delightful place , but in 
order to concentrate my powers, and to do something at least before it 
is too late, I see no choice but to give up my pleasant position here, and 
retire to some quiet town in Germany 

None of his friends questioned the reasonableness of his decision 
on this ground, though all of them regretted it 
As soon as the news spread, letters began to pour in from all parts 
of the world, and even from India 

There was no doubt that Muller was sincere in giving this reason 
for his resignation But there was much more behind it than was 
publicly stated For some years he had been feeling a very strong 
emotional revulsion from Oxford, and for a few months before he 
had actually decided to leave it he had written quite frankly to his 



OXFORD— DARK AND BRIGHT 231 

intimate friends about his dissatisfaction For instance, on August 
22 he wrote to Stanley 

I think my time in England is nearly up I doubt whether I ought to 
stay longer I am only tolerated at Oxford, allowed to help when I am 
wanted, but never helped myself when I want help If I had worked 
m Germany as I have worked for twenty-frve years in England, my 
position would be very different Here I am nobody in the University, 
and when I see how I am treated, I really feel sometimes ashamed of 
myself, not for my own, but for my wife’s sake 

He felt he was at Oxford only on sufferance That this mood 
was also’ behind his resignation he admitted to his friend George 
von Bunsen, son of his old patron and helper, in a letter written in 
January 1876, in which he said ‘I will tell you viva voce why I 
have finally made up my mind to leave Oxford Clerical intrigues 
and petty jealousies, alas* were partly the reason ’ 

Even this was not the whole story What brought his sense of 
grievance against Oxford to a head and finally induced him to act 
was a particular personal matter — the decision of the Hebdomeda! 
Council to put up the name of Momer Williams to the Convocation 
for the honorary degree of d c l This was the only time in his whole 
career that Max Muller acted from personal pique, which showed 
that though intellectually he had outgrown his disappointment over 
the Boden Professorship, it still rankled in his mmd emotionally 
The decision to give the degree to Momer Williams was in itself 
an exhibition of the mores of academic Oxford Towards the end of 
the summer term of 1875 the friends of Williams in the Council 
applied to it to propose a decree which would enable him to have 
the formal degree of dcl without passing the examination for it 
The Council agreed and put forward a draft decree of exoneration 
As soon as it was published in the University Gazette the Uni- 
versity Professor of Law made a solemn remonstrance that such a 
step would overthrow the whole fabric of legal studies which had 
been laboriously erected and by which an Oxford degree in law had 
been recognized by the Inns of Court If, he said, this degree was 
now conferred without an examination on a person ignorant of law 
the university would stultify itself But this argument, the Law 
Faculty added, did not apply to an honorary dcl, because it was 
well known that the honour was conferred annually on all sorts of 
persons and implied no legal qualifications in the recipient 



232 SCHOLAR EXTRAORDINARY 

The Council admitted the force of the argument and cancelled 
the session of the Convocation Williams's friends at once declared 
that this v ould be regarded as a stigma on him, for all the world had 
come to know that a degree was intended, and they even said that 
the stigma would be out of all proportion to the distinction which 
the degree would have given him Then the Council decided to 
propose the honorary degree of dcl, and proceeded with the 
matter This was regarded as a personal slight by Max Muller, 
and at the beginning of November he told his friends that he was 
going to resign 

At this juncture his friends to a man showed themselves to be 
his real friends All of them disapproved of his decision, though 
they were ready to consider his other and mam motive, securing 
greater leisure for his work His brother-in-law Walrond wrote 
strongly to him T don't think you have any idea what a bad effect 
it would have For one man who would give you credit for indigna- 
tion in a sacred cause, the cause of real learmng against the shallow 
pretence of it, a hundred would accuse you of petty personal 
jealousy And what a triumph your enemies will have then 1 ' 
Stanley wrote Tf you have on general grounds determined that 
you ought to pass your remaining years (and, oh* may they be 
many!) in Germany, much as I shall regret it I shall have nothing 
to say against it But that you should leave Oxford on the ground 
that an undeserved honour has been bestowed on Momer Williams 
seems to be both insufficient in itself and unjust to yourself 9 Dean 
Liddell, as soon as he heard about Max Muller's intention from 
Rolleston, wrote to him* 

It grieves me much to hear you say that in M really contemplates 
resignation It appears to me that he, at once, greatly overrates the 
importance of the thing itself and greatly underrates his own position 
and character . . I am as sure that it will not occur to anyone 
that any slur will be cast on in M because the Council has rashly and 
undeservedly lavished an empty honour on in W MM stands far too 
high If, on the other hand, he should resign, I know my country- 
men well enough to feel sure that he will be generally blamed and that 
his conduct will be set down to petulance You and I would feel 
too much interested in him not to dread this for his sake and to wish it 
averted, if averted it can be 

A few days later Liddell wrote to Muller himself in the same 



OXFORD— DARK AND BRIGHT 233 

vein, and urged him to put off the resignation even if it were on 
general grounds Other friends also wrote to him All this showed 
that Muller’s fancy that he was only tolerated at Oxford was due to 
his own temperament which created these passing fits of impatience 
Anyhow, when he did resign on the general ground of work, they 
all set about doing something for him which would enable him to 
pursue his vocation without being encumbered by the duties of 
the Professorship The idea was to relieve him of the burden of 
lecturing on Comparative Philology by giving him a Deputy who 
would do that work, and to give him the status of a Professor 
Emeritus Even Lord Salisbury, as Secretary of State for India, took 
up the matter, and on January 27 Liddell wrote to Muller T have 
just received a “private” letter from Lord Salisbury, in which he 
expresses a warm desire on the part both of himself and of the India 
Council that you may be induced to remain at Oxford and in which 
he says that there “seems to be no objection in principle to the India 
Council co-operating with the University to incur the cost of pub- 
lishing the ‘Indian Works’ which are mentioned in your list” ’ He 
also informed Muller that on Monday next he hoped to bring for- 
ward a proposal which might not be unsatisfactory to him This 
proposal was put into the form of a decree to be approved by the 
Convocation on February 15 and circulated by the Vice-Chancellor 
on January 31, 1876 It ran as follows 

Whereas it is expedient to allow Professor in Muller to devote himself 
without interruption to the studies on the Ancient Literature of India 
which he has hitherto prosecuted with so much success and with so 
much honour to the University; In a CONVOCATION to be 
holden on Tuesday, February 15, at Two o’clock, the following form 
of Decree will be submitted to the House — ‘That the provisions of 
Statt Tit IV, Sect 1, 37, cl 3 be suspended, and that the Electors 
proceed to the nomination of A Deputy to be approved by the Vice- 
Chancellor, and the Deputy shall receive one half of the salary of the 
present Professor 5 

Even so the author of Alice in Wonderland brought into play 
against the proposal the devastating logic exhibited in his fantasy 
He said that the deputy would be the real professor, and the retiring 
Professor would really get a pension, that the two were wholly 
independent questions , that the university should be able to provide 
the pension without mulcting the real professor of half of his

income All this, he said, he was writing in the interest of the un- 
known future holder of the Chair, though also in the interest of 
Max Muller, ‘for surely the very proposal to invite the new Pro- 
fessor to do the work for half the present salary, is to say, by impli- 
cation, that the work has been hitherto overpaid — against which 
suspicion I, for one, desire to record my protest’ 

But the Convocation found the logic — sound as it was — unper- 
suasive, and the decree was carried, Jowett spoke in favour of it, 
and Liddell made a reasoned appeal in a long speech, with an 
eloquent peroration 

Other Governments have acknowledged Professor Max Muller’s great 
achievements, the French Institute several 3^ ears ago elected him a 
Foreign Member, the Royal Academy of Turin paid him the same 
honour, and made him one of a distinguished six, the others being 
Cousin, Thiers, Bockh, Mommsen, and Grote He received the Cross 
of the Order of Merit from the German Emperor two years ago, along 
with von Moltke England has been behindhand Let Oxford by a 
unanimous vote today do something to repair this backwardness , not 
for his sake, but for our own, I ask it Let us keep him if we can, how 
we can, while we can 

Max Muller was informed of the decision and wrote to the Vice- 
Chancellor in the most grateful terms, saying that he looked for- 
ward with great satisfaction to spending the remaimng years of his 
life at Oxford * 

On hearing of it Froude wrote gladly. ‘My dear Max, 

Two words only to express my hearty delight that all is well 
settled and that we are to be spared the dishonour of losing you 9 
And just as Mohere said that la comedie ftmt par un petit ballet 
qm avoit ete prepare, the University Musical Club sent Max Muller 
the following invitation and message 

The President ventures to invite Professor Max Muller’s attention to 
this evening’s programme, and to express to him the very great 
pleasure it would give the Club if he were able to be present this 
evening 

* The post of Deputy Professor went to Archibald Henry Sayce, in A , at the 
time Fellow of Queen’s, an Orientalist and philologist, who became a leading 
Assynologist later The salary of the Professorship was £600 a year So the 
Deputy got £300

At the same time he wishes to congratulate the Professor most 
heartily on the result of yesterday’s Convocation, and to express his 
great regret that anyone should have thought it their duty to oppose 
the proposition of the Council 
The programme will include 
Mozart’s Clarinet Quintet,

Chapter i 

POLEMICS POLITICAL AND SCHOLARLY 


In his conscious formulation of an ideal of life Max Muller wanted 
to be a studious recluse, seeking knowledge and truth for their own 
sake, and believing that there must be a division of labour in human 
activities 

None the less, all through life he was involving himself in political 
controversies, and showing himself eager to fight the opinions of 
majorities when they were baying in a pack out of nationalistic 
passions This was due to his interest in politics As a student in 
Germany he was a liberal nationalist As an adult scholar in England 
he remained the same liberal, and associated with the English 
Liberals At no age did he shrink from expressing his opinions in 
conversation or correspondence Though the realization of German 
unity and the creation of the German Empire in 1870 satisfied his 
nationalism, he never ceased to take an interest in Anglo-German 
friendship in the international field Even in his letters to his young 
son he set down his political views very freely 

But his interest in politics did not remain confined to private 
expression As soon as he had acquired sufficient standing in the 
scholarly world he began to intervene in the public discussion of all 
the burning political questions of his times He was also given a 
hearing, for celebrity flows out through all sorts of outlets But it 
was not the desire for personal publicity which made him do so He 
felt that it was his duty to support the side which he believed to be 
right, and in committing himself to a cause he showed neither 
timidity nor half-heartedness, though this brought him more than 
a controversialist’s share of abuse. 

But in the first instance he was only the typical German scholar 
of the mneteenth century After the French Revolution and the 
Romantic Movement, which between them created a new form of 
nationalism, a life like that of Kant became impossible for a Euro- 
pean philosopher or scholar, because this nationalism put an end 
to the specialized, restricted and calculating manifestation of 
politics, and based it on the passion for selfhood of a whole people 

Moreover, there stood behind that a far older Western tradition 



240

of involvement in public affairs Plato created the political function, 
both theoretical and practical, of the thinker Before him the 
Athenians had begun to think that a man who took no interest in 
the affairs of thcpohs was not just a harmless man, but a useless man 
Since that time nobody in the West has disputed that the scholar 
and also the poet, the philosopher and the historian, have their 
practical role in politics But till the end of the nineteenth century 
the political intervention of the writer was almost without exception 
on the side of right, and never on the side of might, whereas from 
the end of the mneteenth century onwards the perversion of the 
political function of the intellectual was an accompaniment of the 
perversion of its driving force, nationalism 

Max Muller’s interventions in politics conformed to the older 
tradition in Europe Even so he seemed to think that a justification 
for them was called for, and once he wrote ‘If you want to be at 
peace with yourself, do not mind being at war with the world ’ 

In the course of his life Muller was drawn into public controversy 
by three wars the Schleswig-Holstein War of 1864 between Den- 
mark and the German Confederation, but fought on its behalf by 
Austria and Prussia, the Franco-Prussian War of 1870, and the 
Boer War of 1899. 

As a German nationalist he held that the two Duchies of Schleswig 
and Holstein were German So, when they were annexed by Den- 
mark in 1850 and Prussia did nothing to prevent that, he wrote to 
Bunsen. c God help Schleswig-Holstein, and not punish Prussia in 
His wrath But if a power, to which all Europe has offered the 
leading position, allows itself to be intimidated by the threats of the 
Danes and Russians, and withdraws a given promise, that is worse 
than a retreat before a battle ’ 

The status of the two Duchies became an issue of war again when 
King Frederick VII of Denmark died at the end of 1863 The new 
king laid claim to them, but the German Confederation rejected 
his claim and called upon Austria and Prussia to take military 
action against Denmark They did, and of course the defeat of the 
Danes was inevitable 

In England feeling ran high against Germany The Queen herself 
was pro-German, but her ministers and people were inflamed 
against Austria and Prussia There was even talk of war, and 
Palmerston himself would have liked it Almost all the newspapers 
were wholly on the side of Denmark At this juncture Max Muller 



POLEMICS POLITICAL AND SCHOLARLY 241 

thought he would explain the German case, and try to remove the 
grave misunderstanding between the German and the English 
people 

On February 15, 1864, he sent a long letter to The Times from 
Oxford The editor, Delane, wrote to inform him that he would 
publish it, though he and his paper supported Denmark The com- 
munication was published on February 18, accompanied by an 
editorial which expressed lack of conviction Muller feared that 
public clamour might at any moment carry England into a war with 
Germany, and that, he said, would be the most terrible misfortune 
As for the English attitude, he understood it ‘The sympathy felt for 
Denmark as the weaker Power/ he said, ‘is both natural and 
honourable But weakness, as has been well said, does not confer 
the divine right of doing wrong, and in this conflict between Den- 
mark and Germany, Denmark has been in the wrong from begin- 
ning to end ’ 

Then followed what Delane described as Muller’s elaborate 
defence of the conduct of Germany towards Denmark But on the 
larger public in England it fell flat 

Yet his views were moderate He upheld the right to independence 
of the Duchies, and disapproved of the highhandedness of Bis- 
marck He said ‘They are sovereign and independent states and 
are indissolubly united ’ But this question was not as simple as he 
made it out to be In fact, it was discussed in law for a long time and 
was set as a question in examination papers His advocacy of the 
German claim pursued him not only to the end of his life, but even 
after his death 

He himself revived it in an article published in the Nineteenth 
Century ra its May 1897 issue In substance he made it a restatement 
of the German case The Editor of the review published it with the 
following note ‘The subjoined article has been submitted to and 
approved by the highest possible authority upon the facts, who 
vouches for the correctness of this version of them 5 

The challenge was at once taken up by a Danish historian, A D. 
Jorgensen, who was also Keeper of the State Archives of Denmark 
He flatly denied the impartiality of Muller and observed that 
Muller had derived most of his information from the University of 
Kiel, ‘the headquarters’, as he put it, ‘of all the seditious writings 
against Denmark/ The Editor of the Nineteenth Century published 
this rejoinder in the December number of his review, and to it also 



242 SCHOLAR EXTRAORDINARY 

he added an explanatory note ‘The following reply to Professor 
Max Muller’s article in the May number of this Review is published 
at the desire of an exalted Personage in this country, interested in 
the Danish side of the question, who considers that Professor Max 
Muller’s views are incorrect and inconsistent with historic truth 9 
The Personage could only have been Alexandra, Princess of Wales, 
or her husband the future Edward VII 
Even this was not the end of the matter In November 1915, 
both the articles were republished as a pamphlet in London, with a 
preface by K Lmdblom It was a piece of war propaganda against 
Germany, but the moral drawn in the preface was incontrovertible 

The Powers [Lmdblom wrote] who acted neither honourably nor 
wisely — the same thing if people only had knowledge to see it — have 
since had cause bitterly to regret their passivity Some may look on 
what the Great Powers have suffered since in the light of retribution 
1864 shows what could well have been realized in 1914, namely, 
that a war in Europe, however small, is not merely somebody’s but 
everybody’s concern 

1864 shows that it is easy to see injustice done and difficult to re- 
dress it Knowledge of injustice in the past and its consequences 
may help to the avoidance of injustice in the future Hence the repub- 
kcation of the following articles, of which the net proceeds of sales 
will go to the Red Cross societies of the Allies 

The long-drawn-out causality hinted at by the writer is indisput- 
able if the fundamental cause of the First World War is assumed to 
be the very foundation of the German Empire To Bismarck the 
Schleswig War was the first trial of a method which he was to use 
with ever greater confidence and thoroughness in order to unite 
Germany under the hegemony of Prussia Eventually Max Muller 
recognized it himself, although during the war he condemned the 
action of Bismarck and the annexation of Schleswig-Holstein to 
Germany As his wife related in her biography ‘In later years he 
saw that Bismarck’s policy with regard to the Duchies was the first 
link in the chain that led to the unity of Germany ’ And Muller 
himself explained the connexion very clearly in his article pub- 
lished in 1897 

There can be no doubt [he wrote] that without the initiative taken by 
Duke Frederick and the people of Schleswig-Holstein in resisting the 
Danish claim the great events of the second half of our century, the 



POLEMICS POLITICAL AND SCHOLARLY 243 


war between Prussia and Austria, and the subsequent war between 
Germany and France, would never have taken place, at all events not 
under the very peculiar circumstances in which they actually took 
place The name of Zundholzchen , lucifer match, given at the time to 
Schleswig-Holstein, has proved very true, though the conflagration 
which it caused has been far greater than could ha\ e been foreseen at 
the time 

But the end of this war, which left the Duchies divided in control 
between Austria and Prussia, did not set at rest Muller’s anxiety 
about them He still awaited a final settlement, and tried to interest 
Gladstone in it Thus on April 2, 1865, he wrote to that statesman 
But obviously nothing came out of it The next year the status of the 
Duchies was finally decided by force by Bismarck, and that led to 
the war between Prussia on the one hand and Austria and the South 
German States on the other This was the second step in the process 
of realizing German unity under Prussia 

In this conflict Muller’s convictions and sympathies were wholly 
with Prussia But he refrained from giving public expression to 
them He did not think it binding on him to declare himself pub- 
licly as a partisan of one of the two German States which were at 
war with each other Nevertheless, he wrote frankly to his mother 
and, while offering his view of the conflict, he also set down his 
anticipations for Germany In both he was remarkably correct On 
June 17, one day before the formal declaration of war by Prussia 
on Austria, he wrote to her 

Sooner or later a war between Austria and Prussia was unavoidable, 
and if it is decisive, it will lead to what all true Germans have desired 
for years, a united Germany Prussia and Austria are merely names, 
and stand for no more than Anhalt and Reuss The great thing is that 
the dualism of Prussia and Austria should be ended Who conquers, or 
is conquered, is of little consequence Germany remains Germany, and 
cannot be governed, even by a Roman Catholic Emperor, otherwise 
than she allows herself to be governed If Prussia wins, she must cease 
to be Prussia, Austna the same So wait quietly, no excitement, no 
partisanship. 

He reassured his mother about the practical consequences of the 
war for her Her investments were in Austrian stocks, and they had 
fallen So he told her that she must not scruple to ask him for money, 
for, as he put it, ‘if I don’t give you, I give to others’

After the battle of Komggratz he wrote again 

All good Germans have long desired what is now happening The 
methods employed might have been better, here and there, but 
Prussia staked her existence to make Germany united and strong, and 
though I thoroughly doubt whether the motives were throughout 
honest and pure yet I rejoice over the results Prussia will have a yet 
harder war to wage, for a war with France can hardly be avoided But 
m spite of all that, Germany will at last take her right place in Europe, 
and that she never could have done with the Bundestag and thirty 
princes 

This war made him forget a good deal of the dislike which as a 
German liberal he felt for Bismarck's authoritarianism, and even 
made him regard that statesman as a possible benefactor of Ger- 
many He wrote to his mother on July 16 4 You can well imagine 
I am no admirer of Bismarck, but I am convinced that his policy 
is the only one to make Germany strong and respected by other 
nations 5 

About the final outcome for Austria Max Muller offered to his 
mother consolation in a fatalistic vein ‘One cannot alter matters, 
and when you think that Babylon and Nineveh, and Athens and 
Rome, have passed away in the course of time, you cannot wonder 
so much at the Hapsburg catastrophe.’ One wonders, however, if 
instead of Austria Prussia had suffered a resounding defeat, whether 
he would have been so philosophical. 

Max Muller’s next involvement in current politics was over the 
Franco-Prussian War It moved him heart and soul This war 
roused the German nationalist that lay dormant in his scholar’s 
personality Being divided between Germany and England also he 
could not forget the issue of Anglo- German understanding, and this 
gave him as much concern during the war as the cause of German 
unity 

On July 17, 1870, even before the formal declaration of war by 
France, he wrote to his mother. T do not for a moment doubt the 
result Germany may lose some battles, but Germany cannot be 
killed. The present devil’s brood in France will fall after one lost 
battle. There is perhaps nothing better for the ultimate consolida- 
tion of Germany than this war , Who knows how long this war 
may last? I should like to live to see its end 1 ’ He was only forty- 
seven * 



POLEMICS POLITICAL AND SCHOLARLY 245 
He wrote to Stanley 

My heart is too full to say anything about this terrible war I believe 
it is a cup that could not pass France cannot break a united and strong 
Germany , and the reckless gambler who usurps the throne of France 
took advantage of this national jealousy to save himself from his in- 
evitable end for a few years longer But the misery it bangs to thou- 
sands of happy homes passes all description * This war can only end 
either in the destruction of Germany, or in a revenge without parallel 
m history 

He rebutted in advance any plea that might come from Stanley to 
show no vindictiveness to a beaten enemy ‘War in Germany is 
different from war in England It was easy for the Duke of Welling- 
ton to preach moderation at Paris He had to avenge defeat, but no 
outrages, whilst every German soldier that marches into Pans (and 
I trust I shall live to see it ! ) has to avenge the blood of brothers, 
and tears such as only a mother can shed 5 

That reveals nationalism as an amoral biological phenomenon, 
which can make nations faced with a threat to their independent 
existence as blindly fierce as a wild beast at bay. But in Max 
Muller’s age this ferocity burst out in periodical crises It had not 
solidified into a persistent human hatred (called ‘cold war’ in modern 
jargon) which can contemplate and plan in cold blood the annihila- 
tion of a rival human group Thus, as soon as the tide of war turned, 
Muller’s tone became different On August 14 , even before the 
battles of Vionville, Mars-la-Tour, St Pnvat and Gravelotte were 
fought — and these French defeats decided the war — he wrote to his 
mother. ‘You can fancy all our thoughts are with Germany, and I 
wish I were there Such a triumph of a good cause has seldom been 
seen in history.’ On the same day, he wrote to his historian friend 
Freeman’ ‘Though I never doubted of ultimate success, I was 
afraid of reverses in the beginning Now I expect the war will be 
over soon, and what I looked forward to for the last eighteen years 
almost everyday as I opened the paper — the downfall of the Empire 
— has come to pass at last Peace will be easy, for Germany wants 
no conquests, not even Alsace and Lorraine , the land is fine enough, 
but the people are not worth having 9 He was soon to form different 
views about these provinces 

Even then his mood was not wholly one of triumph The follow- 
ing passage from bus letter to Stanley written just on the eve of 



246 SCHOLAR EXTRAORDINARY 

Sedan, on August 30, reveal the mingling of nationalism and 
humamtarianism in him T cannot tell you how this war crushes 
me I sometimes feel as I could bear it no longer and must be off 
What savages we are in spite of all these centuries 1 But surely the 
Teutonic race is better than the Latin and the Slavonic, and the 
Protestants better Christians than the Romans , and the Germanic 
cause is surely thoroughly righteous, and the French thoroughly 
unrighteous 5 

It would be easy to label Muller as a German chauvinist But it was 
not in Muller’s nature to be partisan, though he always chose what 
m his lights was right So he wrote to his mother after the defeat of 
France T cannot agree with the German abuse of the French 
nation The French as a nation fight bravely, and show that they 
are by no means so depraved and perishing as the writers in the 
German papers think 5 

Soon after he also wrote to Gladstone T feel quite ashamed when 
I see German writers speak of the whole of France as one vast 
Babylon, implying at the same time that Heaven has granted to us 
the exclusive privilege of all virtue and godliness ’ 

In spite of being a German and his complete identification with 
the German cause, Muller showed himself to be less of a partisan 
than Carlyle, who concluded a long letter to The Times (November 
11, 1870) with the words ‘That noble, patient, deep, pious, and 
solid Germany should at length be welded into a nation and become 
Queen of the Continent, instead of vapouring, vainglorious, gesti- 
culating, quarrelsome, restless, and over-sensitive France, seems to 
me the hopefullest public fact that has occurred in my time * 

In a letter to his friend Professor Bernays, Max Muller even spoke 
regretfully of the respect with which the world was now treating 
victorious Germany ‘I feel with you,’ he wrote, ‘the horrors of this 
time, and though I am so proud of the heroism of the German 
nation, I am nevertheless ashamed to think how often the world 
looked upon the great spiritual victories of the Fatherland with 
scorn and indifference, and now is on her knees because we have 
learnt to aim our bullets with accuracy and skill However, I trust 
that the wild beast will soon retire, and that the spirit in Germany 
will attain the upper hand ’ 

For the sake of the mental sanity of the German people he wished 
France to remain strong, and not to be permanently weakened He 
wrote on September 16, 1870, to his American friend Moncure 



POLEMICS POLITICAL AND SCHOLARLY 247 

Conway, who was reporting the war T doubt whether it is w lse to 
weaken France at the very moment that Germany becomes so much 
more powerful As to making France harmless, that can never be 
done, and I doubt whether for the sake of Germany it is desirable * 

Naturally Max Muller's wife w T as pro- German, and he informed 
his mother that ‘G [Georgina] is e\en more German than I am’, 
and also told Abeken that ‘she is German through and through, and 
she and my three girls, the youngest only six years old, w T ork mde- 
fatigably for the wounded 5 But though Muller’s anxiety in regard 
to the outcome of the war was over, a new 7 cause of anxiety arose 
for him in the signs that he observed of a misunderstanding be- 
tween England and Germany 

He was bound to wush for wholehearted friendship between the 
English and the German people But he went even further and 
thought that the peace of the world could only be preserved by 
creating an alliance of the Teutomc Powers, among whom he in- 
cluded the United States ‘My great anxiety through all this war/ 
he wrote to Gladstone on October 6, 1870, ‘has been the unfriendly 
feeling that is springing up between England and Germany The 
whole future of the world seems to me to depend on the friendship 
of the three Teutomc nations, Germany, England, and America 5 
He looked upon France and Russia as the potential disturbers of 
peace, and set down the idea of an Anglo-German alliance to 
counteract them 

Already in England a deep suspicion of Germany was taking 
shape At first sympathy in England was for Germany as the 
attacked side, but with the German victories there came about a 
change There w r ere some eminent British intellectuals who were 
wholly pro-German, such as Carlyle, the historian Freeman, and 
the political writer Goldwm Smith John Stuart Mill supported 
Germany from his antipathy to Napoleon III, and at first Glad- 
stone, as Muller reported to Abeken, was on the German side, ‘not 
from natural sympathy, but from a conviction, from a feeling of 
right and duty 5 

The British attitude began to be reversed after Sedan At the 
beginning of this change of opimon Max Muller wrote to his 
mother ‘The best part of the nation was for Germany, but the 
Anstocracy has strong sympathy with France 5 This change was 
partly the expression of the familiar British inclination to sympa- 
thize with the weaker side, but was also due to the tendency to 
9 



248 SCHOLAR EXTRAORDINARY 

be intolerant of the successes, especially military, of other nations 
Soon the disapproval of Prussia became quite vocal The idea 
gamed ground that France, instead of being the aggressor without 
qualification, might have been manoeuvred into that role by the 
astuteness of Bismaick, for whom there was great dislike in English 
political circles This found its first public and very strong expres- 
sion in a letter to The Times written by Sir Harry Verney and pub- 
lished on August 29, 1870 In it the writer accused Bismarck of 
complicity in a design put forward by France to partition Holland, 
Belgium and Switzerland between the two as a quid pro quo for a 
French acceptance of the unity of Germany under Prussian hege- 
mony Sir Harry Verney charged Prussia and Bismarck with enter- 
taining this scheme, and said that 'an English Minister who could 
dishonour his country by listening for a moment to such proposals, 
would be driven from office by an indignant people* 

Max Muller at once replied, denying that the acceptance of the 
document by Bismarck in any way implied his agreement with the 
proposals But on the very next day (July 26) he wrote to Stanley 
'I feel by no means quite happy about the Traite de paix entre la 
France et la Prusse If it is genuine, however, then neutrality on the 
part of England would be criminal * Afterwards he contended that 
though Bismarck kept the document he was not in collusion with 
France But the mam contention of Sir Harry Verney was that 
Prussia and Bismarck had aggressive designs already prepared and 
so were responsible for the war This Muller disputed, and declared 
that Prussia was only fighting a purely defensive war 

But Max Muller’s task became more difficult when Prussia dis- 
closed the obvious intention of taking Alsace and Lorraine from 
France British opinion, and still more that of Gladstone, turned 
sharply against Germany At the beginning of October Gladstone, 
then Prime Minister, himself wrote to Muller conveying his strong 
view that he could not approve of the annexation of Alsace-Lorraine 
by Germany, and seeking more information on its possibility But 
it was not easy to justify the German intention, and Muller had to 
admit that ‘the conquest of territory inhabited by people that are 
not German in national sentiment is an idea repugnant to the 
German mind’ He himself had at first thought that Prussia would 
make no such demand But he could see that it would be made and 
the cession exacted So he had to justify the step on the ground of 
military security 



POLEMICS POLITICAL AND SCHOLARLY 249 

He also knew, however, that there was more in the German 
claim on Alsace-Lorraine than military security He informed 
Gladstone that these provinces once belonged to Germany, and that 
had never been forgotten by the German people But he added that 
any offensive war to recover the lost patrimony was impossible. 
Only the action of France had provided the opportunity He now 
supported the claim, and in his letter even w T ent to the length of 
saying that hf there are people in the annexed portions of Alsace 
and Lorraine who cannot bear the idea of belonging to Germany, 
surely it is not too much to expect from their patriotism that they 
should follow the example of thousands of German families which 
emigrated to Philadelphia when Alsace was annexed to France’ 

The correspondence with Gladstone continued, and Muller even 
had one prolonged meeting with him at Hawarden But in the 
meanwhile he involved himself in a controversy in The Times on 
the whole subject 

A long letter, his second on the w r ar, was called forth by an appeal 
made to England by a French merchant-politician, Arles-Dufour, 
to save Alsace-Lorraine for France Max Muller recogmzed Arles- 
Dufour’s sincerity, but restated the case with the same arguments 
he had employed with Gladstone, and set forth more elaborately 
This led to a lengthy and sharp controversy in The Times between 
him and a writer who signed himself Scrutator Muller did not 
underrate either the knowledge or the controversial ability of 
Scrutator Indeed, he wrote at the beginning of his fifth letter, 
‘When I ventured to accept the first challenge of Scrutator, it was 
not from any presumptuous confidence that I should be able to 
withstand the arguments of one of the most powerful athletes of 
our time ’ This statement was made under the belief that Gladstone 
was the mspirer of Scrutator 

After Max Muller’s death, Mrs Max Muller in her biography 
repeated all this, and in a letter to The Times , published on February 
3, 1903, Scrutator revealed himself to be the Rev Malcolm McColl , 
and also said that long after the controversy both he and Gladstone 
had informed Muller about this To clear up the matter, he wrote 
‘Will you kindly allow me to say emphatically, and once for all, 
that Mr Gladstone was as ignorant as the rest of the world of the 
identity of Scrutator ’ Mr McColl repeated his view that Prussia 
had brought about the war deliberately from aggressive designs 
against France After praising the Berlin correspondent who at that 



250 SCHOLAR EXTRAORDINARY 

time was warning England against the similar designs of Germany 
against England, he hoped that these warnings would be heeded 

Even without knowing the real identity of Scrutator, Max Muller 
was pleased to find that the controversy had not lessened Glad- 
stone’s friendly feelings towards himself In fact, Muller was in- 
vited to Hawarden expressly to discuss the war and the prospective 
peace He arrived there on December 9, and stayed till the afternoon 
of the 1 2th There he found the American General Burnside as 
well He was one of the commanders of the Unionist armies in the 
Civil War, and it was from his ample side whiskers that the word 
side-burns has come to us He, as Muller reported to his wife, ‘told 
Gladstone some useful truths’ 

Muller was fully aware of the sympathies and attitude of Glad- 
stone Even in October he had written to Abeken that Gladstone’s 
sympathies were more Latin than Teutonic 

In his letter of the 13th he elaborated the theme further As I 
told you before, Gladstone’s sympathies are by no means for 
Germany, neither is he familiar with the German language or 
literature, or the German character or ways, also the French 
refugees have taken great hold on him He distrusts Germany, 
especially Prussia ’ Still Max Muller thought that he could be per- 
suaded, once the justice of the German claims could be brought 
home to him Then, Muller thought, Gladstone would be loyal to 
his perceptions 

But Gladstone put Muller on the most unfavourable ground The 
conversation turned mainly on the future of Alsace-Lorraine Here 
Muller himself had private mental reservations He had informed 
Stanley in his letter of August 30 that he felt it was a misfortune 
that the provinces should be demanded by Germany But he added 
sadly. ‘The so-called logic of facts makes it almost impossible not 
to demand them ’ It was on this logic of facts’ that he now took his 
stand when answering Gladstone, putting forward the plea of 
strategical necessity 

Gladstone at once replied that the greatest mistakes of the states- 
men of his time lay in giving greater consideration to physical than 
to moral powers, and that the realization of German wishes would 
become a misfortune for Germany Max Muller could only reply 
that Germany had the right to decide, and would have to bear the 
responsibility and the consequences. In his anticipation Gladstone 
was certainly right On the other hand, Muller showed himself to 



POLEMICS POLITICAL AND SCHOLARLY 251 

be prescient on the practical plane He threw in the hint that hostile 
relations between Germany and England would force the former to 
found a formidable navy As Muller admitted, the discussion 
accomplished nothing, but the participants certainly parted fnends 

Between the two peoples, on the contrary, unfriendliness grew 
German public opinion and the German press were very hostile and 
at times abusive towards England Gladstone's attitude w T as well 
known there, and the British policy in the war w r as attributed largely 
to his influence 

For his efforts to make the British people understand the German 
case, Bismarck himself thanked Muller through Abeken, who 
wrote ‘First my thanks for what you ha\e done and are doing for 
Germany, for our holy cause 5 This expression of gratitude is not 
from me alone I write in the name of Count Bismarck, who spoke 
to me only yesterday with a full and thankful recognition of your 
great and influential activity during this time, which he has heard 
through newspapers He rejoiced to have such an ally ’ Georgina 
Muller got the Cross of Merit for Ladies from the German Emperor 
for her w r ork for the wounded 

Looking back on Max Muller's involvement in the Franco- 
Prussian War, one finds it unnecessary to pronounce a judgement 
on his view that Germany was fighting an unprovoked defensive 
war Even now historians are not in agreement either about the 
immediate or the basic responsibility, and the more cautious of 
them apportion the blame evenly Bismarck himself spoilt the case 
for German innocence by taking credit in later years for having 
‘played the part of a toreador and trailed his coat to make the 
French bull charge' 

What is forgotten is that there are basic political situations which 
make wars inevitable between certain nations, and the immediate 
occasions are like the windings of a river flowing into the sea The 
plain fact was that France had held a dominant position in Europe 
since the seventeenth century, and Germany w r as now trying to 
acquire this for herself In a poultry run the pecking order is estab- 
lished easily and almost instinctively But men do not have that 
good sense, either individually or collectively. 

If this fundamental aspiration of Germany, which was consistent 
with her new power, had brought her into conflict with 
France, the same basic situation promised a prospective conflict 
with Great Britain, whose traditional policy was to keep the first

power in Europe in check It has now to be recognized that the 
Franco-Prussian War was the watershed across which the British 
people moved from their opposition to one Continental Power to 
their opposition to another The causes of the First World War, and 
a fortiori of the Second, have to be traced back to the situation 
created by the war between Germany and France in 1870 So Max 
Muller’s anxieties about the consequences of the Anglo-German 
misunderstanding that was arising out of this war were fully 
justified 

The same passionate eagerness for maintaining or resuscitating 
Anglo-German friendship, which was already gone, made Max 
Muller join in his last political controversy only a few months before 
his death, when his physical strength was reduced to its lowest It 
was over the Boer War, during which the whole Continent and 
more especially Germany displayed a fierce emotional hostility 
towards Great Britain On this occasion Germany could take up the 
moral position of Great Britain in 1870 with greater plausibility, 
and represent her as a Great Power which was brutally suppressing 
the independence of two small and weak republics 

This Muller would not admit, and he thought it was his duty to 
demonstrate the rightness of the British action in the same way as he 
had tried to show that of Germany in 1870 In the summer of 1899 
he fell very ill, and the illness continued well into the autumn 
Even so he followed the course of events with attention, and by the 
beginning of September had become convinced that a conflict was 
unavoidable On September 8, when his doctors had given up all 
hope for him, he wrote to his son that he had a voice in the matter 
too, and drew his attention to the possibility of war ‘Today is an 
ominous day, war or peace, and I am afraid it must be war, and all 
about the definition of a word, sovereignty ’ Then he added T 
want rest, but must take care not to indulge too much in it In fact 
. . I do not mean to lay down my arms as yet True, I am growmg 
thin, and very yellow Many things are wrong, yet every morning 
after a good night I feel as if nothing was the matter with me 9 

A few days after the war had begun, on October 29, he wrote 
again to his son ‘That horrible war makes me feel very unhappy — 
but now it cannot be helped, and the more it is fought out, the 
better. I still hope that before the appearance of England’s real 
power, the Boers and South Africa may collapse Is it not a mistake 
that England has now no foreign newspapers in her pay? She had 



POLEMICS POLITICAL AND SCHOLARLY 253 

formerly, but not now They do little good, but they can prevent 
mischief ’ 

He thought too that British generalship was poor, and the soldiers 
would not fight well under such leadership That was before Lord 
Roberts and Lord Kitchener had gone to South Africa It must not 
be imagined from all this that Max Muller was a warmonger Even 
when he was trying to prove that Great Britain had the right to sub- 
jugate the Boer republics, he raised the question £ Was the war 
justified ? I, in my own heart, am convinced that no war is ever 
justified, even when it seems inevitable ’ 

He had no fear that Britain would not win the war But the aggra- 
vation of the already existing Anglo- German misunderstanding was 
causing him great worry He wrote to his friend Prince Christian 
on January 2, 1900 ‘The Germans do not indeed think of sending 
any Pomeranians to help Kruger, but the entire misunderstanding 
of the position of England is very grievous It was different in the 
old times, but even England's old friends in Germany are misled 
How much I should like to step m, but my bodily strength fails me 5 

The Prince suggested that he should w r rite in some serious 
German magazine, and Max Muller sent an article to the Deutsche 
Rundschau of which he was an old contributor But the Editor could 
not publish the article. However, afterwards another German 
paper, Deutsche Revue , published the piece At once there was an 
outcry against Muller in Germany, and the really solid attack on his 
position being made by the German historian Mommsen, who was 
a friend of his Muller wrote a second article as answer to Momm- 
sen’s rejoinder, and Mommsen again replied This controversy 
ended in April 1900 In addition Max Muller contributed an article 
to the American magazine Forum explaining the causes of the anti- 
English feeling in Germany. 

In England Muller’s articles were very much appreciated, and 
Lord Salisbury wrote the following note in his own hand

Max Muller could guess that his arguments had gone home In one 
letter he was even threatened with the gallows should he venture to 
show himself in Germany But even apart from such extreme out- 
bursts, it would seem that sober opinion in Germany regretted Max 
Muller’s advocacy of the British cause After his death a German 
scholar and publicist, Karl Blind, a friend of his too, wrote in the 
May (1901) number of the Westminster Review that deep regret was 
universally felt in Germany when Muller set his face against the 
cause of the South African Republics Tt is a pity that the cloud of 
obloquy which thus suddenly overshadowed his name should have 
dimmed the lustre of his renown near the very end of his laborious 
life ’ 

This may be one of the reasons why his name was forgotten in 
Germany But if Max Muller courted all this unpopularity, it was 
m obedience to his conviction that peace in the world could be 
maintained in the future only through friendship between Great 
Britain, Germany and America However, it must be recognized 
that in regard to the true character of the Boer War Mommsen was 
more correct He observed in his reply to Muller 

The Transvaal war is one of the strangest, as well as one of the saddest, 
known to history The old, obstinate, religious-political fanaticism is 
struggling, in this forgotten and lost remnant of the Cape-Dutch, with 
modern civilization, based on a not less fanatical desire of exploiting 
the whole world Two views of the world are here in conflict — the 
battle is being waged, so to speak, between the 16th and 20th centuries 

What Mommsen regarded as unconvincing was the legalistic 
justification of the war, about which there was no disagreement be- 
tween him and Muller The final outcome has also shown that Max 
Muller’s arguments did not touch the heart of the matter The 
position of Great Britain in relation to the European colonists in 
South Africa could not be worse today if the Boer War had not been 
fought It is Krugerism which has won, and all the optimism 
created by the reconciliatory measures taken from 1908 onwards 
has been proved to be unfounded The Dutch have even won over 
the British in the Cape Province and Natal That has happened 
because the Dutch clung to a living idea with faith The British 
standpoint was merely well intentioned, and had no genuine ideo- 
logical strength behind it That is not realized even now by the 
British people in their thinking about South Africa 



POLEMICS POLITICAL AND SCHOLARLY 255 


Nevertheless, Max Muller clung to his idea till the very end of his 
life in spite of all the signs against him In his article in the Deutsche 
Revue he wrote ‘Germans, instead of looking for true blood rela- 
tions and allies for the future in England and America, have sought 
for them in France and Russia They may look for a long time I 
hope they will discover, before it is too late, that blood is thicker 
than ink, and that the Saxons of Germany, England and America 
are the true, manly and faithful allies in all struggles for freedom in 
the future as in the past 5 

In the American magazine Forum also he wrote 

The German and English characters form complements of each other 
Why not admire what is good in Germany and what is good in Eng- 
land ? If Germany, wherever she turns in her colonial expansion, 
finds ground occupied by England this is, no doubt, provoking, but it 
cannot be helped now Property is property A war of words be- 
tween the two countries seems harmless enough, but a real war would 
be so terrible that humanity shudders at the very mention of it 

Fortunately, he did not live to see that war 

Though Max Muller found any opening for joining in a political 
discussion irresistible, he seems always to have had a feeling that 
such controversies were almost futile During the Franco-Prussian 
War he had written to Gladstone ‘We must take men as they are, 
and we must take nations as they are , a nation flushed with victory 
and crushed by grief is not like a nation in its right mind It is with 
nations as with individuals ? 

All that can be said in explanation of the intellectual who involves 
himself with political matters is that in the first place he is driven 
by the innate impulse of man the political animal; and in so far as 
he is a sentient being, it becomes a case of conscience with him 
Not even this tenuous plea can be put forward to justify scholarly 
controversies They are always barren and futile, often ill-tempered 
and unmannerly, at times scurrilous Only those who do not follow 
such controversies and their results can imagine that knowledge 
is advanced by them Max Muller wrote in 1875, when he opened 
the only scholarly duel of his life T am not one of those who 
believe that truth is much advanced by public controversy, and I 
have carefully eschewed it during the whole of my literary career/ 
There can be no doubt that he was right in this view Scholars 
are scarcely ever convinced by the opinions of other scholars workmg

m their field Max Muller himself wrote that he had considered 
the objections of his critics but had been confirmed by them in his 
conclusions At all events he said to some of his distinguished 
opponents, as he did to Mommsen ‘Let us agree to differ 5 So he 
wrote to Romanes in 1891 T believe we both care far more for 
what is right, than for who is right Facts and correct deductions 
from facts, are all we ought to care for, who discovered them and 
who made them is of very little consequence Yet I know from 
experience that there are but few who would be so completely above 
all personal feelings as you have shown yourself to be ’ 

He knew it only too well, and was taking the most charitable view 
of scholarly disagreements These are due in the first instance to 
dogmatism, which will ignore facts deliberately when the}' are not 
consistent with the dogmatic view, and beyond dogmatism stands 
self-conceit and jealousy, which make the disputants descend to 
personalities When a scholar gets hardened in his animosities he 
behaves like a gladiator or a prize-fighter, or rather worse because 
he is not exposed to any physical punishment But Max Muller, 
even when he had to be severe on the arguments of his opponents, 
never indulged in discourtesy, far less abuse He even scrupulously 
avoided expressing an opimon when it might be attributed to per- 
sonal motives 

It was not however Max Muller’s fate to be spared scholarly 
attacks, and some of the worst kind, in spite of his disapproval of 
them These continued over more than thirty years during his life, 
and were carried on even after his death They came from a single 
source, partly inspired from another The direct source was the 
American Sanskntist, William Dwight Whitney of Yale, and be- 
hind him stood a clique of German Sanskntists Scholars who do 
not agree in their positive views generally agree in their animosities. 
The feud of Whitney against Max Muller was almost like an in- 
herited Corsican vendetta 

But the immediate occasion of this disagreeable controversy was 
furnished by a very pleasant expression of difference between two 
learned men They were Darwin and Max Muller An account has 
been given in a previous chapter of Max Muller’s view that Dar- 
win’s theory of evolution could not be extended to explain the 
origin of language Th z pooh-pooh theory , as it was popularly called, 
which Darwin had originated under the influence of his friend 
H Wedgwood, the author of the Etymological Dictionary of the 



POLEMICS POLITICAL AND SCHOLARLY 257 


English Language , could not, according to Muller, account for 
human speech 

Early in 1873 Max Muller decided publicly to express his dissent 
to Darwin’s theory, and in March he gave a series of lectures at the 
Royal Institution entitled Mr Darwin's Philosophy of Language 
These were printed in the May, June and July issues of Fraser's 
Magazine Max Muller sent the pamphlet to Darwin on June 29 
and expressed the hope that he would accept the remarks in it ‘as 
what they were intended to be — an open statement of the diffi- 
culties which a student of language feels when called upon to explain 
the languages of man, such as he finds them, as the possible develop- 
ment of what has been called the language of animals’ He also 
assured Darwin that he was one of his diligent readers and sincere 
admirers 

On July 3 Darwm replied with equal courtesy and frankness 

As far as language is concerned, I am not worthy to be your adversary, 
as I know extremely little about it, and that little learnt from very few 
books I should have been glad to have avoided the whole subject, but 
was compelled to take it up as well as I could He who is fully con- 
vinced, as I am, that man is descended from some lower animal, is 
almost forced to believe a prion that articulate language has been 
developed from inarticulate cries, and he is therefore hardly a fair 
judge of the arguments opposed to this belief 

Later Muller and Darwin met He was taken to Down, Darwin’s 
house in Kent, by Sir John Lubbock, later Lord Avebury, and in 
his autobiographical reminiscences Muller said that there were few 
episodes in his life which he valued more I shall quote the whole 
account from Auld Lang Syne , vol I, which in the copy of the book 
I am using bears corrections in his own hand He wrote 

I need not describe the simplicity of his house and the grandeur of the 
man who had lived and worked in it for so many years Darwin gave 
me a hearty welcome, showed me his garden and his flowers, and then 
took me into his study, and standing leaning against his desk began to 
examine me He said at once that personally he was quite ignorant of 
the science of language, and had taken his facts and opinions chiefly 
from his friend, Mr Wedgwood I had been warned that Darwm could 
not carry on a serious discussion for more than about ten minutes or a 
quarter of an hour, as it always brought on his life-long complaint of 
sickness I therefore put before him in the shortest way possible the

difficulties which prevented me from accepting the theory of animals 
forming a language out of interjections and sounds of nature I laid 
stress on the fact that no animal, except the human animal, had ever 
made a step towards generalization of percepts, and I gave him a few 
illustrations of how our words for one to ten, for father, mother, sun 
and moon had really and historically been evolved That man thus 
formed a real anomaly in the growth of the animal kingdom, as con- 
ceived by him, I fully admitted , but it was impossible for me to ignore 
facts, and language in its true meaning has always been to my mind a 
fact that could not be wiped away by argument, as little as the Hima- 
layas could be wiped away with a silk handkerchief even in millions of 
years He listened most attentively, he asked questions, but raised no 
serious objections Before he shook hands and left me, he said in the 
kindest way, ‘You are a dangerous man ’ I ventured to reply, ‘There 
can be no danger in our search for truth,’ and he left the room 

Max Muller also sent to Darwin his subsequent controversial 
pieces, and though in them there were strong criticisms of Darwin’s 
theory the latter never took offence To the last pamphlet that 
Muller sent him, Darwin sent the following characteristic reply 


‘Down, Beckenham, Kent 

15th October, 1875 

My dear Sir, 

I am greatly obliged to you for so kindly sending me your essay In 
Self-defence, which I am sure will interest me much With respect to 
our differences, though some of your remarks have been rather sting- 
ing, they have all been made so gracefully, I declare that I am like the 
man in the story who boasted that he had been soundly horsewhipped 
by a Duke 


Pray believe me, 

Yours very sincerely, 
CHARLES DARWIN 


Anything more to the credit of two great mmds in their disagree- 
ment over a scientific question cannot be imagined Yet this balance 
of mind was completely absent in its offshoot, in the course of 
which Darwin’s son George forced Muller into his only open con- 
troversy with another scholar, Whitney 

George Darwin was not very straightforward in defending his 
father in the Contemporary Review , for instead of calling his article 
a reply to Muller and relying on his own arguments he gave it the 



POLEMICS POLITICAL AND SCHOLARLY 259 

deceptive title of ‘Professor Whitney on the Origin of Language ', 
and leaned heavily on the American scholar The article was sub- 
stantially a dishing out in England of Whitney's attacks on Max 
Muller in America So Muller did not read the piece until a friend 
told him about it 

Max Muller in his reply to George Darwin in the Contemporary 
Review (November 1874) was very severe on Whitney, and Whitney 
then published another intemperate attack This provoked Muller 
so much that he gave up his wise resolution to take no notice of 
Whitney's attacks (which had been going on for more than a decade), 
nor to take up any of his frequent challenges, and came out with a 
long pamphlet of seventy-seven pages, to which he gave the title 
In Self-defence 

However, Muller put forward a practical suggestion, which was 
to place the differences before a panel of three scholars who were 
to be chosen by Whitney from his best friends who were also Pro - 
fessores ordmaru in any English, German, French or Italian univer- 
sity He also promised to abide by their judgement unreservedly 
He then set forth twenty points as to simple matters of fact which 
he regarded as the principal bones of contention between himself 
and Whitney They were indeed bones, and very bare ones too, as 
will be seen from the selection of five that I give The numbers are 
Muller's 

1 Whether the Latin of the inscription on the Duihan Column 
represents the Latin as spoken in 263 b c 

2 Whether Ahura-Mazda can be rendered by ‘the mighty spirit* 

3 Whether sarvanama in Sanskrit means ‘name of everything* 

14 Whether in saying that the soft consonants can be intonated, I 
could have meant that they may or may not be intonated 
1 8 Whether E Burnouf has written two or three bulky volumes on the 
Avesta 9 or only one 

Publicly Whitney took no notice of the proposal for arbitration 
It is impossible to explain the ferocity of Whitney on any scholarly 
grounds The American journalist Moncure Conway, who was a 
friend of both, felt very distressed by this misunderstanding He 
tried to mediate and bring about a leconcihation He said that when 
leaving England to visit the United States for a few months he met 
Max Muller and discussed his intention with him Muller author- 
ized him to put the proposal for arbitration personally to Whitney, 



260 SCHOLAR EXTRAORDINARY 

which Conway did But Whitney was not willing, and Conway was 
not able to discover exactly why Nothing further came out of his 
efforts 

Whitney took his revenge on Max Muller in a review of Muller’s 
edition of the Rig-Veda , which had been completed in 1874 This 
review, published in The New Englander for October, 1876, pro- 
claimed Aufrecht’s edition as the real publication of the Veda and 
added that 'nothing can take away from this scholar the chief honour 
of being the editor of the Veda ’ As to Max Muller, he observed, 
apart from what he had done in publishing the commentary of 
Sayana, 'he has yet to link his name with the Rig-Veda itself by any 
special tie which will bear testing’ Then he concluded 

He has had his reward No man was ever before so lavishly paid, in 
money and in fame, for even the most unexceptionable performance of 
such a task For personal gratitude in addition, there is not the 
slightest call If Muller had never put hand to the Veda y his fellow- 
students would have had the material they needed perhaps ten years 
earlier, and Vedic study would be at the present moment proportion- 
ately advanced 

Not satisfied with this, Whitney added a footnote which ran 
'The original honorarium, of about £500 a volume, is well-nigh or 
quite unprecedented in the history of purely scholarly enterprises , 
and the grounds on which the final additional gift of £2,000 was be- 
stowed have never been made public ’ 

One wonders whether Whitney was conscious that in all this he 
was providing a self-revelation not less frank than Rousseau’s 
deliberate Confessions 

He continued his attacks, and in 1892 published a violent one on 
a new edition of Max Muller’s Science of Language Upon this Max 
Muller wrote to a friend who had criticized Whitney 

I feel very grateful for what you said about Whitney I do not know 
whether you have followed his raids from the first I thought at first 
he was honest and sincere, and took the trouble to answer him in a 
long paper, In Self-Defence He went on sending me articles, anony- 
mous or signed, in fact, he placed himself outside the pale of literary 
criticism As without losing all self-respect, I could not answer him, 
I have made it a rule for at least fifteen years never to read his in- 
vectives 



POLEMICS POLITICAL AND SCHOLARLY 261 


Whitney died in 1894, and Max Muller had a respite for a few years 
before his own death 

But Whitney bequeathed his vendetta When Max Muller died, 
m its obituary notice the New York Nation revived Whitney’s re- 
jection of the claim of Max Muller to be the editor of the Rig-V eda , 
and wrote ‘What Max Muller constantly proclaimed to be his own 
great work, the edition of the Rig-Veda, was in reality not his at all 
. A German scholar did the work, and Muller appropriated the 
credit for it ’ 

In great distress Mrs Muller wrote to the well-known Sanskrit 
scholars who had known her husband or collaborated with him, and 
after obtaining their opinion set down their version of the matter 
‘Had there been any truth in the accusation its discovery would not 
have been left to an anonymous accuser in America, nor its exposure 
reserved until after Max Muller’s death ’ 

This so infuriated the writer in the Nation that when reviewing 
Mrs Muller’s biography of her husband he repeated the statements 
m a more offensive and cruel manner He said that there was no due 
acknowledgement from Max Muller of the help received from his 
assistants, and gave his version of the facts in the following words 

Muller was hired to bring out the Rig-Veda A part of the work had 
already been done by Rosen This part of the text, together with the 
commentary, Muller brought out without Aufrecht’s assistance But 
Muller had already grown weary of the scholarly toil He spoke of it as 
slavery, and said that, in his opinion, life was meant for more than the 
drudgery of collating manuscripts So, for part of the next volume and 
for all of the third volume, he hired Aufrecht to do his work for him, 
though it was just the work he himself had been hired to do 

There was more in this vein 

How Max Muller worked on the Rig-Veda and what help he re- 
ceived, as well as his acknowledgements to Aufrecht and his other 
helpers, has been described in a previous chapter 

Perhaps from the point of view of a specialist in Sanskrit scholar- 
ship the opinion which Cowell expressed to Mrs Muller was the 
most balanced Cowell knew Max Muller well, and was then 
Professor of Sanskrit at Cambridge He wrote * 

My dear Mrs Max Muller, 

I sympathize with you most sincerely in what you say — my doubt 
is whether it would be well to rouse up again old feelings of animosity

which the lapse of years has very much thrown into oblivion Professor 
Whitney was the mam leader in those attacks, and since he passed 
away we have heard hardly any allusion to them I hardly think it is 
right to consider the edition of Rig-Veda your husband’s pre-eminent 
work, surely such books as his History of Ancient Sanskrit Literature 
and other similar, works show more clearly his real genius and original 
powers The text of the 1 Rig- Veda has been kept so religiously in the 
MSS that it was a very easy task to edit it The Commentary which fills 
so much of Max Muller’s edition and which I and many Sanskntists 
prize so highly, was an especial object of attack to Whitney and most 
of the representatives of his school Max Muller proved that he 
thoroughly understood that difficult commentary by the masterly way 
m which he edited alone the whole of Vol I and the great part of Vol II 
After that he left part of the labour of collation etc to his younger 
co-adjutors, while he himself thus gained some leisure for researches 
into other fields of Sanskrit literature He was doing far better service 
to the Sanskrit cause by interesting such a wide circle of readers by his 
enthusiastic lectures and disquisitions, expressed in his singularly 
beautiful English style, than he would have done if he had spent the 
years in toiling alone to complete the text of Sayana’s Commentary 
You will thus see that I look on the great edition of the Rig-Veda as 
only one part of the wide field of Max Muller’s energy, and by no 
means the part which showed his powers at their highest point 

I hope this letter will not grieve you I hope you will think it quietly 
over 

Nothing could be more sensible, if Max Muller’s work on the 
Rig-Veda were only for fellow-scholars But it was not He edited 
it to make it widely known both in the West and the East, and with 
the more practical motive of influencing the religious life of con- 
temporary Hindus So far as popularization was concerned he fully 
succeeded, and he also did for Hindus what no other scholar had 
ever accomplished From the very first the value of his edition was 
recognized in India Among the notable Hindus to do so was Raja 
Radhakanta Deb, a Bengali nobleman, patron of Sanskrit scholar- 
ship and himself the editor of a new Sanskrit encyclopaedia and 
dictionary, and a leader of orthodox Hindus in Bengal On receiving 
the first volume, he wrote a long letter of appreciation to Max 
Muller in which among many other things he said ‘Your labours 
will furnish the Vaidik Pandits with a complete collection of the 
holy Samhita of the first Veda only detached portions of which are 
to be found in the possession of a few of them ’ 



POLEMICS POLITICAL AND SCHOLARLY 263 

He wrote again when the second volume was also sent to him 
'By successfully embarking on such an arduous undertaking, you 
have done to the Hindus an inestimable benefit, supplying them 
with a correct and superb edition of their Holy scriptures Accept 
therefore my most grateful and sincere thanks, which, in common 
with my countrymen, I owe to you 3 

After the publication of the first three volumes Dr Martin Haug, 
who was at Poona, informed Muller how a great assembly of Brah- 
min pundits there had made use of them to correct their own MSS 
They would not themselves touch the volumes, because the idea 
had got abroad in India that the ink used in printing them had cow’s 
blood in it and so had become impure They had Muller’s text read 
to them, and pronounced the judgement ‘This edition must be 
written by a great Pundit versed in the Vedas and Sastras 3 

Finally, when the whole work was published, one of the associa- 
tions of the new monotheistic Hindus formally thanked Muller and 
wrote ‘By publishing the Rig-Veda at a time when Yedic learning 
has, by some sad fatality, become almost extinct in the land of its 
birth, you have conferred a boon upon us Hindus, for which we 
cannot but be eternally grateful 3 Last of all I shall translate from 
Bengali the public tribute which Swami Vivekananda, leader of the 
new Hindu revivalist movement in Bengal, paid to Max Muller in 
one of his books He wrote ‘Professor Max Muller is the leading 
figure among Western Sanskrit scholars The Rig- Veda , upon which 
nobody could set his eyes as a whole, has now been beautifully 
printed, and can be read by the general public, as a result of an en- 
ormous expenditure on the part of the East India Company and 
years of labour on the part of the Professor. 3 

The fact remains that Max Muller’s text was the only one for 
decades in which modern Indians could read or see their oldest 
scripture That was why, after the exhaustion of the first volume 
and expected exhaustion of the others of the first edition, when the 
Secretary of State for India would not sanction the money for re- 
printing the whole work, an Indian Prince came forward to contri- 
bute more than £4,000 for a complete and revised second edition 
In his preface to the first volume of this second edition, Max 
Muller wrote. 

The Members of the India Council, however, took a different view 
from that taken by their predecessors, the Directors of the old East 



264 SCHOLAR EXTRAORDINARY 

India Company While the Directors on the advice of the greatest 
Sanskrit scholar of the time, Professor H H Wilson, their illustrious 
Librarian, declared that ‘the publication of so important and interest- 
ing a work as the editio pnnceps of the Rig- Veda was in a peculiar 
manner deserving of the patronage of the East India Company, con- 
nected as it is with the early religion, history, and language of the great 
body of their Indian subjects’, the Literary Committee of the India 
Council, acting on somewhat different advice, declined my offer of 
publishing a new edition of the Rig- Veda , though a strong desire for it 
had been expressed by scholars both in India and Europe, and though 
my gratuitous services were placed at their disposal 

Even this involved Muller in an unpleasant controversy with a 
fellow- Sanskritist, Professor Boehtlmgk of St Petersburg, who had 
never forgiven him for refusing to go to that city to work under him 
In 1891, in a pamphlet attacking him as a mythologist, he said that 
what Muller had written about the refusal of the India Office to bear 
the cost of the second edition was pure invention 

A general moral seems to be justified by all scholarly controver- 
sies scholars themselves should avoid them, and the layman should 
ignore them 


### LIFE, LOVE AND DEATH
Chapter 2 

LIFE, LOVE AND DEATH 

From all the accounts that Max Muller gave of his intellectual 
aims, methods and work it could be seen that he was less a scholar 
m the strict sense of the word than an intellectual, and the difference 
is basic It is that which distinguishes a painter or sculptor from a 
craftsman What then is an intellectual ? An intellectual is a man or 
woman who applies his intellectual faculties to understanding and 
interpreting the world around him in any or all its aspects As a 
result of study, observation or experiment, he formulates con- 
clusions which he believes to be true and communicates his ideas to 
his fellow-men with a view to influencing their minds, lives and 
actions 

But within this definition, broadly speaking, intellectuals fall into 
two classes The first type is des cerebrauxpur sang , and the second, 
those whose intellectual activity is driven by an emotional motive 
power, principally love, but at times even by its opposite, hatred 
‘Great thoughts come from the heart,’ said Vauvenargues, and 
even impersonal scientific thought dealing with the world of matter 
does not furnish any exception Pasteur’s scientific researches were 
inspired by compassion 

Max Muller belonged to this type, just as his respected and elder 
contemporary, Darwin, belonged to the other type Muller was 
naturally endowed with an immense zest for life, and also with an 
overmastering impulse to love He believed the two to be connected 
m some way, and at the very end of his life wrote to his son* 

You certainly have grown older and more serious — no wonder, con- 
sidering what you have had to go through You’ll understand now my 
old motto, Das Leben tst ernst [Life is earnest], though that does not 
prevent us from enjoying what can be enjoyed I hope you would grow 
very fond of somebody or something — that is after all the secret of 
enjoying life, call it a hobby or some passion, even a passion for statis- 
tics or something of the kind, but a passion, Otherwise, life becomes 
humdrum Dressing and washing in the morning and undressing at 
night — one gets so tired of it

What suffering Max Muller inflicted on himself by falling in 
love at first sight has already been described But when at last he 
got married he could have been expected to live happily ever after- 
wards He could not and did not, however, for love brings the idea of 
death ever near to life, and even when it is not expected it seems to 
lie in ambush everywhere 

‘All men are under a sentence of death, with indefinite reprieves 5 , 
said Victor Hugo As a rule, however, men are able to forget that 
this sentence is the most certain thing in life The spectacle of death 
always carries this anaesthetic with it There is nothing wrong in 
this reaction so long as men live and die like animals, which basic- 
ally they are But it becomes contemptible when it is aired as a 
superior moral attitude 

As soon as man became conscious of his existence and capable of 
evaluating it, he also felt that living was meamngless unless he could 
reconcile it with death One of the oldest and most sublime of the 
Hindu religious utterances is that which says ‘What should I do 
with anything which does not make me indestructible ^ The answer 
given so far has been an amazing illusion, belief in the continuation 
of individual life after death 

This consolation has been enough in most circumstances, for 
basically men live on by virtue of a biological impulse But when one 
human being has loved another so much that he or she has ceased 
to be self-reliant in living, the death of the loved one mortally 
wounds that biological urge to live And that wound is most grievous 
when a child dies, for here two biological forces clash, the one which 
makes us clmg to our own life and the other which makes us love 
our children When this happens even the strong and the brave can 
only limp through life They are never able to recover their faith in 
earthly life Even when they have an unwavering faith in an after- 
life, they cannot explain why they should have received this blow 

This terrible calamity of living on, crippled by death, befell Max 
Muller when he lost his eldest daughter in 1876 when she was only 
sixteen years old In her biography Mrs Max Muller wrote ‘He 
never entirely recovered from this loss the spring, the joy of life 
was gone He suffered severely, and it was months before he could 
at all rouse himself and take up work again 5 But she did not de- 
scribe what his suffering really was He set that down in a diary, 
kept over seven years on 486 folios To read this volume among the 
papers left by Max Muller is a harrowing experience 



LIFE, LOVE AND DEATH 267 

However, he was familiar with the idea of death from his child- 
hood on account of the early death of his father After that he also 
saw many relatives die, and on many occasions recorded his thoughts 
and feelings about death More intimately the idea of death came 
home to him when a year after his marriage his wife lay very near to 
death for some days after the birth of her first child On December 20 
the child was born, and for two days the doctors were without any 
hope of saving the mother Even before this she was very unwell, 
causing Muller very great anxiety So on December 10 he wrote to 
Miss Grenfell Tf anything should happen to her now, our Christ- 
mas will be a very sad time ? I try to keep up my spirits, but it is 
hard work yet I feel that suffering with her is worth more than all 
the happiness of the world with others I pray to God that it may all 
pass over, but if it must be, we both feel that it is meant as a whole- 
some trial, and that we must thank God for what He gives and what 
He takes from us * 

He described his state of mind when his wife was sufficiently 
recovered, and wrote on February 6, 1861 . 

Darling baby I hardly dare to call her ours as yet, and yet what can 
we call ours if God did not vouchsafe it to us from day to day ? And yet 
it is so difficult to give oneself up entirely to Him, to trust everything 
to His Love and Wisdom I thought I could say ‘Thy will be done*, 
but when you were so ill I found I could not — my own will struggled 
against His will — I prayed as we ought not to pray — and yet He heard 
me My darling, it is so difficult not to grow very fond of this life and 
all its happiness — but the more we love it, the more we suffer, for we 
know we must leave it and it must all pass away Does love pass away, 
too ? I cannot believe it 

Some months later he also wrote to Palgrave about his rebellious 
mood Palgrave’s father had died, and he wrote. 

I know from experience that in the presence of great grief I have nothing 
to say, and for a loss like yours there is no comfort till we can say by 

ourselves, ‘Thy will be done I * * * 5 . I remember but one time in my whole 

life when I could not say that . when my wife, whom I had loved for 

six years without the faintest hope of ever calling her my wife, when 
she, after one year of a blessed life, was for two days given up as hope- 
less by the doctors, then I broke down, and I could not say, ‘Thy will 

be done*.

Whenever Max Muller heard of the death of someone who was a 
friend or relative, and more especially when parents lost a child, he 
tried, in offering his consolation, to understand or rather come to 
terms with death But he could only fall back on faith So, when he 
heard of the death of his sister Auguste’s little son, who was his 
godson, he wrote to his mother 

Sorrow is necessary and good for men , one learns to understand that 
each joy must be indemnified by suffering, that each new tie which 
knits our hearts to this life must be loosed again, and the tighter and 
the closer it was knit, the keener the pain of loosening it Should we 
then attach our hearts to nothing, and pass quietly and unsympa- 
thetically through this world, as if we had nothing to do with it ? We 
neither could nor ought to act so Nature itself knits the first tie be- 
tween parents and children, and new ties through our whole life We 
are not here for reward, for the enjoyment of undisturbed peace, or 
from mere accident, but for trial, for improvement, perhaps for 
punishment, for the only union which can ensure the happiness of 
men, the union between our self and God’s self, is broken, or at least 
obscured, by our birth, and the highest object of our life is to find this 
bond again, to remain ever conscious of it, and hold fast to it in life 
and death 

Muller wrote this when he was only twenty-five 

At the age of forty-three when he was the father of four children, 
three daughters and one son, he wrote in a reconciled vein on the 
occasion of another bereavement of his sister, the death this time of 
a daughter He observed to his wife ‘Krug [his brother-in-law] 
speaks so freely about those who are no more , I can only listen, for 
what can one say ? Our view of death is wrong, no doubt, because 
our view of life is wrong ’ 

He thought his happiness in his family was so great that he could 
neither wish nor ask for more Then he remarked T should like to 
sit quiet, to rest and be thankful, not to move, lest something should 
move and fall ’ 

Early in 1868 he lost his only sister Auguste, and after getting a 
letter from his mother wrote to his wife ‘Now that she is gone, all 
those pleasant recollections which constantly pass through one’s 
mind are altogether changed, all life and reality taken out of them; 
one’s own life brought more clearly before one’s mind, as what it 
really is, a short stay in a foreign land ’ 

Again he reverts to their own life with the same premonition. 



269 


LIFE, LOVE AND DEATH 

‘There is still so much left us, so much to be happy and thankful 
for, and yet here, too, the thought always rushes across one’s 
brightest hours, it cannot last ’ A fear of happiness seems to have 
been growing on him, for a month later he again wrote to his wife 
‘It is true that I have plenty of happiness, but great happiness makes 
one think so often that it cannot last, and that one will some day 
have to give up all to which one’s heart clings . But at the same 
time we can thankfully enjoy all that God gives, and few have more 
reason to say this than I ’ 

Six years later, after visiting the grave of his sister-in-law 
Charlotte, he wrote to his wife ‘By a grave one learns what life 
really is, that it is not here but elsewhere , that this is the exile, and 
there is our home / As we grow older the tram of life goes faster and 
faster, those with whom we travelled together step out from station 
to station, and our own station, too, will soon be reached^ 

These are only a few of the reflections on death which Max 
Muller set down even before he suffered any bereavement in his 
own immediate family He could never forget death None the less, 
his natural vitality enabled him to carry on a post-marital love 
affair with almost childlike gusto, in which he could be as playful 
as he was passionate For instance, three years after his marriage, 
when he was conducting an examination for the Civil Service Com- 
missioners in London, he wrote to his wife 

I have not much time, my dear wifey, and I am sitting surrounded by 
sixty candidates, all writing Sanskrit as hard as ever they can — but I 
can send you a few lines just to shake hands with you or to send you a 
loving kiss It is quite miserable to be away from you, and I feel hardly 
myself when I am away from you We have grown into one as much as 
two souls ever can, and I feel when I am with you that there is nothing 
more to wish for, that life is perfect May God let us enjoy His happi- 
ness for many years 

He also showed his capacity for love by being willing to spend 
money on her without being compelled to do so by being black- 
mailed by the turning of her back on him in bed, in the manner of 
the normal Hindu wife who believes that in married life money or 
gold, silk, and fine cotton, are the outward signs of an inward grace 
A Maltese lace shawl for the ‘dear wifey’ at ten pounds, a satm gown, 
pins and jewellery are mentioned in Muller’s letters There are also 
two unusual communications after more than mne years of marriage.

‘I have ordered for you/ he writes on January 31, 1869, ‘24 pint 
bottles of champagne from London I thought small bottles would 
be better for your small meals — they will arrive tomorrow afternoon 
or Tuesday rnormng Is there anything else I can send you, for 
with all your hard work, I feel sure that you want support 

He wrote again three days later T am so glad to hear that you are 
better Would it not be better to ask Seymour to let you have a 
dozen of his port and pay him for it ? I have no port here, and if I 
write to London it will take several days before it settled again and is 
fit to dunk If you cannot get any port, the best thing would be to 
write to the Civil Service ’ 

Two days later he tells about a different kind of order T also 
want to ordei a carpet for your bedroom The green carpet turned 
out very bad, it is tapestry, not Brussels — so I had one of those put 
down in the nursery, and the other put away I have had all the 
boards taken up and relaid The curtains will look very well, but 
the old chintz would not do ’ 

Mrs Max Muller liked the social life of the class from which she 
came, and at times she appears to have been away from home 
These absences, as well as Max Muller’s when he travelled abroad, 
gave him the opportunity to write letters to his wife, which are pre- 
served in five volumes They give a picture of the sunshine and 
showers in their married life, the sadness being as tender as the 
gaiety, with the religious note always coming up to the dominant 
level, as when he wrote T am yours as you are mine It is not that 
you own me or I own you — we were given to each other by Him 
who made all things — you are mine by Divine right as I am yours 
Though many people talk of Divine right and know not what they 
mean, My own beloved Soul, I know it, and sometimes feel as if I 
live with you in heaven and in full eternity ’ 

Muller on his part hated social life as conventionally understood, 
especially in London So he wrote to his wife on July 16, 1864. T 
should not like to live in London, no, not for much money, — this 
noise, this skirmish, this dming out and gossiping, this trying to out- 
do each other in pretence and conceit, is quite sickening ’ 

Again, learning of the death of Dickens, he wrote* ‘Poor Charles 
Dickens 1 It is a great loss — but I believe his life was not happy in 
spite of all his brilliant success They call him vulgar, but in his 
abstaining from mixing in what people call good society, I think he 
showed the true nobility of his soul I confess I never see so much 



LIFE, LOVE AND DEATH 271 

vulgarity of soul as among that good society with, its insolence of 
wealth and pnde of millinery ’ 

And in 1890 he wrote 'It is the most horrible invention, what is 
called Society, and is really no society at all, but simply make- 
believe, stupidity, and vanity Life is one thing, society another — but 
society eats up life 5 

He particularly disliked the large dinner parties in London, and 
preferred a small party of four to six guests To the end of his life 
he received many distinguished guests in his own house at Oxford, 
and from all parts of the world Even when he was only a young 
married man the great Tennyson came and stayed one night in his 
house in High Street His wife, a young housekeeper, did her best 
for the honoured guest, but at dinner Tennyson was rather put out to 
find that the sauce with the salmon was not the one he preferred 
He was pleased however with the wing of a chicken, and said that 
the only advantage he got from being Poet Laureate was that he 
generally received the liver-wmg of a chicken The next morning 
at breakfast the young people rather plumed themselves on having 
been able to get a dish of cutlets, but Tennyson whipped off the 
cover of the hot dish and seeing them cried out ‘Mutton chops f the 
staple of every bad inn in England 1 ’ But otherwise he was delight- 
ful, and asked many questions about Indian poetry Max Muller 
knew Ruskm very well, and could not help comparing the two He 
wrote ‘It is difficult to define the difference between an Oxford 
man and a Cambridge man, but if Ruskm was decidedly a repre- 
sentative of Oxford, Tennyson was a true son of the sister univer- 
sity ’ That was not on the score of manners, for Ruskm could be 
very ill-mannered in writing as well as in speaking 

When children came Max Muller’s happiness brimmed over 
There were three daughters, the first Ada, born in December i860; 
the second Mary, bom February 1862; and the third Beatrice, 
bom August 1864 Then arrived the only son, on June 9, 1867 
Max Muller had professed to be quite satisfied with his three little 
girls, but he also rejoiced in the birth of what in Germany was called 
a Stammhalter Giving the news to his cousin, Captain Adolph von 
Basedow, he wrote ‘I wish to ask you to be one of his godfathers. 
Both G and I wish the boy not to be exclusively English, and, like 
his name, Wilhelm Grenfell, so his godfathers should be of both 
countries He can then later on choose his own home, and like the 
old proverb, ubi bene , ibi patna ’

Of course, to all responsible and affectionate parents children are 
a constant trial, but the really important thing in the parent-child 
relationship is the question whether under these eddies of anxiety 
and even irritation there runs a deep current of happiness In Max 
Muller's case there could be no doubt about that After his death a 
companion of his daughters, who was then Mrs Boas, wrote a 
description of Muller as a father 'The memory I have of him will 
always be chiefly that of the loving father of our dear child-friends, 
Ada, Mary, and Beatrice No doubt you will have quite forgotten 
the way in which he would join, with bright unfeigned sympathy, 
m our plays and projects on the happy Saturday half-holiday after- 
noons we spent together, but we — the children — will never for- 
get it ’ 

But even then Max Muller’s distrust of life in this world, his sense 
of the evanescence of human happiness, would not leave him, as will 
be seen from the following letter to his wife written on March 13, 
1869 

I long to have my two chicks here again — it seems so incomplete 
without them How hard it must be to give up one of one’s own children 
— and yet there was a time when we had not got them and we seemed 
quite satisfied with life then So it goes on — more and more ties with 
every year — happiness that binds us to this life, while we ought really 
to try to get freer and freer from what binds us here, and more ready to 
leave it all when the time comes to part 

The blow fell, and he was not ready In the summer of 1876 the 
whole family went to Germany, and settled for the time being at 
Dresden There the son Wilhelm went to a German Gymnasium, 
and the girls studied under masters and made good progress in their 
studies There he heard of the death of Edith, Dean Liddell’s 
daughter, and wrote to Stanley 'Poor Liddell, I think of him every 
day, and I fear that he will never recover from that blow. That 
daughter of his was a most charming, lovable creature, so natural, so 
beautiful, and he so fond, so proud of her 1 "Let us die, in order,” 
says a poet in the Veda, "that the old may not weep for the young ” 
It was then, as it is now, inscrutable, and I doubt whether we have 
learnt to be more patient, and to wait for our time more cheerfully, 
than the old worshipper of the Vedic gods ’ 

'Darkness and light divide the course of time’, said an old English 
mystic In the Veda , too, the night and day are called sisters. That

the young do not weep for the old belongs to the day, and that is 
natural , but when the old weep for the young that belongs to the 
everlasting night out of which they never come In just over six 
months from the day he wrote about the death of Liddell’s daughter, 
Max Muller was to pass into that night 

His eldest daughter Ada began to feel ill from the end of Novem- 
ber, and was seriously ill in the second week of December It was 
meningitis She died at 6 a in on the morning of the 16th Mrs 
Max Muller had left a day-to-day account of her illness, death and 
burial in fifteen pages, and this is her account of the last moments 

I remember when watching her that hour, I prayed that God’s Will 
might be ours We sent for Dr Oehme, but I saw what was at hand, 
the breath grew quieter and slower I threw myself on my knees by her 
and said aloud — ‘Lord into Thy hands we commend her spirit ’ Then 
came three deep sighs, and the shoulders moved a little, and all was 
still Max poured down some strong wine and we heard it swallowed 
I never heard any breath after that, and I turned to Max and cried, 
‘It is over 5 I thought I felt a little fluttering of the heart, and we con- 
tinued to fan her — but I believe now it was my own pulse, and when 
Dr Oehme came he said it was all over It was 6am that her sweet 
spirit must have passed away No struggle or spasm There could not 
have been anything more gentle and blessed Max told the other poor 
children and his old mother, and it was heart-breaking to hear their 
cries as I stood over the still form that should never hear cry or know 
sorrow again 

She was buried on the 19th, a day before her sixteenth birthday, 
in the graveyard of the beautiful church at Dresden Max Muller 
remained there till April 1877 with his mother Then the family 
returned to England 

The loss of his daughter completely broke Max Muller, and 
made him incapable of relying on his own mental resources in 
order to live So within a few days of his bereavement he wrote to 
his friends and relatives in identical language . ‘My whole life now 
belongs to her and her memory, till our long journey is over * It was 
not said under the immediate shock of grief This became his 
settled mood A year later he wrote to his wife * ‘ One can never believe 
m life again. One does what is one’s duty, but the joy of life of which 
we had so much, is all gone It is not that one does not feel grateful 
for what life is, — but one always asks — For how long ? This has

ceased to be our home, though it was such a happy home — one 
feels now, it is a mere waiting room where one is hustled about 9 
This leitmotive recurs in successive letters Some may be quoted 
January 8, 1878 T hope I shall have a little rest now — I cannot do 
without it — it is only when I am alone, and can be together with our 
darling child that I feel able to endure this life, and can go on with 
my work 9 August 23, 1878 Tt is strange being here alone — I feel 
as if I had no business to be here at all — I only live for you and with 
you My own life seems finished here on earth I have had that feel- 
ing ever since our darling left us — I ought to have gone first, not she. 9 
He wrote this from Whitby, where he had gone to have a change 
January 13, 1879 T find it so hard to be idle, still harder to smile 
and look happy, and talk about everything except what is in one’s 
heart When I saw all the children together, I looked for one face 
only which was not there You know what it is I can bear it all 
when I am alone 9 April 20, 1879 ^ sometimes think I can go on no 
longer — what should I not give for my quiet study! I begin to feel 
the wear and tear of life much more than formerly — everything is a 
real effort — one can just do it and that is all 9 
Again as late as December 14, 1881, on the eve of the fifth anni- 
versary of his daughter’s death ‘My darling Georgie — If you were 
here, what could one say — it is always the same weight that crushes 
all thoughts and all words Ever since our dear Ada was taken from 
us, this life has become a mere waiting — one goes on as if it were 
the same as before, but one always feels it is not part of oneself is 
no longer here — and what is here, can only be for a short time 
Let us work on and love on to the last, as our own dear Ada did — 
happy child — that is what I always say when I think of her 9 
It must have been a sore trial for Mrs Max Muller, strong- 
minded woman that she was, to see her husband in this state of 
mind for the rest of his life I am not surprised that in her biography 
she did not give any description of it, and embodied her comment 
m just one sentence But without disclosing his state of mind there 
can be no full understanding of Max Muller’s personality 
Another decisive effect on Max Muller of his daughter’s death 
was his persistent distrust of happiness His third daughter Beatrice 
was happily married to Thomas Colyer-Fergusson, and had two 
children After staying with them in their house, Ightham Mote, 
m 1893 he wrote to his son 'They all seem so happy here that one 
trembles 9 A year later he made the same kind of observation to his

friend Madame Butenschon 'My daughter also, and her husband, 
and her three children, often come to stay with us I ought to feel 
happy, mats la joie fait peur ! ’ 

The fact was that he had lost his faith in life, and when his first 
grandson was bom he could not repress his pessimism, though he 
only gave it a playful form because a new-born child always brings 
with it a rejuvenation of life So he wrote to his new-born grandson 

I am glad you like your Grandmama, I like her too, and I know she 
will be very kind to you, and she will not mind your crying I do not 
wonder at your crying, it is a hard world you enter, as you will find 
out by and by Many people would cry all their lives, if they were not 
ashamed of it And now when you have cried yourself out, try to 
sleep, and forget the beginning troubles of your life Your grandfather 
is trying to do the same, but he does not always succeed 

Not finding it satisfying enough to dwell on his lost daughter in 
thought alone, he began to keep a diary which over the years ran to 
nearly one thousand pages of close handwriting In it he set down 
not only his feelings about her, and expressions of inconsolable 
grief, but also his thoughts on all his interests, including even 
politics, as if he could give utterance to them only in her imagined 
presence There is something infinitely pathetic to find a man of has 
intellect and at the age of fifty-seven addressing an analysis of his 
political opinions and comments to a dead daughter 

I feel more and more as I grow older, how blessed your little life has 
been [he wrote on May 2, 1881] Have you lost more than you have 
been spared ? It is difficult sometimes to have patience with this life 
I feel more and more solitary — frightened almost when I see how I

The whole country [he continued by way of illustrating the dif- 
ference] rings with the praise of Disraeli and abuse of Carlyle Now, 
I have watched Disraeli's career — and I have always felt that he has 
lowered through life the standard of political morality in England 
Expediency was his guiding star through life — nor did he make any 
secret of it — which is a kind of tribute which selfishness, as a hypocrite, 
it is true, but yet as recognizing the existence of higher natures, pays 
to unselfishness. Never has there been, even by accident, a spark of 
generosity from that block of brass, never even an appeal to the nobler

instincts of those whom he addressed, and excited Now, other states- 
men, however discouraging their experience of men may be, have not 
lost all faith in true nobility Gladstone has that redeeming feature in 
him that he believes in ideals, in duty, in unselfishness, in generosity 
I know he has not always been true to himself, but he has tried, and 
those who look at history as it passes before their eyes have again and 
again seen him struggling to be true to his better self To see this keeps 
a belief in morality alive among the people, but to watch a career like 
D’s, destroys all faith in public virtue I know nothing against D’s 
private life, and it speaks well for him that he had had so many private 
friends But a man may have too many friends Woe to you, if all the

All this seems morbid I have seen Hindu women nursing their 
grief, or rather their self-pity, over years with a persistence which 
I have always regarded as perverse, almost unclean So I was 
grieved to see something similar in Max Muller But an introspective 
and analytical mmd like his could not be unaware of the moral 
aspect of his grief and fail to put forward a justification for what he 
was doing He gave one explanation long before his bereavement. 
He had gone on a visit to Queen Victoria at Osborne House, where 
he found the rooms full of recollections of Prince Albert and every- 
one talking about him as if he were still among them Mentioning 
this in a letter to his wife, he also offered his explanation ‘This/ he

would have made our life so bright and happy But we must learn to be 
ready to give up everything, however dearly we love it, when God bids 
us to do so Sooner or later we know we shall have to leave all those

may order it Think always what those whom you loved and who 
loved you on earth, would think of you, and then you will never never 
go far wrong 

Of course, behind all this lay the Christian view of life and death, 
and above all its central doctrine of resurrection In his childhood 
Max Muller had read and pondered the inscription over the gate- 
way of the God's Acre at Dessau where his father was buried 
‘Death is not death, it is but the ennobling of man's nature ’ 
Anyhow, Muller kept his diary for many years I shall give some 
quotations from it He began to wnte in it from December 1876, 
and called the reflective chapters Paroksha in Sanskrit, which can 
be translated as Out of Sight In the third Paroksha , under the date 
February 8, 1877, occurs this cry of agony, at the thought of 
another blow 

Since yesterday morning Wilhelm is ill with scarlet fever I cannot 
gather my thoughts — I cannot I feel after God, that He may help I 
am dumb before him My dear Ada gone — and now God shows me 
again and makes me feel, how we are all in His hand — O God have 
mercy upon me, a miserable sinner f When Thou threatenest, then they 
believe in Thee, says the old poet in the Veda — and is it not so even 
now? How careless my happy life has been — now They terrible 
thunder, O God, has roused me Oh let me never forget God's 
mercy — let me enter upon a new life and remain steadfast in it There 
cannot be many years to live — let me live them in the sight of God 

Feb 10 Wilhelm is better, and now that this dark cloud is passing 
away, the old sorrow returns I feel as if God had intended to remind 
me how much is life to me, how much is still entrusted to me, how my 
life is still blessed above thousands and thousands I shall not forget 
this warning — I shall try to do my duty, but I shall keep a sacred 
place where I can find you, my dear Child, where I can speak to you, 
and be guided by you . 

Feb 17 I often thought, my dear Child, how painful it would be if at 
any time you shall have been brought to think that your father's faith

the distance between my own religious views and yours was great It 
could not be otherwise, and it is difficult to bridge over that distance 
except by love and trust And yet I always felt that you, as a child, and 
I, as a man, were only speaking each our language but meaning the

same There is a difference between the childlike faith of a man (all 
real faith must be childlike) and the childlike faith of a child The one 
is Paradise not yet lost, the other Paradise lost but regained The one 
is right for the child, and the other is right for the man It is the will of 
God that it should be so — but it is also the will of God that we shall 
all bear with each other, and join, each in his own voice, in the great 
hymn of praise

In April, 1883, whilst at Hastings with his family Max Muller got 
a telegram that his mother was seriously ill It was followed by an- 
other which announced her death He at once started for Dessau, 
and arrived in time to be able to bury her He described the illness, 
death and funeral to his wife at length, and wrote about her to all 
her grand-daughters, dead as well as living To his dead daughter 
Max Muller wrote in retrospect in 1885 

My dear Mother — my earliest recollection, my first love — my con- 
stant thought these many years taken away — a tie that bound me to the 
Eternal broken for a time And yet one fears the law of nature and

To his living daughters he wrote immediately To his youngest 
daughter Beatrice he wrote 

As long as my mother lived, I felt that I belonged to her, now I belong 
to no one, though others belong to me You have no idea what a rich 
life hers has been, rich in joys, rich in sorrows, and rich in love and 
sympathy for others In her very last letters to me she was full of 
interest as to your singing She always hoped you would have a voice 
like hers When she was your age she sang at some great musical 
festivals, admired by the best judges 

To his second daughter, now the eldest, the intellectual Mary, 
who w T as engaged to be married to a young Oxford don whom she 
passionately loved, he wrote* 

I wish you had been able to see your dear grandmother once more if 
only as I saw her, sleeping on flowers, covered with palm-branches, 
taking with her some faded tokens of her early happiness, unchanged, 
calm, beautiful It is curious how forgetful we are of death, how 
little we think that we are dying daily, and that what we call life is really 
death, and death the beginning of life, a higher life . Even you, in 
your great happiness just now should feel that what you call your own 
is only lent to you 

The undergraduates who regarded the freedom of Muller’s new 
house at 7 Norham Gardens as one of the best boons of their Oxford 
days, probably did so as much for the daughter as for the father 
One of them, writing an obituary notice of Max Muller after his 
death, reserved his most eloquent passages for Mary He wrote that 
m her c the exceptional physical beauty of both parents reappeared 
m a strangely etherealized form’ He continued , 

She was one of those of whom we all seem to perceive, after they are 
gone, that a hundred mystic signs had always marked them for another 
world than this I can see her still, with her classic head and straight, 
sweet features, with a wreath, in her dark hair, of gold olive leaves 
beaten flat and thin, which had been copied from an Etruscan model 
for one of her wedding gifts — a vision of almost incredible human 
grace, ‘a dream of form in days of thought’ 

This did honour to the undergraduates of Oxford, who showed 
that though they could drown themselves for Zuleika Dobson they

could also rise to an abandoned admiration of a more spiritual 
physical attraction 

Mary was endowed with remarkable intellectual gifts She did 
not know Greek when she was married, and learnt it from her 
husband in the course of six weeks while walking with him on long 
forest and mountain paths in Germany From his lips she learnt 
in that short time declension, conjugation, a considerable vocabulary 
and enough of syntax to be able to construe easy Greek like that of 
Xenophon at first sight 

She was a good linguist, and translated before her death a very 
learned philological treatise by Scherer 

From a very young age she was strong-willed, and offered prob- 
lems to her parents Mrs Max Muller, a strong character, was 
sometimes imperious with her, and her husband remonstrated So 
one finds him writing to his wife on January 13, 1879, when Mary 
was just short of being seventeen 

I am so much afraid you will grow out of harmony with Mary, and I 
sometimes look forward with trembling to the future She is a very good 
girl, so honest, so diligent She is not strong, she has not the feeling of 
health and strength like Beatrice But I feel certain she is full of love 
for us both, only she is shy and fnghtened 
We must not expect our children [he continued] to be exactly what 
we should like them to be They are given us to make the best of we 
can We have to conform to them — we are older and wiser, and can 
bear with them far better than they with us I do not mean that we 
should always yield to them We can be very strict and severe, but 
always show them our love and our real sorrow when we must spoil 
their pleasures If the ways of a mother and daughter once diverge 
they very seldom meet again You know I am not preaching to you — I 
only want to show you a danger You do not always understand Mary's 
waywardness 

I could see all the time that she considered the dress you worked for 
her too showy There is no harm in that, rather the contrary But what 
between seeming to be ungrateful and shrinking from attracting atten- 
tion the poor child did not know what to do Many a grown up person 
would have felt the same difficulty If you had said one word that you 
too thought the dress more showy than you had expected, all would 
have been right But you only put your authority against her taste, and 
thus all your kindness in working the dress for her was lost However, 
I may have said too much, and particularly in writing one seems to say 
much more than one wants to say All I wish is to see you and the 
children happy together, and that you know

Three years later it was the turn of the daughter to be remon- 
strated with On May 5, 1882, he wrote to Mary. 

Now what I had so often to blame you for was being out of tune, not so 
much with me as with your mother — particularly not showing her that 
loving respect that a daughter should show to her mother, thus en- 
nobling a relation which, I believe, forms the highest happiness in life 
Though when you were children, I was sometimes given to be very 
stern with you, your mother has always shown you the greatest kind- 
ness, and far too much of indulgences even — yet you were constantly 
opposing her and even finding fault with her I never doubted your 
heart, but I felt very unhappy about your manner You can say every- 
thing to a father and mother, but you should say it as a child, even 
when you are twice as old as you are now Now whenever you begin 
to express an opinion it was never done in a hesitating or inquisitive 
tone, but always as a determined assertion That seemed so unnatural 
It was almost impossible to argue anything out with you, or exchange 
opinions — because you simply reiterated your opinion and looked 
upon those who differed from you, and who at all events were older 
than you, with a kind of contemptuous smile Now such things jar on 
me like wrong notes , but particularly as I felt all the time that it was 
not real, but only put on It is quite true that I am often absorbed 
m my work, and many of the things which interest you have lost in- 
terest for me Yet I have seldom sent you away, and if I have done so 
I have done it with regret and with kindness, I believe You could 
make the few remaining years of my life much happier, if you would 
take your natural place, helping your mother, cheering your father, 
and practising that self- surrender which is at the root of all true 
happiness because it makes us feel satisfied with ourselves 

This letter from a father aged fifty-nine to a daughter aged twenty 
is very creditable to the former His daughter also caused him some 
worry when she fell in love with a not very wealthy young don, 
Fred Conybeare, and wanted to marry him His own situation in 
respect of his own marriage was ironically reversed On June 7, 
1883, he wrote to his wife 

If he [his daughter’s lover] really cares for Mary, he should show that 
he is worthy of her and capable of an effort and a sacrifice He must 
work and do somethmg, and show what is in him A mere ‘Coach’ 
would not do for her, nor for me You will be sorry if you allow your- 
self to be drawn further and further I know it is difficult to say No to a 
lovesick swam and a lovesick maiden — but I feel certain it is for their

good If F will only work with a will, I do not see why he should not 
marry next year — but if he begins life sighing and dawdling, the chances 
of a happy marriage seem to be very distant As to their income, I 
know they can live on £800 a year — so could one — but whether you, 
and therefore I would be happy is another question Of course, if we 
old people were asked whether we would live on £8oo a year, or not 
live together at all, we should probably say, Let us live on £800 a year — 
but the week after there would be long faces and regrets And so it will 
be with them I know Mary and her ideas of what is nice, and generous, 
and comfortable I should be sorry for Fred if she had to do without a 
maid 1 [Of course, a lady’s maid is meant ] 

However, they were married towards the end of the year Then a 
different kind of anxiety arose for Max Muller — whether Mary 
would be careful enough when expecting a child Less than a year 
after her marriage she had a child, which did not live, and Muller 
wrote to his wife ‘So it was not to be — and the little soul shrank 
back from this life Poor Mary seems to have suffered much, and 
to have no reward for it is very hard ’ 

Two years later she was expecting another child, and was ill 
Hearing about it Max Muller wrote to his wife who was with her 
daughter at Southwold in Suffolk ‘However one must be prepared 
for misfortune ’ 

On September 2, he wrote again ‘When will people learn that if 
women want to be mothers, they must live sensible and natural 
lives On September 4 the following telegram arrived at his house 
for Wilhelm, who was only nineteen, from his mother 
‘To Wilhelm Max Muller, Oxford Mary passed away today in 
long faint Break it to Daddy and Bee Mummy’ 

Mrs Max Muller dared not send the news directly to her husband 
On the last page of the diary is pasted this telegram, and underneath 
Max Muller wrote ‘Friday, September 3, 1886 Mary left us . . ’ 
He wrote no more in that diary His sorrow was too deep for 
expression He gave the news of his fresh bereavement to others but 
thought more of the sorrow of others than his own Thus he wrote 
to Sir Robert Collins, Secretary to the Duchess of Albany ‘I have 
shared many sorrows, and even now, under this new blow, it is the 
misery of that poor husband and the grief of my wife that chokes 
the heart far more than my own distress ’ 

Thirteen years later he wrote to his son* ‘I wonder whether you 
remember the anniversary of today when dear Mary was taken from

ns Who could understand it and account for it * And yet we must 
learn to see a meaning in everything, we must believe that as it was 
it was right 5 

That was the last word of philosophy on death Max Muller’s 
wife was to receive the final blow after his death When she was 
writing his biography the third daughter Beatrice died, and the last 
words of that book were 

'Desolation rests on the earthly home where her father passed so 
many happy hours 

'And yet "Death is not death, if it gives us to those whom we have 
loved and lost, for whom we have lived, and for whom we long to 
live again ”* 


### INDIA MEN
Chapter 3 

INDIA. MEN 

When Max Muller told his son to grow fond of someone or some- 
thing and so be raised to the intensity of a passion, he was thinking 
of his own life Whatever his love for someone might have brought 
him, his fondness for something never disappointed him That was 
India, adopted as a boy's dream and pursued through life as an 
object of love Many people looked upon this as his great illusion 
It could be, for he could create an India of his own, as Pygmalion 
did with his Galatea Though absorbed in India all his life, he never 
visited the country In early life he could not because his mother 
thought that England was far enough His love affair and marriage 
also prevented it In middle age he was too busy at Oxford, and 
when old he felt that a visit to India would be too great a physical 
strain Among Indians the legend grew that he believed their 
country to have been the land of his previous birth, and that to see 
it might prove a fatal shock of joy 

He himself did not think that not to visit a country where lay 
one’s spiritual or intellectual interest was necessarily a great loss 
Learmng that his son had visited Palestine and recalling his longing 
to see the East in his young days, he wrote to Wilhelm on April 9, 
1898 T have had to give up many of these dreams, but somehow 
one learns to see with the mind and imagination what we cannot see 
with the eyes, nay, in many cases I believe imagination is truer 
than what you see. People go to Jerusalem to see the place of some 
of the miracles, and they do not see the greatest of miracles, that out 
of that small town, in a small country, there should have risen a 
light to light the whole world * 

The fact that he had no first-hand experience of India was often 
thrown in his teeth by the Englishmen there, who did not like his 
advocacy of Indians and his enthusiastic evocations of ancient Hindu 
civilization The charitable among them regarded him as too 
idealistic, and the malicious gloated over his disenchantment if he 
were ever to visit the country Referring to this the Statesman of 
Calcutta, one of the leading English language newspapers in India,

direction, wrote on May 10, 1903, in reviewing Mrs Max Muller’s 
biography of her husband 

The conjecture is often hazarded that, had Max Muller seen with his 
own eyes the India of whose people and thought he wrote with so 
noble an enthusiasm and so fine a sympathy, the illusion would have 
fallen from him We cannot think it The man whose insight was equal 
to the task of piercing through all the accretions overlying the Hindu 
scriptures to the pure gold of the idea and the poetry beneath, would 
assuredly have been baffled by no obstacle created by the India we 
know today Beneath and behind the distorting reality he would have 
seen the India of his vision , and, although his theories would have been 
modified, his attitude towards the real contribution which India has 
made to the intellectual life of the world would have remained un- 
changed 

This vindication, so far as it went, was correct But from another 
point of view it was unnecessary For one thing, as will be seen 
presently, Max Muller was not unaware of the actual social, moral 
and religious condition of the India of his time Then, the India he 
idealized, that of the ancient Hindus, could be idealized and made 
proof against disillusionment, for it was reconstructed from certain 
ancient religious and philosophical texts which admitted of a wide 
range of interpretation according to the inclinations of the recon- 
structor, so that no one who differed from him could charge him 
either with ignorance or with intellectual dishonesty Furthermore, 
it is impossible to check the correctness of any such reconstruction 
against concrete historical evidence as to cults and beliefs 

For instance, the religious and philosophic ideas to be found in 
the Rig-Veda and the other Vedas , to take only three principal inter- 
pretations, those of Max Muller, Bergaigne and Keith, there is not 
a scrap of evidence, except the existence of the texts, that these 
ideas formed the basis of the religious life of the Hindus in times 
which properly belong to history The differences in the interpreta- 
tions are due to differences in philological exegesis combined with 
assumptions regarding early religion, and the philological exegesis 
itself is conjectural So Max Muller could create his ancient India 
without being compelled to change his picture ^Actually, he did 
more He imposed his idea of India and of Hindu religion in its 
most ancient form on the religious life of the Hindus of his time 
His picture, which he put before Indians and Europeans alike, 
was built up with the help of a selective principle applied to the

entire body of Sanskrit literature, and the principle led him to for- 
mulate his peculiar view of the historical development of this 
literature He expounded it on different occasions, but expressed it 
most succinctly and clearly in the lectures delivered by him at 
Cambridge in 1882, which afterwards he published under the title 
India * What Can It Teach Us? 

According to him, the whole of Sanskrit literature could be 
divided into two parts one preceding the Turanian invasions, and 
the other following them He used the general term ‘Turanian’ for 
the Sakas or Scythians, Kushanas, and all the nomadic or semi- 
nomadic peoples who came into India and ruled there from the first 
century b c to the third century ad To the pre-Turanian epoch, 
he said, belonged the Vedic literature and the ancient literature of 
the Buddhists To the post-Turanian epoch belonged all the rest of 
Sanskrit literature, whether religious or secular Between the two 
periods he assumed a longish period of literary unproductiveness 
for the Hindus, and called the later literature that of the Sanskrit 
Renaissance 

Moreover, he drew a qualitative distinction between the products 
of the two periods, regarding those of the earlier period as ‘ancient’ 
and ‘natural’, and those of the later as ‘modern’ and ‘artificial’ He 
thought that the literature of the second period was never a living 
and national literature for the Hindus, though it contained relics of 
earlier times. The great mass of it was artificial and scholastic, full 
of interesting compositions and by no means devoid of originality 
and occasional beauty Yet all that held appeal for the Oriental 
scholar alone, and not for the historian, or philosopher with a broad 
human sympathy 

Max Muller set down his deliberate opinion 

It was a real misfortune that Sanskrit literature became first known 
to the learned public in Europe through specimens belonging to the 
second or what I called the Renaissance period Although the 
specimens of this modem Sanskrit literature, when they first became 
known, served to arouse a general interest, and serve even now to keep 
alive a certain superficial sympathy for Indian literature, more serious 
students had soon disposed of these compositions, and while gladly 
admitting their claim to be called pretty and attractive, could not think 
of allowing Sanskrit literature a place among the world-literatures, a 
place by the side of Greek and Latin, Italian, French, English or 
German.

This was virtually falling in with the view of Sanskrit literature 
taken by Mill and Macaulay, quoted in a previous chapter 

‘It is different/ he declared, 'with the ancient literature of India, 
the literature dominated by the Vedic and the Buddhist religions 
That literature opens to us a chapter in what has been called the 
Education of the Human Race, to which we can find no parallel 
anywhere else 5 He further said that anybody who cared for the 
origins of language, thought, religion, philosophy, or law and many 
other human creations 'must in future pay the same attention to the 
literature of the Vedic period as to the literature of Greece and 
Rome and Germany’ 

Knowledge of this period of Sanskrit literature, he said, began 
with Eugene Burnouf, who was not likely to spend his life on pretty 
Sanskrit ditties and wanted to correlate Sanskrit literature to his- 
tory, human history, world history, and laid hold of Vedic litera- 
ture and Buddhist literature as the two stepping stones in the 
slough of Indian literature’ As a result of the study of Sanskrit 
thus inaugurated, something other than a particular literary ex- 
pression was to be found in Sanskrit literature So he wrote 'What 
then, you may ask, do we find in that ancient Sanskrit literature 
and cannot find anywhere else ? My answer is, We find there the 
Aryan man, whom we knew in his various characters, as Greek, 
Roman, German, Celt and Slav, in an entirely new character, a 
character,’ he explained, 'which was the complement of that of the 
Northern Aryan ’ 

He elaborated the idea in a very eloquent passage of his lecture: 

All then that I wish to put clearly before you is this, that the Aryan 
man, who had to fulfil his mission in India, might naturally be defi- 
cient in many of the practical and fighting virtues, which were de- 
veloped in the Northern Aryans by the very struggle without which 
they could not have survived, but that his life on earth had not there- 
fore been entirely wasted. His very view of life, though we cannot 
adopt it in this Northern climate, may yet act as a lesson and warning 
to us, not, for the sake of life, to sacrifice the highest objects of life 

^ There is undoubted truth in the antithesis thus emphasized 
between the activism of the Northern Aryan and the quietism of 
the Southern ,JBut Max Muller did not realize that the first was the 
result of a successful struggle and the second of an unsuccessful and 
hopeless struggle — both against nature. Yet from the historical 



INDIA MEN 


291 


point of view he was not right He was underrating and partly 
rejecting the whole expression of that ancient Indian civilization of 
whose existence we have historical evidence from archaeology, 
inscriptions, art and literary products both religious and secular 
And he was treating as the most important and valuable that part 
which was only prehistoric or protohistonc And even that was only 
by inference rather than by direct historic proof 

His view of the two periods of Sanskrit literature is not historical 
if one excludes the Vedic literature, both in the hymns and the 
liturgical texts, and the most archaic mystical works What he re- 
garded as a Renaissance of Sanskrit literature was most probably its 
first birth The secular literature was certainly a new appearance, 
and even in regard to the religious texts, which he assigned to the 
earlier epoch, we cannot be sure when they received their present 
form Many of them must have done only in the so-called age of the 
Renaissance Besides, he was wrong in thinking that classical San- 
skrit literature was artificial, rhetorical and merely pretty By the 
same criterion the whole of Latin literature might be called artificial ; 
and in English literature Shakespeare, Milton and Pope, not to 
mention others, should be regarded as extravagantly rhetorical or 
conventional Max Muller’s taste in poetry was neither compre- 
hensive nor eclectic He regretted that his Oxford friends often for- 
got that he had been brought up on German poetry and though he 
knew Heme, Ruckert, Eichendorff, Chamisso and Geibel, not to 
speak of Goethe, Schiller, Burger and even Klopstock, their allu- 
sions to Tennyson, Browning, Shelley or Keats were entirely lost 
on him He revealed his preference in poetry by saymg that Tenny- 
son’s In Memonam remained a treasure for life with him 

But the ancient India which he regarded as the highest and most 
valuable was his own creation, and thus immune to disillusionment 
But since he was presenting that India to the Indians of his time in 
order to raise them from the cultural condition to which they had 
reduced themselves, and to revitalize their life, it is quite possible 
that he would have been saddened by the actual conditions, and 
had a feeling of despair had he ever visited India 

A man of Max Muller’s deep and broad humanity could not fail 
to be attracted to the men and women of the country he loved so 
much. In fact, his personal relations with the Indians he met in the 
course of his long life provide the most touching expression of his 
devotion to India I was surprised by the span of time over which he

had either Indian acquaintances or Indian correspondents The 
first Indian he met was Dwarkanath Tagore, born at the end of the 
eighteenth century, and one of his last correspondents was an emi- 
nent Bengali whom I used to meet in Calcutta in the thirties of this 
century In between there were many figures of first rank in modern 
India like Raja Radhakanta Deb, Debendranath Tagore, Keshub 
Chunder Sen, Rajendra Lai Mitra, Bhao Daji, Behramji Malabari 
and K T Telang He particularly sympathized with those who 
were trying to reform Indian religion and social customs, and were 
not only working for the cause, but also suffering for it In doing so 
and championing them, he did not shrink from courting unpopu- 
larity and abuse A full account will be found in the second volume 
of his reminiscences, Auld Lang Syne But my accounts are also 
given from intimate personal correspondence 

The next Indian whom he met was no celebrity, but he had a 
remarkable history of religious struggle One day in 1854 Muller 
was sitting in his room at Oxford copying his MSS, when an Indian 
dressed in a long black coat was shown m, and he addressed Muller 
m a language of which he did not understand a single word Max 
Muller replied in English, and asked in what language he was speak- 
ing The visitor was surprised ‘Do you not understand Sanskrit 
Max Muller said ‘No, I have never heard it spoken, but here are 
some MSS of the Veda which will interest you ’ The Indian read a 
little, and then remarked that he was not able to translate what he 
was reading On Muller’s expressing surprise, the man said that he 
did not believe in the Veda any more, he had become a Christian 
Then he told a remarkable story His Hindu name was Nilakantha 
Goreh, but had been changed to Nehemiah Goreh on his conversion. 
On account of his conversion he had lost all, for even his wife and 
his father had had to repudiate him Goreh had been placed with a 
missionary seminary in London, where he found himself among a 
number of prospective missionaries whom he considered half- 
educated and narrow-minded He did not get any sympathy from 
them, but was blamed for everything he said or did He was treated 
as a kind of nigger by those who should have respected him He saw 
nothing in London that answered his notion of what a Christian city 
should be ‘If what I have been seeing in London is Christianity, I 
want to go back to India , if that is Christianity, I am not a Christian 9 
Muller thought that all this was very ominous After a time his 
friends sent Goreh back to India, feeling that there was a real

293 


danger of his falling into utter despair There, as Muller wrote, what 
seemed to be almost an innate tendency of the Indian mind developed 
m Goreh, and he decided to renounce the world altogether and be- 
come an ascetic Still later he joined the Society of the Cowley 
Brothers which had branches in India On the day before he was to 
leave Oxford he came to see Max Muller for a short while and 
Muller gave the news to his wife on November 3 ‘Now and then the 
old spirit seemed to move in him, but he soon relapsed into for- 
mulas it was sad to see the eagle with broken wmgs ’ 

In his diary Muller wrote 

Last Saturday Nilakantha Goreh called on me 1 It was sad — I had 
not seen him for I suppose 25 years He has become a monk, a Cowley 
Brother* How different from what he was when he stepped into my 
room in Park Place 1 He was then a true martyr, a man who had made 
greater sacrifices for his conviction than any man I knew And now* 
The old fire is quenched 1 ‘We must keep to the Creeds’, he says — he 
who had left father, wife, friends, fortune and home to be free of men 
and creeds [The year is 1877] 

In the biography of Goreh written by a missionary,* he is shown as 
making harsh remarks about Max Muller, and airing contempt for 
his knowledge of Hindu philosophy But Muller in his reminiscences 
of Goreh, written at the end of his own life, had only praise and affec- 
tion for him 

Yet a Hindu Bengali, who was a friend of Goreh and knew him 
intimately, wrote to Muller T really could not understand how a 
man of Mr Goreh 5 s intelligence and learning, who had discarded 
Hinduism, could accept, in its stead, popular Christianity which 
stands on the same level with popular Hinduism By popular 
Christianity I mean the Christianity of the Church, as contra- 
distinguished from the Christianity of Christ 5 
The next Indian whose connexion with Max Muller I shall de- 
scribe was also on a religious quest, but he was not an obscure indi- 
vidual like Goreh He was Keshub Chunder Sen, who, as a religious 
and social reformer, will always have a place in any history of modern 
India He was leading a powerful monotheistic movement, very 
largely modelled on Christianity, and even before he was thirty was 
so famous that Lord Lawrence, the Viceroy, invited him to Simla

as his guest He was a man of extraordinary and almost wild enthu- 
siasm and eloquence, and spoke English as well as he did Bengali 
He was bom into a wealthy and very respected family of Calcutta, 
but had given up, or rather was forced to give up, his family on 
account of his religious convictions However, he gave up his secular 
employment voluntarily, and became a preacher His very young 
wife accompanied him both in his religious mission and his break 
with Hindu society 

Keshub Chunder Sen came to England in 1870, when he was 
thirty-two As Max Muller related in his biographical essay on Sen 
‘His stay in England was a constant triumph 5 He spoke in London 
and all the principal towns, and produced a deep impression on all 
his hearers from all classes of society ‘His name’, Muller added, 
‘became almost a household word in England ’ It should be men- 
tioned that the reception which Sen got in England was partly the 
result of the interest in India, both ancient and modern, which 
Muller himself had created He was also invited to meet Queen 
Victoria 

Max Muller met him for the first time at a luncheon given by 
Dean Stanley, and on April 1, 1870, wrote to his wife ‘We have 
just come back from London, where we had a very interesting lun- 
cheon at the Deanery No one there but Keshub Chunder Sen, and 
the Prince [Leopold, son of Queen Victoria] and I We soon got 
into a warm discussion, and it was curious to see how we almost 
made him confess himself a Christian He will come to Oxford, and 
then I hope to see more of him ’ 

Sen went to Oxford and stayed with Muller, who had a good 
opportunity of watching him, and always found him perfectly 
tranquil, even when very earnest, with his opinions clear and 
settled The highlight of the Oxford visit was Sen's meeting with 
Dr Pusey Pusey was not very pleased with his lectures, and still 
less with his association with the English Unitarians But there was 
a long and serious talk between the two in the presence of Muller, 
who later, when he had to write about Sen, regretted that he had 
kept no record of that interview None the less, he remembered the 
end of the discussion quite distinctly, for it turned on a question of 
his own The point at issue was whether those who were born and 
brought up as members of a non-Christian religion could have sal- 
vation in the Christian sense Pusey did not think so Muller asked 
him pointedly whether at the time of Christ a man who believed 



INDIA MEN 


295 


what Keshub Chunder Sen believed would or would not have been 
received as a disciple He and Sen maintained that he would have 
been Pusey held his ground Much depended on what salvation 
meant, and Sen defined it as an uninterrupted union with God and 
said ‘My thoughts are never away from God my life is a constant 
prayer, and there are but few moments in the day when I am not 
praying to God*’ Dr Pusey was softened by this, and remarked with 
a smile ‘Then you are all right ’ 

In 1878 there came a crisis in Sen’s triumphant religious career 
An offer came from an Indian prince, the Maharaja of Cooch Behar, 
to marry Sen’s eldest daughter, who was not yet quite fourteen 
years old For the sake of succession the marriage had to be accord™ 
mg to Hindu rites Now, idolatrous rites and child marriage were 
the very things which Sen as a religious and social reformer had 
opposed He had made it a rule for his followers not to observe the 
former in any circumstances, and not to marry their daughters 
before they had completed their fourteenth year In fact, an Act 
passed in 1872 had legalized marriages performed according to 
Brahmo rites and fixed the minimum age for it as fourteen 
But Sen fell in with the proposal, and his daughter was married 
to the prince in February 1878, and some subterfuges were adopted 
to satisfy the conscience of Sen At once a storm broke over his 
head Many of his followers had already been offended by his dicta- 
torial ways, and now they accused him of apostasy They seceded 
from his church and founded a parallel one The quarrel was con- 
tinued with extreme bitterness, and Sen’s plea that he had given 
his daughter in marriage to the prince by hearing an adesh or com- 
mand from God, with whom he had communed over the question, 
was treated as pure opportunism 

Max Muller felt distressed at what Sen had done, or rather by 
the manner in which Sen did it But he was not the man to abandon 
a friend for one act of weakness So he wrote to another Indian re- 
former on March 29, 1879 

I have full faith in Keshub Chunder Sen I cannot bear to see the 
unforgiving way in which he has lately been treated He has made a 
mistake, no doubt But even if he had committed a crime, would it be 
impossible to forgive ? Are his judges immaculate ? Do they know the 
temptations of a man placed in so exceptional a position ? He has been 
too kind, too yielding as a father — he has himself acknowledged that 
much That is enough You will never find immaculate saints on earth-

we ought to be grateful when we find an honest man, though he may 
not be free from human weaknesses 

To an English critic of Sen he wrote also T cannot easily give up 
a man whom I once trusted ’ And he wrote to The Times in defence 
of Sen But the English friends of the new Hindu Theists of the 
strictest sect were more unrelenting than the early Christians who 
overlooked St Peter's three denials of Christ 

Sen was deeply touched by Max Muller’s defence, and wrote from 
Calcutta 

My dear Sir, Allow me to thank you most cordially for having said a 
good word for us in The Times I have read your letter with very great 
interest, and thankfully appreciate your heartfelt sympathy with us in 
our trials and difficulties You can hardly imagine the troubles I have 
had during the last two or three years and the grossly false and libellous 
charges brought against me week after week All this I say to you 
privately because you have been good enough to give us your sympathy 
as a friend, and because you have boldly come forward, as few have 
done, to assert publicly that personal feelings lie at the bottom of the 
opposition movement However, God’s will be done 1 

In private Max Muller told Sen what he really thought of his 
conduct In principle he did not object to the marriage between the 
Hindu Maharaja and Sen’s daughter. He even quoted St Paul’s 
words about marriages between pagans and Christians ‘The un- 
believing husband is sanctified by the wife, and the unbelieving wife 
is sanctified by the husband, else were your children unclean, but 
now are they holy ’ He was also honest enough to say that had he 
himself been placed in Sen’s position he would probably have 
acted in the same way But, he said, Sen should have taken his 
friends and followers into his confidence, instead of trying to im- 
pose his choice on them as God’s commandment 

Sen replied that the whole affair was so uncertain, and the 
marriage appeared so improbable until it was a fait accompli , that 
he really had no time to consult his friends He also explained that 
what he called God’s commandment was not ‘supernatural inspira- 
tion’, but a ‘command of conscience’ In plain words, he thought 
that the marriage was providential Tt was very like a political 
marriage, such as you speak of A whole kingdom was to be reformed, 
and all my individual interests were absorbed in the vastness of God’s 
saving economy, or in what people would call public good. The Lord

required my daughter for Cooch Behar, and I surrendered her ’ In 
any case, the Maharaja of Cooch Behar, though he remained Hindu 
in form, became a patron of all the liberal movements in religion, as 
well as other things including cricket 

Sen wrote to Max Muller that the hostility and the attacks of his 
detractors had actually helped the progress of his church e Our 
influence spreads on all sides, and there is far greater enthusiasm 
among us now than in any previous period in the history of our 
church ’ In one sense this was true, for Keshub Chunder Sen was 
giving a form to his movement, now called the New Dispensation, 
which in its public expression fell in line with the traditional 
Vaisnavism of Bengal This consisted in going through Calcutta 
and other towns singing and dancing to the accompaniment of 
drums, exhibiting the maudlin religious enthusiasm of that sect 
This is the exhibition, given on a very miniature scale, which now 
evokes admiration or amusement in Oxford Street, and which I 
have also seen in the United States It was a sort of High Church 
movement among the Hindu Theists, and naturally it drew the 
condemnation of the seceding Theists who were very much Low 
Church It scandalized the supporters of Sen in England, and it 
was described as ‘a combination of dervish dances and Roman 
Catholicism’ 

Max Muller wrote a very sensible letter on this external exhibi- 
tion to Sen’s loyal follower Pratap Chunder Mozoomdar In it he 
wrote 

To tell you the truth, I am not fond of such things , but every religion 
is a compromise between men and children . ♦ There is no real harm 
m shaving one’s hair A man must either shave his hair or let it grow, 
and who shall say which of the two is best? As to leading an ascetic 
life, what harm is there in that ? India is the very country for leading 
an ascetic life, and a man does not there banish himself from society by 
it, as he would do in Europe Pilgrimages too, singing in the open air 
and carrying flags, seem all so natural to those who know the true 
Indian life — not the life of Calcutta or Bombay — that I cannot see why 
people in England should be so shocked by what they call Keshub 
Chunder Sen’s vagaries 

About flag-wavmg by Sen’s followers, Muller, if anything, was 
even more sensible ‘Because he carries a flag, which was the recog- 
nized custom among ancient religious leaders, he is accused of 



298 SCHOLAR EXTRAORDINARY 

worshipping a flag I am sure he does not pay half the worship to his 
flag which every English soldier does to his It often becomes to 
him a real fetish, and yet a soldier, when he dies for his flag, is 
honoured by the very people who now cry out against Keshub 
Chunder Sen, because he honours his flag, as a symbol of his cause. 5 

But what Max Muller more seriously objected to was Sen’s ex- 
treme emotionalism, and he wrote about it to Sen himself But Sen 
replied unrepentantly 

The forms of one nation are apt to be repulsive and even shocking to 
another Our Oriental nature is our apology for the ‘impassioned 
utterances’, the ‘language of excessive veneration 5 , ‘highflown Lan- 
guage 5 , etc , you speak of How can I, my friend, destroy my Asiatic 
nature, how can I discard the language of poetry and emotion and 
inspiration which is my life and nature ? To adopt any other language 
would cost me much effort, would be artificial, mechanical, unnatural, 
and, I may add, hypocritical I must speak as I feel, and you know my 
devotion is, as a rule, extemporaneous Our tears during prayer, our 
fervent and constant apostrophizing, our ascetic habits, our very 
forms of devotion in which we speak of God as one whom we see and 
hear , may be disagreeable to European eyes and ears, but so long as 
they are natural and national, and not affected or borrowed, we need 
not be afraid of serious consequences 

In addition to havmg this sort of enthusiasm ingrained within 
himself as a Bengali, Sen may also quite sincerely have felt that he 
should recast the monotheism he was preaching, which was very 
largely Christian in inspiration as well as spirit, in a national mould 
At the height of the agitation against him, his follower Protap 
Chunder Mozoomdar, who was to take his place after his death as 
the leader of the New Dispensation, and who had a far more power- 
ful intellect than his leader though he remained perfectly loyal to 
him, wrote to Max Muller. 

‘You have watched the agitation on the Cooch Behar marriage 
The agitation began from deeper causes, and ended in deeper oppo- 
sition than a mere protest against the marriage Keshub Chunder 
Sen’s genius is too Western for his own countrymen, and too 
Eastern for yours His mind is so independent and original, so far 
above conventional proprieties of every sort, that long before the 
marriage he had begun to make enemies both inside and outside 
the Brahmo Samaj ’ This was very true The Christian missionaries 
m India too disliked Sen, though, of course, they never persecuted 



INDIA MEN 


299 


him Speaking in England in 1870, Sen had actually said ‘Allow 
me, friends, to say, England is not yet a Christian nation ’ So even 
m 1873, in the course of his lecture on missions delivered in West- 
minster Abbey, Muller said ‘They [the missionaries] feel towards 
Keshub Chunder Sen as Athanasius might have felt towards 
Ulfilas, the Arian Bishop of the Goths, yet what would have be- 
come of Christianity in Europe but for the Gothic races, but for 
those Anan heretics, who were considered more dangerous than 
downright pagans?’ 

In spite of differences of temperament and ways of thinking, 
neither of them lost respect and admiration for each other When 
trying to recuperate in the Himalayas from an illness which led 
to his death, Sen wrote from Simla on July 20, 1883 T am sorry I 
cannot write to you so often as I wish But of this I can assure you, 
that you are often present in my thoughts The affinity is not only 
ethnic, but in the highest degree spiritual, which often draws you 
into my heart and makes me enjoy the pleasure of friendly inter- 
course I forget the distance, and feel we are very near each other 9 

Sen died less than six months later, and Max Muller wrote an 
eloquent and touching obituary notice, which he closed with these 
words ‘As long as there is a religion in India, whatever its name 
may be, the name of Keshub Chunder Sen will be gratefully re- 
membered, as one who lived and died for the glory of God, for the 
welfare of mankind, and for the truth, so far as he could see it 9 

But Muller’s most sincere tribute was paid more than fifteen 
years later when he himself had come very near death Sen’s aged 
mother, hearing of Muller’s serious illness at the end of 1899, 
wrote through hei grandsons to inquire about his health He re- 
plied on November 27 ‘Please to tell your dear grandmother that 
I feel much touched by her sympathy . I miss her son very 
much He was so kind, so gentle, so good a man too, and his 
mother ought indeed to be proud to be the mother of such a man ’ 

Sen was fifteen years younger than Max Muller, and died fifteen 
years before him 

This very incomplete account of Max Muller’s personal relations 
with Indians should mclude his tributes to two remarkable Indian 
women of his time, only one of whom he met Both were heroic in 
every sense of the word. The first of them was Rama Bai, called 
Pandita or Learned, whose Sanskrit leaning had become a legend 
m India. Her life was even more remarkable and might be called an

epic in immature Max Muller wrote of her as the ‘truly heroic 
Hindu lady, in appearance small, delicate, and timid, but in reality 
strong and bold as a lioness’ 

She was the daughter of a very learned Brahmin of an ancient and 
venerated clan, but was born in a forest of the Western Ghats This 
Brahmin had as a widower married Ramabai’s mother when she was 
only nine years old He had tried to teach his first wife, but was not 
allowed to do so by his family because there was prejudice in tradi- 
tional Hindu society agamst educating women He tried again with 
his second wife, and when again opposed, he retired to the wilder- 
ness to be free There the wife grew to be learned, and they had 
three children, one son and two daughters, Ramabai being the 
younger daughter His reputation for learning spread, and students 
began to come to his house He also attracted visitors 

A traditional Hindu teacher could not take fees, but on the con- 
trary had to house and feed his pupils on what support he got from 
generous patrons of learning Ramabai’s father lived in his hermi- 
tage for some time, teaching his son and elder daughter with the 
students Soon the expenses became so heavy that he had to break 
up his home, and began to wander all over India with his family, 
earning a livelihood by reciting or expounding the sacred books in 
palaces or Maths (monasteries) His eldest daughter married, and 
his son and Ramabai helped him in this 

When he died his son supported his widow as well as Rama in the 
same way, but they earned very little Then the mother died, and 
after travelling all over India on foot the brother and sister came at 
last to Calcutta, where Ramabai’s lectures created a sensation But 
a new blow fell The brother died, and left alone she was compelled 
to marry However, her marriage was very happy, and she had a 
daughter whom she named Manorama or Heart’s Joy But after 
nineteen months she became a widow In her desperation she de- 
cided to fit herself for practical work, and in order to get medical 
training, helpless as she was, she decided to come to England She 
scraped together all she had earned by lecturing and translating 
Sanskrit for the government, and arrived there, quite destitute at 
the end of her journey 

With her child and the woman friend who had accompanied her 
she was taken to the Anglican Sisterhood at Wantage, some members 
of which she had known at Poona She told them, however, that 
she would never become a Christian. She paid a visit to Max

Muller at Oxford at the time, and on October 27, 1883, Muller 
wrote to his young son ‘We had a nice visit from Ramabai, a 
Brahmin lady who knows Sanskrit splendidly She knows books 
as long as Homer by heart from beginning to end — speaks Sanskrit 
correctly, and writes Sanskrit poetry Unfortunately she hears very 
badly, and as she came to England to study and take a degree, she 
is very unhappy ’ 

What actually happened, however, was terrible Ramabai’s com- 
panion feared that they might be made Christian by force, and tried 
to strangle her to death to save her from the calamity Failing in this 
she killed herself It was after this that Ramabai came over to stay 
with Max Muller at Oxford Her nervous prostration was such that 
one of Muller’s maidservants had to sleep with her at night Arrange- 
ments were made to enable her to attend medical lectures, but her 
hearing became suddenly worse, and the idea had to be given up 
She then decided to tram herself as a nurse, to do some useful work 
in India 

At this juncture she was invited to America to see the presenta- 
tion of a doctorate in medicine by the Medical College of Penn- 
sylvania to a young countrywoman of hers, who was the first Indian 
woman to take such a degree anywhere, and who had known and 
helped her after her widowhood in India Ramabai went and found 
many friends, who helped her to start a home for young Hindu 
widows in India But in the meantime she had to become a Christian 
because she could not stand alone , she had to belong to somebody 
and somewhere, especially to worship God with those who had been 
kind to her Writing about this Max Muller felt sure that she herself 
would not make any attempts to proselytize among the little widows 
who were entrusted to her, ‘but she lost, of course, the support of her 
native friends and has to fight her battles alone ’ 

In 1887 Muller wrote to the reformer Malabari ‘Try to establish 
schools or refuges for widows Here you might combine with 
Ramabai. I suppose she will soon return to India She has become 
a Christian, but she is not narrow-minded, and may be made useful.’ 
By the end of the century Ramabai had some two thousand widows 
m her home She wrote a very moving book, Life of a High-Caste 
Hindu Woman, describing the treatment of a young Hindu woman 
in the house of her father-in-law. 

The other Hmdu woman to whom Max Muller paid a glowing 
tribute though he never met her, was the friend of Ramabai who had

got the medical degree Her name was Anandibai Joshi She had 
been, married at the age of nine, and had been very happy in her 
marriage So, when asked to speak about child-marriage before an 
American audience, she stood up and defended it, though of course 
only as betrothal albeit binding for life She had seen the suffering 
of young mothers in India, and resolved to take a medical training 
m America, saying, however T will go to America as a Hmdu, and 
come back and live among my people as a Hindu ’ So at the age of 
eighteen she went to Philadelphia with her husband, in spite of 
endless difficulties, and enrolled as a student in the Medical College 
of Pennsylvania 

Dr Rachel Bodley, who received her, wrote about this coming 
‘One day in September 1883, there came to my door a little lady 
m blue cotton saree, accompanied by her faithful friend, Mrs B F 
Carpenter of New Jersey, and since that hour when, speechless for 
very wonder, I bestowed a kiss of welcome upon the stranger’s 
cheek instead of words, I have loved the women of India 5 Anan- 
dibai had very great difficulty in adapting herself to the Western 
way of life, but she got her degree, and was appointed physician in 
charge of the female ward at Kolhapur in the province of Bombay 
Her health however had been undermined, and she died at the age 
of twenty-two in 1887 Though she had technically lost caste by 
crossmg the seas, she was received by all, and when she died all 
Poona mourned with her family Max Muller wrote about this Tt 
shows that even the most inveterate social and religious diseases are 
not incurable when treated with unselfish love and generosity If all 
this could be achieved by a frail young daughter of India, what is 
there that could be called impossible for the strong men of that 
country 

This faith in the men of India was set down by Max Muller only 
a year before his own death No one who has the capacity to love 
deeply and strongly can help extending his love from the general to 
the particular, or from the particular to the general The failure to 
be general denies fullness and breadth, and to a certain extent un- 
selfishness in love, while without particular objects, love is dis- 
embodied and remains only a tenuous exhalation In Max Muller’s 
case love became particular in two ways His love of the idea of 
India and for the ancient civilization of India became more speci- 
fically love for the people of India as a whole, it then became love 
for individual Indians

So what he found most unnatural and vehemently denounced 
m the relationship between India and Britain was the habitual deni- 
gration of the Indian character by those Englishmen who lived in 
India or had first-hand experience of the country Muller set him- 
self not only to defend Indians, but also to show in what way the 
Indian character and outlook could be a complement to those of 
the European So, in the very first of the lectures he delivered at 
Cambridge in 1882, to which he boldly gave the title, India What 
Can It Teach Us he said 

If I were asked under what sky the human mind has most fully 
developed some of its choicest gifts, has most deeply pondered on the 
greatest problems of life, and has found solutions of some of them 
which well deserve the attention even of those who have studied Plato 
and Kant — I should point to India And if I were to ask myself from 
what literature we, here in Europe, we who have been nurtured almost 
exclusively on the thoughts of Greeks and Romans, and of one Semitic 
race, the Jewish, may draw that corrective which is most wanted in 
order to make our inner life more perfect, more comprehensive, more 
universal, in fact more truly human, a life, not for this life only, but a 
transfigured and eternal life — again I should point to India 

Those who have not gone into the history of Indo-Bntish personal 
relations during the most stable days of British rule in that country 
can have no idea what the British contempt and hatred of Indians 
was like By the end of the nineteenth century the Englishman had 
formulated his Thirty-nine Articles of dogma regarding Indians, 
and the first and second Articles were of course that they were all 
liars and all dishonest These assumptions were communicated in 
advance to any Englishman who was going to India as an adminis- 
trator or in any other capacity Generally speaking they were 
accepted even before the Englishman saw the country and its 
people So the English came with a prefabricated hostility 

Before the Mutiny the attitude was one of more or less passive 
contempt But after, an element of fear came into the aversion, and 
sensing the latent hostility of their subjects the British in India 
snarled like frightened beasts of prey When in 1920 a distinguished 
Bengali, who had been raised to the peerage and was then Under- 
secretary of State for India, was justifying in the most moderate 
language in the House of Lords, the cashiering of General Dyer for 
shooting hundreds of Indians at Amritsar, a drunken peer was heard 



304 SCHOLAR EXTRAORDINARY 

to shout ‘If they are all like him, the more they shoot the better ’ 
It must be added, however, that the Indians fully reciprocated the 
hatred No one stated this more clearly than one of the greatest of 
modern Indians, the famous Bengali writer, Bankim Chandra 
Chatterji He wrote in 1873 

If we take up any English newspaper [1 e , a newspaper edited by 
Englishmen in India], we are sure to find somewhere in it some abuse 
of the Natives, some unfair vilification Again, looking into any Bengali 
newspaper, we find as a matter of equal certainty anger against the 
English and denunciation of them In every Indian newspaper there is 
unjust criticism of the English, in every English newspaper the same 
injustice to Indians This has been going on for a long time, there is 
nothing novel about it Conversation in society runs along the same 
lines 

Chatterji accepted this as inherent in the conqueror-conquered 
relationship, and he added that so long as this lasted there could not 
be any lessening of the racial hatred 

Max Muller set himself to fight and if possible to eliminate this 
misunderstanding In his second Cambridge lecture therefore he 
declared that he was going to grapple with a prejudice which was 
more mischievous than ignorance, because it formed a kind of icy 
barrier between the Hindus and their rulers, and made anything 
like a feelmg of true fellowship between the two utterly impossible 
‘That prejudice/ he continued, ‘consists in looking upon our stay 
m India as a kind of moral exile, and in regarding the Hindus as an 
inferior race, totally different from ourselves in their moral charac- 
ter, and, more particularly in what forms the very foundation of the 
English character, respect for truth ’ 

So he devoted the lecture to a demonstration, with facts and testi- 
monies which could not be contested, of the truthful character of 
the Hindus, and he concluded the lecture with the following words 
‘Certainly I can imagine nothing more mischievous, more dangerous, 
more fatal to the permanence of English rule in India, than for the 
young Civil Servants to go to that country with the idea that it is a 
sink of moral depravity, an ant’s nest of lies, for no one is so sure 
to go wrong, whether in public or in private life, as he who says in 
his haste ‘All men are hars ” ’ 

To the end of his life he continued to defend the Indian character 
This championship in the midst of almost universal denigration

earned for Max Muller the gratitude of all Indians, and their 
admiration of him was due no less to it than to his expositions of 
Hindu life and culture Thus, speaking after his death at a meeting, 
R G Bhandarkar, a great Sanskrit scholar and a historian, laid 
greater emphasis on his defence of Indians than on his scholarship 
He said ‘The character of all of us Indians had been greatly tra- 
duced in Europe We were described as men given habitually to 
lying, of no substance or worth in us, possessing no self-respect 
and incapable of any great effort Max Muller combated this 
view ’ 

The lecture provoked decided antagonism among those English- 
men in England or India who professed to know inhabitants of 
India One critic called him a Hindu pervert, but a really scandalous 
sequel followed A leading Sanskrit scholar in England sent a com- 
munication to Indian newspapers accusing Max Muller of intellectual 
dishonesty in defending Hindus against the charge of untruthful- 
ness The first Indian newspaper which published this communica- 
tion did so in the following news story 

A distinguished Orientalist of England, writing to Babu Protapa 
Chandra Roy of this city, the enterprising publisher of the Mahabharata , 
says, ‘It may perhaps amuse you to learn that in the recently published 
German translation of India what can it teach us? the passages in 
praise of Hmdu truthfulness have, with the author's sanction been 
suppressed What will his bosom-friend Dr Rajendralala Mitra say 
to this ? Why, Dr Mitra, when he sees the work thus mutilated, will 
simply say that the learned Professor knows the art of being all things 
to all men at the same time An additional incentive to such sup- 
pression might have been found in the little probability of the Pro- 
fessor’s Hindu friends reading his work in German, especially after 
they had once read it in English 

Clearly, this English Orientalist had the animus of Whitney 
against Max Muller without Whitney’s courage Max Muller could 
guess the identity of the writer, but did not name him He called 
the story a scandalous invention from beginning to end The facts 
were at once communicated to the editor of the Indian paper Max 
Muller had not seen the German translation before its publication 
The German translator had only omitted extracts from English 
writers whose names were less known to German than to English 
readers, because the lectures had to be abridged

Even so the wholesale running down of Indians continued, and 
those who looked upon Indians as an inferior race protested against 
Max Muller’s description of them as biased Muller admitted quite 
frankly that the Indians he had known intimately — Dwarkanath 
Tagore, Keshub Chunder Sen, Behramji Malaban, Ramabai — 
were exceptional beings, who would be so in England as anywhere 
else He was not an indiscriminate admirer of everything Indian 
He had had some unpleasant experiences with the small number of 
young Indians who came to Oxford About one very unpleasant 
experience with them he was driven to write in his reminiscences 
‘These men have a very curious way of blushing If you convict 
them of a downright falsehood, their bright brown colour turns 
suddenly greyish, but their eloquence in defending themselves 
never fades or flags ’ If I had not read the vindication of Hindu 
truthfulness offered by Muller, I should have said that the spirit of 
this remark was not very far from those made by the hardboiled 
Anglo-Indians of his tunes 

What Muller objected to was any sweeping generalization from a 
small number of personal observations He said ‘If I hear a man 
calling all Indians liars, I generally ask how many he has known I 
do the same thing when I hear all Frenchmen called monkeys, all 
Italians assassins, all Germans unwashed, all Russians savages, or 
even England Perfide Albion ’ Besides, he knew that the question of 
Hmdu truthfulness, even when considered on the doctrinal or his- 
torical plane, was extremely complex For instance, in establishing 
the general truthfulness of Hindus he took his stand on the glorifi- 
cation of truth in the sacred books, as well as on the repeated insist- 
ence in them on telling the truth and nothing else Yet he himself 
in Note C to the printed edition of his lectures gave authoritative 
citations from the books of Hmdu sacred law (Dharma Sastras) 
which treated falsehood uttered in certain circumstances as venial 
sms For example, he quoted among many others a passage from the 
Vasistha treatise on law Tf a man speaks an untruth at the time of 
marriage, in sexual intercourse, when his life is in danger, or when 
he is likely to lose all his property, and when a Brahmana is in 
danger, it has been declared that these five untruths are not sms * 
There are, of course, many such passages in all Hmdu sacred texts 
But, on the whole, Max Muller could make out a strong case for the 
Hindu’s love of truth in ancient times from Hmdu scriptures and 
from the testimony of foreign observers such as the Greeks More-

over, since no direct evidence was then available for what the 
Hindus actually did, the didactic insistence on truth created a justi- 
fiable presumption that they were truthful in their conduct 

In respect of the contemporary situation Max Muller had greater 
difficulty, not due to lack of evidence but to the contradiction in it 
The most vocal opinion of the Anglo-Indians, or the British who 
were living or had lived in India, was that Indians were habitually 
and universally given to lying As against them he was in a de- 
cidedly unfavourable position, and he frankly described it 'Having 
never been in India myself/ he said in his Cambridge lecture of 
1882, 'I can only claim for myself the right and duty of every his- 
torian, namely, the right of collecting as much information as 
possible, and the duty to sift it according to the recognized rules of 
historical criticism ’ 

He stated the issue between him and the men on the spot even 
more clearly in his letter to The Times on the Ilbert Bill, which 
appeared in the paper on August 6, 1883 What he said might be 
described as a methodological expose in a nutshell Muller con- 
fessed that he could not claim 'the honourable title of Anglo-Indian*, 
but added that he had read the accounts of the most eminent 
Anglo-Indians of former times, and was acquainted personally with 
many of his time According to him, the Anglo-Indians could be 
divided into two classes’ those who never appealed to their residence 
in India as a title to infallibility, and the others who wrote and 
spoke on Indian subjects like so many Popes 

If you differ from them [he said], they seem to have but one answer 
to all facts and all arguments — namely, 'I have been in India, I have 
spent twenty-five years among the natives — it is all wrong, I know it is 
wrong, and you would not say so if you had been in India ’ 

It makes little difference to these mvmcibles that where they say 
‘Black’ others who have spent quite as many years in India as they 
have, say ‘White’ It only makes them more emphatic, and those who 
may happen to listen, naturally think it rather impertinent that one 
who had never been in India should venture to know more of the 
customs, the prejudices, the laws, and literature of that country than 
one who has ruined his liver and lost his temper by twenty-five years’ 
residence in Calcutta I have not as yet been driven by my Anglo- 
Indian friends to such a pitch of despair as others who have openly 
declared that no one who has been in India is fit to write a history of 
India.

‘Residence in India/ he pointed out, ‘had its dangers as well as its 
advantages ’ Firstly, India is a large country and not even twenty- 
five years in Calcutta, Bombay or Madras would justify an experi- 
enced civil servant in beginning a single sentence with ‘the people of 
India’ Secondly, Anglo-Indians lived in an English environment, 
and when they saw the Indian environment they saw it in a changing 
state due to contact with English influences Thirdly, an observer 
might be too near as well as too far, and nothing was more difficult 
than for a soldier to see the battle in which he is fighting as a whole, 
or for Bismarck to write the history of his time 

It was the privilege and duty of the scholar and the historian, 
Muller declared, to stand aloof, to choose his own point of view, 
and to look at both sides of a question If historians could write 
about the Peloponnesian or the Crimean War without being in 
Greece or Russia, surely a man who had studied the evidence care- 
fully could pronounce an opinion on Lord Lawrence’s or Lord 
Lytton’s government in India ? 

Max Muller based his views about the general truthfulness of 
Hindus on the experience of a large number of eminent Englishmen 
who had intimate knowledge of Indians, and more especially he de- 
pended on the statements of Colonel Sleeman, who as the eradicator 
of the notorious criminal community of the Thugs, (its members 
murdered people by strangling them with a handkerchief), was 
not likely to be ignorant of the darker side of Indian life And 
Muller quotes one of Sleeman’s sayings ‘I have had before me 
hundreds of cases in which a man’s property, liberty, and life has 
depended upon his telling a lie, and he has refused to tell it ’ 

Depending on such testimonies, Max Muller made out a subtle 
and sophisticated case for the truthfulness of the people of India 
He said that in order to judge them fairly the Indian people had to 
be observed where and when they were left to themselves Histori- 
cally, he explained, they could be regarded as left to themselves 
only before the Muslim conquest This conquest was so cruel and 
atrocious that the wonder, to his mind, was how a nation could sur- 
vive such an inferno without being turned into devils themselves 
So the truthfulness of the Hindus could be seen best in ancient 
India, when they were politically independent 

Next, basing himself on the views of Sleeman, he said that 
Indians could be considered to be left to themselves only when they 
were in their village communities He said that Sleeman was one of 



INDIA MEN 


309 


the first to discover the village communities of India, which later 
were described more fully by Sir Henry Maine Sleeman stated 
that lying between members of the same village was almost un- 
known 

Lastly, he pointed out that English opinion about Indians was 
shaped largely by experiences in big cities like Calcutta, Bombay 
and Madras, and that the native elements in such towns contained 
the most unfavourable specimens of the Indian population This 
might be regarded as the moral counterpart of the military opinion 
in India that the best Indian soldiers were not to be recruited from 
the bazaars of the cities Besides, Muller pointed out, any insight 
into the domestic life of the more respectable classes, even in towns, 
was extremely difficult to obtain 

I might add another aspect of the question which Max Muller 
left open, without stating it explicitly The concept of ‘Hindus left 
to themselves’ should also include their loyalty to their own notion 
of Dharma — righteousness, justice or dikaiosyne , or whatever 
European name might be given to it This could be found working 
among rural people The Hindu peasant, despite his worldly propen- 
sities, was also the carrier of a tradition of religious faith and morality 
which was the ancient Hindu spirituality reduced to its lowest and 
simplest, but which was also the heritage of the upper classes before 
British rule If that rule introduced the European moral conscious- 
ness among the Hindus, it also undermined the simple indigenous 
morality The Indian Penal Code and the Evidence Act, introduced 
by the British in India, with all their complexities created more 
falsehood in India than existed before And now the professed 
secularism of the Westernized ruling class in India is dealing the 
last blows to Hindu morality 

Finally, it has also to be said that among us the notion of verbal 
truthfulness was never very highly developed and therefore nobody 
minded a false statement, and often called an incorrect statement a 
he The feeling of moral baseness in lying was roused only in the 
early days of Bntish rule in India when the English word ‘liar’ was 
used, and not when its Bengali equivalent was applied There is an 
amusing scene in an early Bengali farce in which a young man 
rushed to give a beating to his friend who called him a ‘liar’ 
The offender was very much shocked by it, and asked for an expla- 
nation The angry young man replied that had he been called 
mithyavadi (1 e*, liar in Bengali) he would not have minded it at all, 



310 SCHOLAR EXTRAORDINARY 

but to be called a ‘liar’ was unforgivable That shows how foreign 
the idea of verbal falsehood was among us The European influence 
also created the white lie in India, prevarication and casuistry, for 
which before there was hardly any need Therefore one might say 
that Max Muller’s defence of Hindu truthfulness was as well 
founded in one way, as was in another the accusation that we 
Hindus were liars to a man Modern and Westernized Hindus of the 
late nineteenth century did not understand this difference, and took 
Max Muller’s defence of Hindu truthfulness with all its Western 
implications Therefore when Lord Curzon in one of his convoca- 
tion speeches admonished the students of Calcutta University to 
respect truth hn all circumstances’, the whole of educated India 
was scandalized

It has been seen that all the scholarly researches of Max Muller 
had a practical side, or in any case practical implications For in- 
stance, in editing the Rig-Veda he always kept in mind the effect its 
publication might have on the religious life of contemporary Hindus 
He had the same end in view when, after completing his edition of 
the book, he took up the editorship of a gigantic corpus of the 
scriptures of the East under the general title of The Sacred Books of 
the East In addition, he kept himself in touch with all the important 
religious and social movements in India even when they were not 
directly connected with his scholarly work, and tried to promote 
those which he considered progressive In thus involving himself 
m the sphere of action from a distance he certainly produced results 
which were more tangible than those which Plato could bring about 
either at Athens or Syracuse 

But the deepest and most enduring practical effect of his scholarly 
effort was produced by that part of it which for him was the most 
theoretical His work on Comparative Philology had its political 
effect, and gave a specific direction and character to modern Indian 
nationalism 

The contribution made by the European Orientalists to Indian 
nationalism is now recognized by all The Hindus had created their 
own brand of nationalism, a basic chauvinism so to speak, long 
before the coming of European influences to their country For 
example, the great Muslim scholar, Alberum, who made a special 
effort to know them and their religion, recorded at the beginning 
of the eleventh century that ‘The Hindus believe that there is no 
country but theirs, no nation like theirs, no kings like theirs, no 
religion like theirs, no science like theirs They are haughty, foolishly 
vain, self-conceited ’ This megalomania became far more intense 
and unshakable under Muslim rule, and remained a living passion 
under British rule But it had no historical basis, and could not be 
accepted in its traditional form by the Indians who were receivmg a 
Western education They wanted a nationalism which would be 
tenable historically The Orientalists of Europe supplied the

historical basis by revealing to modern Indians their past history 
and achievements Max Muller fully supported all legitimate use of 
history by them As he put it ‘A people that can feel no pride in the 
past, in its history and literature, loses the mamstay of its national 
character ’ But the question was whether the pride was being felt 
rationally At first, by and large, that was the case 

Comparative Philology entered mto the new Hindu nationalism 
less obviously, but its conclusions were an essential ingredient in 
its composition But it has to be pointed out that new science of 
Comparative Philology created in the nineteenth century had its 
political effects in Europe as well Hitlerism was its late and mon- 
strous abortion, and anti-Semitism a deformed and vicious child 
Withal, it created other political movements which were not looked 
upon as illegitimate These were pan-Germanism, pan- Slavism, 
pan-Islamism and pan-Turamsm This was pointed out by Sir 
Henry Marne in his Rede Lecture, delivered before the University 
of Cambridge in 1875 

Sanscntic study has been the source of certain indirect effects, not 
indeed having much pretension to scientific character, but of prodi- 
gious practical importance There is no question of its having produced 
very serious political consequences, and this is a remarkable illustration 
of the fact that no great addition can be made to the stock of human 
thought without profoundly disturbing the whole mass and moving it 
m the most unexpected directions For the new Theory of Language 
has unquestionably produced a new theory of Race 

That people not necessarily understanding one another’s tongue 
should be grouped together politically on the ground of linguistic 
affinities assumed to prove community of descent, is quite a new idea 
Nevertheless, we owe to it, at all events in part, the vast development 
of German nationality, and we certainly owe to it the pretensions of 
the Russian Empire to at least a presidency over all Slavonic communi- 
ties The theory is perhaps stretched to the point at which it is nearest 
breaking when men, and particularly Frenchmen, speak of the Latin 
race 

That Comparative Philology should make an impact on the Indian 
mind was natural, because that impact was nothing more than a 
recoil to an impact of India on the European mind As Sir Henry 
Maine said ‘India has given the world Comparative Philology and 
Comparative Mythology ’ It is easy to see that in saying so he had 
the work of Max Muller in mind In the inaugural lecture which 



INDIA MOVEMENTS 


313 


Max Muller delivered on being appointed to the new chair of Com- 
parative Philology, he brought out the connexion even more force- 
fully I have already quoted the passage from that lecture in which 
he said that ‘a Comparative Philologist without a knowledge of 
Sanskrit was like an astronomer without a knowledge of mathema- 
tics’ In the same lecture he elaborated the actual historical con- 
nexion between the two by saying 'We may date the origin of 
Comparative Philology, as distinct from the Science of Language, 
from the foundation of the Asiatic Society of Calcutta in 1784 
From that time dates the study of Sanskrit, and it was the study of 
Sanskrit which formed the foundation of Comparative Philology ’ 
The connexion between modern Hindu nationalism and Compara- 
tive Philology was implicit in this purely scholarly affiliation, but it 
owed its full development very largely to the manner in which Max 
Muller presented it to his readers For him this branch of philology 
was not solely an inquiry into the origin and nature of language, but 
also a means of exploring the mind of the earliest civilized man, and 
even more especially the mind of the Aryan man He employed the 
phrase ‘Aryan Race’, frequently, and also idealized the ethnic 
group to which he gave this name. So, there is a likelihood of his 
being regarded as what in these days is called a ‘Racialist’ The two 
words ‘Aryan’ and ‘Race’ have become some sort of red rag to con- 
temporary Radicals This makes it necessary to explain what Max 
Muller meant when he spoke of the Aryan Race There was no 
vagueness in his conception at all In 1872, speaking before the 
University of Strassburg, he said 

These two sciences, the Science of Language and the Science of Man, 
cannot, at least for the present, be kept too much asunder, and many 
misunderstandings, many controversies, would have been avoided, if 
scholars had not attempted to draw conclusions from language to 
blood, or from blood to language When each of these sciences shall 
have carried out independently its own classification of men and of 
languages, then, and then only, will it be time to compare their 
results, but even then, I must repeat, what I have said many times 
before, it would be as wrong to speak of Aryan blood as of dolicho- 
cephalic grammar 

Again, in his book Biographies of Words , published in 1888, he 
wrote 



314 SCHOLAR EXTRAORDINARY 

How then shall we tell from language what races had to learn the 
language of their Aryan conquerors or their Aryan slaves ? There is 
no Aryan race in blood, but whoever, through the imposition of hands, 
whether of his parents or his foreign masters, has received the Aryan 
blessing, belongs to that unbroken spiritual succession which began 
with the first apostles of that noble speech, and continues to the 
present day in every part of the globe Aryan, in scientific language, is 
utterly inapplicable to race It means language and nothing but lan- 
guage, and if we speak of Aryan race at all, we should know that it 
means no more than Aryan speech 

Lastly, addressing the Anthropological Section of the British 
Association at Cardiff in 1891, he gave a summary of his views on 
this question from as early as 1847, and declared that ‘the unholy 
alliance between Philology and Physiology’ had hitherto done 
nothing but mischief 

Speaking of his first appearance at a scientific conference at 
Oxford in 1847, he said that at that time it was taken for granted 
that in future Comparative Philology would be the only safe founda- 
tion for Anthropology Linguistic Ethnology was a very favourite 
term used by Bunsen, Pritchard, Latham and others He protested 
against this view even then, and published his formal protest in 
1853 To Bunsen he said that ‘there ought to be no compromise 
between ethnological and phonological science’ 

Curiously enough, he was often supposed to be the strongest 
advocate of a theory which he was attacking He made a frank 
confession, however, in the address of 1891 ‘Perhaps I was not 
entirely without blame, for, having once delivered my soul, I 
allowed myself occasionally the freedom to speak of the Aryan or 
Semitic race, meaning thereby no more than the people, whoever 
and whatever they were, who spoke Aryan or Semitic languages ’ 
He went on to say that as to the colour of the skin, the hair, the eyes 
of those unknown speakers of Aryan speech, the scholar says 
nothing ‘If we step once from the narrow domain of science into 
the vast wilderness of mere assertion, then it does not matter what 
we say We may say, with Plenka, that all Aryas are dolichocephalic, 
blue-eyed, and blond, or we may say, with Pietrement, that ail 
Aryas are brachycephalic, with brown eyes and black hair There is 
no difference between the two assertions They are both perfectly 
meaningless ’ 

Holding these views he found it paradoxical that he, a philologist,

should be presiding over the Section of Anthropology, and justified 
that in two ways First of all, he thought that at some future time 
some connexion might be discovered between philological and 
anthropological facts But he emphasized strongly that anthropo- 
logists should know more about language, and ventured to hope 
that ‘the time will come when no anthropologist will venture to 
write on anything concerning the inner life of man without having 
himself acquired a knowledge of the languages in which that inner 
life finds its truest expression 5 So it will be seen that in respect of 
the relationship between language and ‘race 5 zoologically defined, 
Max Muller held very sound as well as sane views 

Educated Indians of his time who were becoming familiar with 
these philological discoveries and being influenced by the new ideas, 
did not accept or apply them with his scientific spirit On the con- 
trary, they showed every inclination to do so in a manner which 
could have been called racialist But even here it is very important 
to be precise as to the attitude, for the word ‘racialist 5 has become 
a mere pejorative expression without a correct denotation or corn- 
notation 

What is now called ‘racialism 5 is not a zoological or purely genetic 
concept at all, but a psychological one It is nothing but an exagger- 
ated consciousness of group identity based on a common language 
and a common culture, often accompanied by a sense of superiority 
to other human groups, and always by a desire to preserve the 
identity It should really be regarded as an extreme form of national- 
ism, and the quarrel between the racialists and anti-racialists is 
correctly seen as a conflict between nationalism and cosmopoli- 
tanism This form of nationalism is perpetuated by the mental 
inheritance of a community, but it also has a genetic aspect All 
communities with a well-defined sense of identity are overwhelm- 
ingly endogamous, and this endogamy furnishes a kind of genetic 
support to what is really an acquired character The loyalty to the 
psychological identity is always heightened and made aggressive 
towards other groups by any threat to it 

/ The Hmdus certainly had a high degree of group consciousness, 
a sense of unbridgeable difference from all others, and this was 
accentuated by their habit of giving to all their social relation- 
ships and activities a genetic complexion and cast In ancient times 
what might be called Hindu nationalism retrospectively was based 
on their belief that they were ‘Aryas 5 , and as such not only different

from other peoples and communities, but also superior Anyone 
who is at all familiar with Sanskrit literature cannot be unaware of 
this, cannot remain ignorant of what the notion of being Arya 
meant to the Hindu of ancient times 

To begin with, however, the notion of Arya was applied aggres- 
sively to the older population of the country, to the non-Aryan 
internal proletariat But when other foreigners began from time to 
time to invade India and rule the original Aryan conquerors, the 
notion was extended to them From the Hindu point of view these 
foreigners in their original homes began to be regarded as an exter- 
nal proletariat, and were all indiscriminately lumped under the 
name, Mlechchhas or unclean foreigners Only the Hindu was re- 
garded as Aryan, and as the historical memory was wholly lost, 
India was regarded as the only Aryan land This Aryan pride was 
also seen, though not in so intolerant a form, in Persia as well 
before the spread of Islam, and it has been resuscitated there in 
our time 

This Aryan pride ran in the blood of all Hindus and, transformed 
into a dogmatic megalomania and xenophobia, it enabled them not 
only to survive under foreign rule, but also to despise their foreign 
rulers, whether Muslim or British None the less, it hung in the air, 
without any historical basis Comparative Philology supplied that 
basis, and brought into existence a more rational and also a more 
self-conscious Aryanism among the modern Hindus 

This was the positive influence of the ideas derived from Com- 
parative Philology on Indians They had also a defensive applica- 
tion by which the Hindus tried to maintain their national honoui 
against the very vocal British arrogance in India Whether it was 
asserted or assumed, they resented the British attitude, and fell 
deeply msulted by their treatment as inferiors " Comparative Philo 
logy came to their rescue by showing that not only in their lan 
guages, but even ethnically, they were related to Europeans This 
created an immense enthusiasm and confidence among the Hindus 
which was noticed by Sir Henry Maine when he was a Member o 
the Viceroy’s Council in India and Vice-Chancellor of Calcutta 
University Delivering his Convocation address in 1864 in Calcutta 
he said 

Probably, if we could search into the hearts of the more refiner 

portions of the Native Community, we should find their highes

aspiration was to be placed on a footing of real and genuine equality 
with their European fellow-citizens Some persons have told them 
that they are equals already, equal in fact as they undoubtedly are 
before the law Most of you have heard of one remarkable effort 
which was made to establish this position A gentleman, who was then 
a Member of the Government of India, Mr Lamg, went down to the 
Dalhousie Institute, and, in a lecture delivered there, endeavoured to 
popularize those wonderful discoveries in philological science which 
have gone far to lift the hypothesis of the common parentage of the 
most famous branches of the human family to the level of a scientific 
demonstration I do not know that anybody was ever more to be 
admired than Mr Lamg for that act of courage, for I know how ob- 
stinate were those prejudices which he sought to overthrow, and to 
what height they had risen at the moment when he spoke The effect 
produced by his lecture on the Aryan race must have been prodigious, 
for I am sure I scarcely see a single native book or newspaper which 
does not contain some allusion to Mr Lamg’s argument 

Maine was, however, conscious that there lay a risk for the future 
m this enthusiasm He told the students of Calcutta University 
whom he was addressing that though Mr Lamg taught nothing but 
the truth, it was a barren truth Then he explained himself. 

Depend upon it, very little is practically gamed by the Native when 
it is proved, beyond contradiction, that he is of the same race with the 
Englishman Depend upon it, the true equality of mankind lies, noi 
in the past, but in the future It may come — probably will come — but 
it has not come already 

In the meantime [he continued] the equality which results from 
intellectual cultivation is always and at once possible Be sure that it 
is a real equality No man ever yet genuinely despised, however he 
might hate, his intellectual equal 

Indians by themselves tried to reach that intellectual equality 
and also found that mstead of being despised by the Englishman he 
was being hated But at the same time they also went on advertising 
the equality from the presumed common descent In 1874, a Bengal 
writer had an article in the Indian Mirror , a very influential news 
paper edited by an eminent Bengali, in which he brought out th< 
difference that Sanskntic studies in Europe and Comparative 
Philology had made to the British attitude towards Indians He 
said that at the beginning of their rule the British regarded th 
people of India as little better than niggers, having a civilizatioi 



318 SCHOLAR EXTRAORDINARY 

perhaps a shade better than that of the barbarian, but that the dis- 
covery of Sanskrit had entirely revolutionized the course of thought 
and speculation ‘We were niggers at one time We now become 
brethren 5 Then he continued 

The advent of the English found us a nation low sunk in the mire oi 
superstition, ignorance, and political servitude The advent of scholar' 
like Sir William Jones found us fully established in a rank above that oi 
every nation as that from which modern civilization could be dis 
tmctly traced It would be interesting to contemplate what would have 
been our position if the science of philology had not been discovered 
We should know that it is to the study of the roots and inflexions oi 
Sanskrit that we owe our national salvation Within a few year' 
after the discovery of Sanskrit, a revolution took place in the history 
of comparative science Never were so many discoveries made at once 
and from the speculations of learned scholars like Max Muller, the 
dawmngs of many truths are even now visible to the world Com 
parative mythology and comparative religion are new terms altogethei 
m the world 

There was more than a chance that this reawakening of self 
respect among the modem Hindus could lead them astray But the 
immediate result was something which Max Muller both wel 
corned and admired, because it showed a Ime of development whicl 
he himself was urging on Indians The human urge in all hit 
scholarly work was that, becoming aware of their great past anc 
drawmg on their legacy, they would revitalize their contemporar] 
life, and shed the dead wood which had accumulated through th< 
centuries He saw that the process was unfolding both in its destruc 
tive and constructive aspects 

So, as President of the Aryan Section of the International Con 
gress of Orientalists held in London from September 14 to 21, 187^ 
he described the result of the impact made on Indians by the worl 
of European Orientalists and other scholars He summed up th< 
general drift in one significant sentence ‘Thus the religion, th< 
literature, the whole character of the people of India are becoming 
more and more Indo-European ’ He amplified the formula b 1 
saying 

A new race of men is growing up in India, who have stepped, as it were 
over a thousand years, and have entered at once on the mtellectua 
inheritance of Europe They carry off prizes at English schools, tak 
their degree in English Universities, and are in every respect ou

equals With regard to what is of the greatest interest to us, their 
scholarship, it is true that the old school of Sanskrit scholars is dying 
out, and much will die with it which we shall never recover, but a new 
and most promising school of Sanskrit students, educated by European 
professors, is springing up, and they will, nay, to judge from recent 
controversies, they have already become most formidable rivals to our 
own scholars They work for us, as we work for them 

But there was also another side to the movement which Max 
Muller could not see because he did not visit India Sir Henry 
Maine did see it, and it seemed so ominous to him that he thought it 
necessary to warn his young listeners against it in Calcutta in his 
Convocation address of 1866 In 1870 he said that he had had un- 
usual opportunities of studying the mental condition of the edu- 
cated class in one Indian province (Bengal), and had found that 
though this class was so strongly Europeanized as to be no fair 
sample of native society as a whole, its peculiar stock of ideas was 
probably the chief source from which certain influences were pro- 
ceeding Then he added ‘Here there has been a complete revo- 
lution of thought, in literature, in taste, in morals, and in law ’ 

To the young members of this class he spoke about the strange 
dichotomy in their ideology He said that he had no complaint to make 
of the education which they were receiving, but that he could not 
help being disappointed at the use to which they were sometimes 
putting it Tt seems to me that not seldom they employ it for what 
I can best describe as irrationally reactionary purposes ’ He could 
see plainly that the educated Indians themselves did not conceal 
the fact that by their new education they had broken for ever with 
their past, and abandoned much of the customs and creeds Yet, 
he said, he was constantly reading and sometimes hearing elaborate 
attempts on their part to persuade themselves and others, that there 
was a sense in which these rejected portions of their history, usage 
and belief were perfectly in harmony with the modern knowledge 
which they had acquired, and with the modern civilization to which 
they aspired 

There were some Indians, he went on to say, who seemed to have 
persuaded themselves that there was once a time in India wher 
learning was more honoured and respected, and when the career of £ 
learned man was more brilliant, than in British India and unde] 
British rule So that they believed or tried to believe that it waj 
better to be a Brahmin, or a scribe attached to the court of som<

half-mythical Hindu king, than to follow one of the learned pro- 
fessions which the English had created 

He observed that in point of fact there was no one in the hall in 
which he was speaking to whom the life of a hundred years ago 
would not be acute suffering supposmg it could be lived over again 
Then he declared emphatically 

It is impossible even to imagine the condition of an educated Native, 
with some of the knowledge and many of the susceptibilities of the 
nineteenth century — indeed perhaps with too many of them — if he 
could recross the immense gulf which separates him from the India of 
Hindu poetry, if indeed it ever existed The only India, in fact, to 
which he could hope to return — and that retrogression is not beyond 
the range of conceivable possibilities — is the India of Mahratta robbery 
and Mohammedan rule European influences are, in a great measure, 
the source of these delusions 

He also said that a similar mistake was being made by them when 
they called in ingenious analogies and subtle explanations to justify 
usages which they did not venture to defend directly, or of which 
m their hearts they disapproved He saw a tendency on the part of 
the educated classes to defend practices on the ground that they 
served some practical end or, more often, because something super- 
ficially like them could be found in Europe Then he said ‘There 
is no greater delusion than to suppose that you weaken an error by 
giving it a colour of truth On the contrary, you give it pertinacity 
and vitality, and greater power for evil 9 

The warning was not heeded, the tendency grew, and by the end 
of the century a very plausible Hindu apologia was built up, largely 
on the strength of the very ideas and information supplied by men 
like Max Muller This can be seen in the record of a conversation 
that the French literary critic, Andre Chevrillon, had with a learned 
Bengali, the principal of the college at Jaipur Chevrillon found in 
him a fund of enthusiasm for the old metaphysics of the country, 
and he told the Frenchman ‘Within the last five or six years there 
has been a reaction in its favour Under English influence writers in 
Calcutta (the school of Brahmos) have denounced the immoralities 
and follies of the Hindu religion We now begin to recognize that 
under its extravagance is hidden a profound idea, and you will see 
that it is defended by our scholars and thinkers. We aspire to be 
ourselves 9

Chevrillon commented to himself 'Does this Hindu speak truly ? 
Is it possible that India, becoming once more conscious of herself, 
is throwing off the intellectual yoke of England ? Is it possible that 
m the peace enjoyed under English rule, the Hindu brain, so long 
paralysed by Mohammedan oppression, will once more begin to 
work ? And if so, what will come of it ^ 

Lord Curzon as Viceroy of India was also observing the move- 
ment of the Hindu mind, and on receiving a copy of Max Muller’s 
Auld Lang Syne , vol II, wrote to him on July 26, 1899 

There is no doubt that a sort of quasi-religious, quasi-metaphysical 
ferment is going on in India, strongly conservative and even reactionary 
m its general tendency The ancient philosophies are being re- 
exploited, and their modern scribes and professors are increasing in 
numbers and fame 

What is to come out of this strange amalgam of superstition, trans- 
cendentalism, mental exaltation, and intellectual obscurity — with 
European ideas thrown as an outside ingredient into the crucible — who 
can say ? 

Though Curzon was not fully aware of what had actually hap- 
pened, a strong current of Hindu conservatism with a fairly elab- 
orate ideology of its own, intellectually competent in its higher 
expression, had already come into existence, and it had put the liberal 
Hindu movement on the defensive This revivalist movement be- 
came political in the next stage, and pervaded the nationalist move- 
ment Thus it may be said that the transformation Max Muller 
wanted in Hindu life was turned into a channel of which he could 
not approve but which he and his fellow-Onentalists had provided 
His role in this movement was passive and involuntary But he 
deliberately took up the role of adviser and guide to the movement 
of religious reform in India This was natural on account not only 
of his scholarly interest in Hinduism, but also of his deeply religious 
nature He wanted the Hindus to recast their religious life in the 
light of what he was placing before them as its highest expression 
All through his life, in one way or another, he continued his inter- 
pretation of Hinduism, so that all his writing may be described as 
his exposition, direct or incidental, of the religion, and the most 
formal expositions are to be found in his Hibbert and Gifford 
Lectures But from the reformist point of view he stated his 
position most clearly and briefly in a letter to the Duke of Argyll, 
written in 1869 It has to be quoted in full for its importance

It is certainly true that the religion of the Hindus, as far as we can 
gather from their sacred hymns in the Veda, is free from everything 
that strikes us as degrading in the present state of religion and morality 
m India But between the ancient religion of India and the religious 
worship of the present generation there have been several falls and 
several rises Buddhism, in the sixth century before our era, was a 
reaction against corruptions that had crept into the ancient religion 
even at that early time Then, Buddhism, starting with the highest 
aspirations, degenerated into monasticism and hypocrisy, and a most 
rigorous form of the old Brahxnamc religion took possession of India, 
and drove Buddhism out of every corner of the country Smce that 
time there ha\e been several religious reforms, though of a more local 
character, and this makes it very difficult to generalize and treat the 
whole religious life of India as one organic body of religious thought 
Yet so much may be said with perfect truth, that if the religion of India 
could be brought back to that simple form which it exhibits in the 
Veda , a great reform would be achieved Something would be lost, 
for some of the later metaphysical speculations on religion, and again 
the high and pure and almost Christian morality of Buddha, are things 
not to be found in the Veda But, as far as popular conceptions of the 
deity are concerned, the Vedic religion, though childish and crude, is 
free from all that is so hideous in the later Hindu Pantheon 

As to the potentiality for transformation (in the sense of improve- 
ment), Max Muller made a distinction between the natural and 
historic religion, which he described in this letter as national and 
personal He wrote 

With regard to the inevitable decay of religion, a difference ought to be 
made between two classes of religion, national and personal There are 
ancient religions, like that of Greece, and that of India, too, which 
grow up like national languages, where it is impossible to speak of indi- 
vidual influences, because all individual influence is determined by 
the silent and almost unconscious approval or disapproval of the 
community In these religions I think we can watch for a time a de- 
cided progress, a general elimination of what is bad, i e , what is not 
acceptable to the national conscience 

But religions like Buddhism, Mohammedanism, and Christianity 
too, belong to a different class They start with a high ideal conceived 
by a representative man, representative either of a nation or of the 
whole of humanity, and that high ideal is hardly ever realized, it 
has to adapt itself to larger circles and lower levels, and can only be 
kept from utter degeneration by constant effort at reform

It will be seen from this letter that Max Muller had no admiration 
for the pos t-Vedic manifestations of Hinduism, except for the re- 
ligious aspect of the philosophy of Vedanta He never discussed the 
orgiastic and erotic aspects of Hinduism which some writers in the 
West seem now to regard as the brightest light from the East But 
we can guess what his opinion must have been, for he could not have 
remained ignorant of them As to the beliefs and practices of con- 
temporary Hindus, his unfavourable opinion was openly voiced 
In fact, he considered Brahmanism to be dead, and said so in plain 
language in his Westminster lecture on Missions, delivered on 
December 3, 1873 Referring to the Biahmanic religion he said 

That religion is still professed by at least 110,000,000 of human souls, 
and, to judge from the last census, even that enormous number falls 
much short of the real truth And yet I do not shrink from saying that 
their religion is dying or dead And why ? Because it cannot stand the 
light of day 

The worship of Siva, of Vishnu, and the other popular deities, is 
of the same, nay, in many cases of a more degraded and savage charac- 
ter than the worship of Jupiter, Apollo, and Minerva, it belongs to a 
stratum of thought which lsdong buried under our feet it may live on, 
like the lion and the tiger, but the mere air of free thought and civilized 
like will extinguish it A religion may linger on for a long time, it may 
be accepted by the large masses of the people, because it is there, and 
there is nothing better But when a religion has ceased to produce 
defenders of the faith, prophets, champions, martyrs, it has ceased to 
live, in the true sense of the word, and in that sense the old, orthodox 
Brahmanism has ceased to live for more than a thousand years 

Here he was speaking of that form of Hindu religion which 
according to him appeared in India after the degeneration of 
Buddhism and supplanted Buddhism — the form, that is to say, 
which is conventionally described as the Puramc Then he turned 
to Hinduism as it was practised in his time, and went on to say 

It is true there are millions of children, women, and men in India who 
fall down before the stone image of Vishnu, with his four arms, riding 
on a creature half bird, half man, or sleeping on the serpent, who 
worship Siva, a monster with three eyes, riding naked on a bull, with a 
necklace of skulls for his ornament There are human beings who still 
believe in a god of war, Kartikeya, with six faces, riding on a peacock, 
and holding bow and arrow in his hands, and who invoke a god of 
success, Ganesa, with four hands and an elephant’s head, sitting on a

rat Na>, it is true that, in the broad daylight of the nineteenth century, 
the figure of the goddess Kali is carried through the streets of her own 
city, Calcutta, her wild dishevelled hair reaching to her feet, with a 
necklace of human heads, her tongue protruded from her mouth, her 
girdle stained with blood All this is true , but ask any Hindu who can 
read and write and think, whether these are the gods he believes m, 
and he will smile at your credulity How long this living death of 
national religion in India may last, no one can tell for our purposes, 
however, for gaming an idea of the issue of the great religious struggle 
of the future, that religion too is dead and gone 

What Max Muller said about the educated Hindu was only 
partly true If he had mixed with a large number of them, as Sir 
Henry Maine did, he would have found that ‘the educated youth 
of India certainly affect a dislike of many things which they do 
care about, and pretend to many tastes which they do not really 
share’ If Muller had asked his educated Indian whether, gomg 
further than his private scepticism, he was ready to denounce the 
idol-worship openly, he would certainly have heard the argument 
that, however unmeanmgful to him, it was useful for the common 
herd If Muller further asked whether image-worship took place 
m his house, he would have heard the plea that he could not hurt 
the feelmgs of his mother or wife by putting an end to that Muller 
would perhaps have been too polite to ask if the scoffing Hmdu 
himself did not at times descend to this worship and to practices 
much worse, but if he had he would have got only discreet evasion 
However that may be, Max Muller’s view that Brahmanism was 
dead led him into a controversy with Sir Alfred Lyall, whose know- 
ledge of India was both wide and deep He replied to Muller in an 
article in the Fortnightly Review (July i, 1874), and contended that 
so far from being dead Hinduism was very much alive 

Muller replied in the next issue of the Fortnightly Review , and 
tried to explain himself rather than to contradict Lyall He admitted 
that objections raised against his describing Brahmanism as already 
dead had force, and wrote ‘The word was too strong , at all events, 
it was liable to be misunderstood What I meant to say was that the 
popular worship of Siva and Vishnu belongs to the same intellectual 
stratum as the worship of Jupiter and Apollo, that it is an anachro- 
nism in the nineteenth century ’ In support of his position Muller 
quoted Lyall’s opinion ‘That Brahmanism may possibly melt away 
of a heap and break up, I would not absolutely deny ’ This has not

happened, nor is likely to happen In expecting its eventual dis- 
appearance both Max Muller and Sir Alfred Lyall were wrong If 
one is not thinking of becoming , but only of being , Hinduism is what 
the Hindus describe it to be the Eternal Way 

Nevertheless, holding his own view of the religious life of con- 
temporary Hindus, Muller naturally would consider how it could 
be reformed and revitalized In his early days he thought that 
Hinduism could not be reformed, and must be replaced by Chris- 
tianity Thus on August 25, 1856, he wrote to Bunsen from Oxford 
'India is much riper for Christianity than Rome or Greece were at 
the time of St Paul ’ But he added that he would not like to go to 
India as a missionary because that would make him dependent on 
the parsons, and he did not care to go as a civil servant as that would 
make him dependent on the government What he preferred was 
this 'I should like to live for ten years quite quietly and learn the 
language, try to make friends, and then see whether I was fit to take 
part in a work, by means of which the old mischief of Indian priest- 
craft could be overthrown and the way opened for the entrance of 
simple Christian teaching ’ He thought he could manage to go to 
India with Maharajah Dahp Singh, son of Ranjit Singh Dalip 
Smgh, he knew, was much at Court, and it seemed to him that this 
prince, who had become a Christian, was destined to play a political 
part in India 

But of course, nothing came of this, and Muller did not pursue 
the scheme seriously If he had he would have found that it was not 
practical Not that he was wrong in thinking that Christianity would 
appeal to the Hindus, for at that time most educated Hindus with a 
religious bent were feeling the need for a living monotheistic faith. 
But the obstacle to Christianity was not religious, it was political 
and social The British authorities in India were nght in dismissing 
the idea of creating a religious mission for their rule The mere 
suspicion of an interference with religious taboos gave rise to 
serious disaffection among their Hmdu soldiers, and was one of the 
causes of the rebellion next year 

Max Muller subsequently rested his hopes for a religious reform 
m India on the Vedic studies in the West He had already learnt 
about the monotheistic movement of Rammohun Roy, who was 
preaching a new form of Hinduism based on the latest products of 
the Vedic canon, the Upanishads , and had established a monotheistic 
society in Calcutta Rammohun Roy came to England in late life,

and died at Bristol in 1833 He had seen Rosen, the compiler of the 
first printed edition of the Rig-Veda , though a partial one, at work 
on the manuscripts, and told him that instead of wasting his time 
on it, he should study the Upamshads 

In Calcutta, however, some of his followers thought that in order 
to strengthen the movement among the less educated people they 
could not depend solely on the Upamshads , whose doctrines were 
too pure and sublime to suit the gross ideas of common people 
They began to uphold the Vedas as revelation But they soon found 
that the Vedtc corpus was so heterogeneous that as revelation they 
had either to be adopted as a whole or rejected as a whole They 
rejected it formally in 1850 

The lead in this action was taken by Debendranath Tagore, who 
himself had found release from his religious doubts in the Upam- 
shads When he became the leader of the monotheistic society which 
was called the Brahmo Samaj, he thought it necessary to find out 
the real character of the Vedas by sending four young Brahmins to 
Benares to study them at this centre of Hindu learning and religion 
It was upon hearing their account that Debendranath decided to 
make no use of the Vedtc Samhitas for the new monotheism 

Max Muller thought that the sending of the Brahmins might 
have had a connexion with his own work on the Rtg-Veda, and so 
wrote to Debendranath Upon reading the letter, Debendranath 
wrote to Max Muller that he had received no intimation regarding 
Muller’s work on the Rtg-Veda , and that the idea of sending the 
Brahmins to Benares had originated with him independently 

Thus the Vedtc Samhitas , or the Vedas strictly so-called, did not 
form the basis of the Brahmo monotheistic movement, which took 
its stand on the Upamshads Even of them the son of Debendranath 
Tagore, Satyendranath Tagore, who was the first Indian to enter 
the ICS, wrote that his father’s spiritual aspirations were awakened 
and fed by the ‘sublimer portions of those wild treatises \ This was 
as far as the Brahmos in the first stage of their movement would go 
to draw support from the Vedtc texts The Upamshads continued 
to be the theoretical basis of the Brahmo doctrine But spirit and 
liturgy as well as devotions were soon taken over from Christianity, 
and Brahmoism in its spirit though not in its form became an adap- 
tation to Hinduism of Christianity This was due primarily to 
Keshub Chunder Sen, the next leadei of the Brahmo movement 
and a friend of Muller 



INDIA MOVEMENTS 327 

In India the acceptance of the Vedas as a basis for any form of 
modern Hinduism was due to another Hindu reformer, who, how- 
ever, had nothing to borrow from the West This was Swarm 
Dayananda Saraswati, the founder of the Arya Samaj, a very 
nationalistic and somewhat fanatical sect of Hindu monotheists, 
virtually confined to the Punjab and Punjabis He did not know 
English, but he knew the Vedas by heart, and interpreted them in 
his own way He regarded the Vedas as revelation, divinely inspired, 
and supra-human He died in 1883, after the publication of Max 
Muller’s edition of the Rig- Veda, and it was reported that he 
carried the edition with him But in his commentary on the Rig- 
- Veda in Sanskrit he was very hard on Muller He could not 
understand why Mullei cared for the Vedas at all if he did not 
accept their divine origin 

Though Max Muller’s hope that his work on Vedic literature and 
religion would help towards the creation of a new and purer form 
of Hinduism for modern Hindus was not realized, it should not be 
assumed that it made no impact on their religious thought How 
contemporary Hindus regarded his Vedic enterprise has already 
been described Over and above, there is no doubt that his researches 
and ideas acted as a catalyst on the mind of the Hindus More 
especially, his conception of the history of Hinduism, which pre- 
sented an antithesis between its Vedic form and the later so-called 
Puranic form as the most important fact of the evolution, was 
accepted both by liberal and conservative Hindus Though it is no 
longer historically tenable, it still survives in a modified version 
' It is possible that if Max Muller had descended to the claptrap 
about Hinduism ladled out by Western bigots or charlatans of 
Eastern and Hindu spirituality he might have become the founder 
of a school of Hinduism in India But he wholly disapproved of and 
almost despised this Western infatuation with Hinduism, which was 
displayed in his time by Madame Blavatsky in a very assertive form 
Max Muller first heard about her from his Parsee friend, Malabari, 
to whom he wrote in 1879 * *1 was muc h amused at your “theosophic 
Russian countess”. If she would learn Panim while she is in India 
she might do more useful work ’ Soon he knew much more about 
her, and grew suspicious Madame Blavatsky had not gone to India 
to learn, but to teach her version of Buddhism and Hinduism 

She was ignorant of Sanskrit and Sanskrit literature, but was 
proclaiming to the world that Hindu philosophy, particularly that

of the Vedanta and of Buddhism (she could not always distinguish 
one from the other) were infinitely superior to all the philosophies 
of Europe, and even at that time the Brahmans were the depositories 
of the primeval wisdom of the world At one stage she was with 
Dayananda Saraswati, the founder of the Arya Samaj, and she 
declared that between them they would soon promulgate a new 
theosophy which would eclipse all former systems of thought But 
Dayananda was soon disillusioned and would have nothing to do 
with the Polish countess But she founded a Theosophical Society in 
India, with its headquarters at Adyar in Madras 
After her death one of her associates, Colonel Olcott, protested to 
Max Muller, and wanted to know whether he held that there was no 
esoteric interpretation of the Sanskrit Sastras 

Max Muller’s reply was straightforward He flatly contradicted 
that there was anything esoteric in Buddhism, for it was a religion 
for the people at large, for the poor and the suffering and the 
downtrodden He pointed out that Buddha himself protested against 
the idea of keeping anything secret He admitted that there was more 
esotencism in Brahmanism, but even in that there was no such 
thing as an esoteric interpretation of the Sastras These, he said, 
had but one meaning, and all who had been properly prepared by 
education had access to them. 

As to the countess herself, Muller regretted that he had hurt the 
feelings of Colonel Olcott, but he was unmoved as to his general 
judgement He said in a letter to Colonel Olcott written on June 10 , 
1893- 

I felt it my duty to protest against what seemed to me a lowering of a 
beautiful religion Her name and prestige were doing real mischief 
among people who were honestly striving for higher religious views, 
and who were quite willing to recognize all that was true and beautiful 
and good in other religions Madame Blavatsky seems to me to have 
had the same temperament, but she was either deceived by others or 
carried away by her own imaginations 

In India the so-called Theosophy she preached was taken up by a 
number of educated Hindus with somewhat immature ideas about 
religion, especially as proclaimed through the writings and speeches 
of Mrs Annie Besant Max Muller knew that the educated Hindus 
were showing a great readiness to succumb to the Western charla- 
tanry regarding their religion, and he described it in a parable or 
dnshtanta (example) taken from an Indian story

Once there was a man with a peculiar power to grunt exactly like 
a pig, and he made a good deal of money by showing off his power of 
mimicry to the common people In one village where he was giving 
an exhibition, a holy man passed by, who decided to teach a lesson 
to these credulous people He advertised that he would show them 
a better performance, with much better grunting, free of cost 
People flocked to him, and, producing a real pig, he squeezed it to 
make it grunt But the people said Ts that all ? We hear that every 
day, what's there to it ^ And they all went away The sage said 
‘Here is a splendid lesson We seldom care for reality, and always 
go in for imitation ’ 

At that time the counter-charlatanry of the Hindus had not yet 
reached the West and found victims Hinduism in a new form was 
being preached by men like Swami Vivekananda, and it was largely 
Vedantic Max Muller welcomed this preaching As he himself has 
said ‘From what I have seen and read of Vivekananda and his 
colleagues, they seem to me honestly bent on doing good work 9 
But even in Vivekananda’s teaching Muller perceived now and then 
something of the old Blavatsky leaven that had not been entirely 
discarded And on more general grounds he gave an opinion which 
was very sound He looked upon Vedanta as an expression of the 
Way of Knowledge of the Hindus, and did not like the dependence 
of the new preachers on Ramakrishna, who belonged to the Way of 
Love He admired Ramakrishna, and wrote a book on him at the 
end of his life, but he could not approve of the mixing up of Rama- 
krishna’s teaching with the Vedanta As he put the matter 

Vivekananda and the other followers of Ramakrishna ought, however, 
to teach their followers how to distinguish between the perfervid 
utterances of their teacher, Ramakrishna, an enthusiastic Bhakta 
(devotee) and the clear and dry style of the Sutras of Badarayana 
However, as long as these devoted preachers keep true to the Upam- 
shads, the Sutras , and the recognized commentaries, whether of Sam- 
kara or Ramanuja, I wish them all the success they deserve by their 
unselfish devotion and their high ideals. 

But this has not happened so far as the popular reception of 
Vivekananda’s teaching is concerned It has resulted for their 
followers in a personality cult of both Ramakrishna and Viveka- 
nanda 

With the realization that he could not influence the Hindu revival

m the way he desired, Muller’s practical interest in the religious 
life of India took another direction Towards the very end of 
his life he tried to persuade that section of the Hindu monotheists 
who owed their inspiration and zeal largely to Christianity, or at 
all events to Christ, to declare themselves formally as Christian 
That was, of course, that branch of the Brahmos which was led by 
his friend Keshub Chunder Sen, and after Keshub’s death by his 
friend and disciple, Protap Chunder Mozoomdar 

The Hindu theists had a great diversity of opinion regarding 
Jesus and Christianity, ranging from intense hatred on the one hand 
to profound respect and personal attachment on the other Sen 
belonged to the latter group Throughout his life he remained 
devoted to Christ, though in his own way He gave an idea of what 
that was in many of the speeches he made in England during his 
visit in 1870 ‘Why,’ he asked, 'have I cherished respect and rever- 
ence for Christ ? Why is it that, though I do not take the name of 
Christian I still persevere in offering my hearty thanksgivings to 
Jesus Christ He gave his answers 

There must be something in the life and death of Christ — there 
must be something in his great gospel which tends to bring comfort 
and light and strength to a heart heavy-laden with iniquity and 
wickedness 

My first inquiry was, What is the creed taught in the Bible ? Must 
I go through all the dogmas and doctrines which constitute Christianity 
m the eye of the various sects, or is there something simple which I 
can at once grasp and turn to account ? 

I found Christ spoke one language and Christianity another I went 
to him prepared to hear what he had to say, and was immensely grati- 
fied when he told me ‘Love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, 
with all thy mind, with all thy soul, and with all thy strength, and 
love thy neighbour as thyself.’ 

Christ never demanded from me worship or adoration that is due to 
God, the Creator of the Universe 

He places Himself before me as the spirit I must imbibe in order to 
approach the Divine Father, as the great Teacher and guide who will 
lead me to God 

Christ demands of us absolute sanctification and purification of the 
heart In this matter, also, I see Christ on one side, and Christian 
sects on the other 

To be a Christian then is to be Christ-like Christianity means be- 
coming like Christ, not acceptance of Christ as a proposition or as an

331 


outward representation, but spiritual conformity with the life and 
character of Christ By Christ I understand one who said, ‘Thy will 
be done * 

I feel I must love Christ, let Christians say what they like against 
me, that Christ I must love, for he preached love for an enemy 

It was in the light of all this that he said that the so-called fol- 
lowers of Christ were not yet Christian 
After the controversy over the schism in the Brahmo Samaj and 
Max Muller's defence of Keshub Shunder Sen in his letter to The 
Times , the nature of Keshub's adherence to Christianity was dis- 
cussed between them It arose from a complaint by Keshub Chun- 
der Sen about an attack on him by Professor Momer Williams, who 
had replied to Muller's defence About this Sen wrote 

The manner in which he has treated us is so utterly unworthy of 
him, and is marked with such vacillations, wavering, and duplicity, 
that I can have no misgivings in accepting your verdict It seems 
rather strange that Professor Momer Williams, who professes to be a 
devout Christian, should withhold his regard and sympathy from that 
section of the Brahmo community which is most allied to Jesus and 
makes the nearest approach to the religion founded by Him As for his 
arguments, they have been smashed times beyond number In private 
letters to me he professes friendship, and I have simply warned him in 
the most kindly spirit to ascertain facts before rushing into print 

Though Max Muller had his own opinion of Professor Momer 
Williams, he did not wholly condemn him On the other hand he 
tried to make Sen understand why, despite his attitude to Chris- 
tianity, many sincere Christians felt unsympathetic to him In fact, 
it was Sen's Christianity itself which was the cause So Muller him- 
self wrote to Sen that in order to discuss this question he thought 
that a perfect understanding was necessary between the two as to 
the true character of Christ He wrote 

It may seem strange that a son of India, one who calls himself a 
believer in Brahman (the Absolute Spirit), and who therefore, in strict 
theological phraseology, would be called a non- Christian, should have 
given offence to men who call themselves Christians by what seems to 
them language of excessive veneration for Christ Yet it is so, and that 
is why, in the case of some of your critics at least, the objections to 
your deeply impassioned utterances about Christ arise from good and 
honest motives 



332 SCHOLAR EXTRAORDINARY 

The difficulty was Sen’s rejection of the very Kerygma of Chris- 
tianity Muller gave him a rather long explanation according to his 
own understanding of it, which he said would be regarded by many 
theologians of his day as very strange Even so he set it forth, and 
the crucial passage was 

Christianity is Christianity by this one fundamental truth, that as God 
is the father of man, so truly, and not poetically or metaphorically 
only, man is the son of God, participating in God’s very essence and 
nature, though separated from God by self and sin This oneness of 
nature (homoousia) between the Divine and the Human does not lower 
the concept of God by bringing it nearer to the level of humanity, on 
the contrary, it raises the old concept of man and brings it nearer to its 
true ideal 

This was Muller’s interpretation of the notion of homoousia put 
into the Christian creed at the Nicene Council at the suggestion of 
Constantine Then he observed * After these remarks you will better 
be able to understand the danger of speaking of Christ in language 
which carries us back to the panegyrics addressed by pagan poets to 
their gods and idols If you speak of Christ as not perfectly human, 
m His own sense of the word, you make a new idol of Him, and you 
utterly destroy the very soul of His religion ’ 

Sen replied * 

‘There is hardly a syllable in your last epistle which I should 
hesitate to endorse You have said exactly what I should have 
said, only in a more learned and philosophical style So far as your 
intellectual estimate of Christ is concerned I do not think there is much 
difference between us I am so glad and thankful that the Spirit of 
God has helped me to work my way through Hinduism to the point 
where an enlightened Christianity has brought you I have always 
disclaimed the Christian name, and will not identify myself with the 
Christian church, for I set my face completely against the popular 
doctrine of Christ’s divinity 

There the matter rested so far as Keshub Chunder Sen was con- 
cerned More than this he would not concede But eighteen years 
later Max Muller raised the question of the affiliation of the Brahmo 
movement, led by Keshub Chunder Sen, with Christianity In 1899, 
when he was in Germany, he wrote from Ems a long letter to Protap 
Chunder Mozoomdar, making an appeal to him formally to declare 
his community as Christian 



INDIA MOVEMENTS 333 

My dear friend, You know for many years I have watched your efforts 
to purify the popular religion of India, and thereby to bring it nearer 
to the purity and perfection of other religions, particularly of Chris- 
tianity You know also that I have paid close attention to the en- 
deavours of those who came before you, of men like Rammohun Roy, 
Debendranath Tagore, Keshub Chunder Sen, and others, in whose 
footsteps you have boldly followed I know that you have met with 
many disappointments and many delays, but you have never lost heart 
and never lost patience I confess that I have several times felt very 
unhappy about the mischances that have befallen your good cause, 
but even when Keshub Chunder Sen was forsaken by a number of his 
friends and followers, on utterly insufficient grounds, as far as I could 
judge, and again, when he was taken from us in the very midst of his 
glorious work, I never lost faith in the final success of his work, though 
I began to doubt whether I should live to see the full realization of his 
hopes 

He then spoke about what the Brahmo movement had accom- 
plished and what, as he saw the matter, they had still to do 

You have given up a great deal, polytheism, idolatry, and your ela- 
borate sacrificial worship You have surrendered also, as far as I can 
judge, the claim of divine revelation which had been so carefully for- 
mulated by your ancient theologians in support of the truth of the 
Vedas These were great sacrifices, for whatever may be thought of 
your ancient traditions, to give up what we have been taught by our 
fathers and mothers, requires a very strong conviction, and a very 
strong will But though this surrender has brought you much nearer to 
us, there still remain many minor points on which you differ among 
yourselves in your various samajes or congregations Allow me to say 
that these differences seem to me to have little to do with real religion , 
still they must be removed, because they prevent united action on your 
part If you are once united among yourselves, you need no longer 
trouble about this or that missionary, whether he come from London, 
Rome, Geneva, or Moscow They all profess to bring you the Gospel 
of Christ Take the New Testament and read it for yourselves, and 
judge for yourselves whether the words of Christ as contained in it 
satisfy you 

He reassured Mozoomdar about Christian doctrine and organiza- 
tion 

Christ comes to you [he wrote] as He comes to us in the only trust- 
worthy records preserved of him in the Gospels We have not even the 



334 SCHOLAR EXTRAORDINARY 

right to dictate our interpretation of these Gospels to you, particularly 
if we consider how differently we interpret them ourselves If you 
accept His teachings as recorded, you are a Christian There is no 
necessity whatever for your being formally received into the member- 
ship of one or other sect of the Christian Church, whether reformed 
or unreformed That will only delay the growth of Christianity in 
India 

He recalled Sen’s words to him that after all Christ was in many 
respects an Oriental who might be better understood by Orientals 
He also said that he saw nothing in the proclaimed Brahmo creed 
or the view of God held by the Brahmos which was not Christian 
After developing all his points at length, he closed with this earnest 
and eloquent exhortation 

From my point of view, India, at least the best part of it, is already con- 
verted to Christianity You want no persuasion to become a follower of 
Christ Then make up your mind to act for yourselves Unite your 
flock, and put up a few folds to hold them together, and to prevent 
them from straying The bridge has been built for you by those who 
came before you Step boldly forward, it will not break under you, and 
you will find many friends to welcome you on the other shore, and 
among them none more delighted than your old friend and fellow 
labourer 

Mozoomdar did not answer this letter for a long time, but he pub- 
lished it with a public rejoinder from himself, in which among other 
things he wrote about the attitude of the official representatives of 
Christianity in India 

What disconcerts me is the half-expressed contempt which the 
Christian leaders, even of the liberal school, seem to have of the Hindu 
ideal, and spirituality When I express my ardent love for Christ and 
Christianity, they are kindly in sympathy but the moment I say that 
Christ and His religion will have to be interpreted in India through 
Indian antecedents and the Indian medium of thought, I am suspected 
of trying to bend Christianity down to heathenism. 

Later he wrote to Max Muller 

A wholesale acceptance of the Christian name by the Brahmo Samaj 
is neither possible nor desirable, within measurable time, it would 
lead to misconception, which would do only harm But the acceptance 



INDIA MOVEMENTS 


335 


of the Christ spirit, or, as you term it, ‘the essential religion of Christ’, 
is not only possible, but an actual fact at the present moment Liberal 
souls in Christendom will have to rest content with this at least now , 
and let the name take care of itself 

In the meanwhile, Max Muller had fallen very seriously ill, and 
his life was despaired of But as soon as he was recovered a little, he 
wrote a second letter to Mozoomdar, even before receiving his per- 
sonal answer He had seen the Indian papers and had gathered 
from them that his letter had produced a certain impression He 
had been abused for it both in India and in England He wrote 
‘But surely you owe much to Christ and Christianity, your very 
movement would not exist without Christianity One must be above 
public opinion in these matters, and trust to truth which is stronger 
than public opinion However, the name is a small matter Only I 
thought that truth and gratitude would declare in favour of Chris- 
tian Brahmos, or Christian Aryas * 

However, on March n, 1900, less than eight months before his 
death, he again wrote to Mozoomdar ‘You ought to know me 
enough to know that I am not trying to convert you to Christianity. 
If you are not a Christian you must not call yourself a Christian 9 
He repeated that he did not want the Brahmos to jom any existing 
Christian church or sect 

You say there that your country cannot do without Christ — that India 
is Christ’s, and Christ is India’s You speak actually of an Indian 
Church of Christ Now these words can have one meaning only You 
are Christ’s, and in that sense you are Christians, without being Roman 
Catholics, or Anglicans, or Lutherans I do not want you to join any 
existing church or sect, I only wish you to give honour to the name of 
Christ to whom you owe the best part of your present religion 

This was Max Muller’s last testament to India about religion 
There can be no doubt that in this he spoke from the heart But it 
embroiled him with the orthodox and dogmatic section of the 
Anglican Church In the Diocesan Conference held at Oxford in the 
autumn of 1899, the Principal of Pusey House denounced Max 
Muller for his letter to Mozoomdar, and declared that Muller had 
asked the Brahmos to call themselves Christian without believing 
m the central doctrine on which the faith and life of the Church was 
founded

The Rev H J Bidder, Vicar of St Giles and a close friend of Max 
Muller, at once replied to the accusation on behalf of his sick 
parishioner, saying that ‘as one privileged to minister to his closing 
days, and well acquainted with his religious convictions, I cannot 
allow the reckless assertion made against Professor Max Muller to 
go uncontradicted in his own city 5 Some more correspondence 
followed, and Mr Bidder wound up in the Oxford Times with this 
remark ‘Perhaps I ought to have remembered that he enjoys a 
position in the greater world of religious thought — to say nothing of 
mward strength and serenity — which places him beyond the reach 
of attack either from private bigotry or from the Oxford Diocesan 
Conference 5 

But the more dogmatic elements in the Anglican Church were 
from the first prejudiced against Max Muller This prejudice burst 
out in public condemnation of him after his lecture on the Missions 
in the nave of Westminster Abbey on December 3, 1873, at the 
invitation of Dean Stanley 

From the next day Muller began to receive both congratulations 
and vituperation Liddon, one of the most eminent Anglican 
divines of that time, seized his hand and told him T rejoice from 
my heart that you have been helping us ’ Ruskm approved But 
there were others who wholly disapproved of what he said Some 
papers wrote that he should be sent to prison for having brawled in 
church, and after reading some of these an Oxford tradesman 
rushed out when he saw Muller passing and said to him ‘Well, sir, 
when they send you to prison, count on a hot dinner from my table 
every week/ Henry Reeve, the editor of the Edinburgh Review , 
though a friend, wrote to Muller ‘By the law of England, as I read 
it, an unordained person who preaches or lectures in a church is 
guilty of a misdemeanour, punishable with three months’ prison * 
However, Dean Stanley had taken the opinion of Lord Coleridge, 
the Lord Chief Justice, and so Muller could write to his friend 
George Bunsen ‘There is no going to prison yet.’ 

The mam offence was that he deprecated the excessive emphasis 
on the creeds, and also the attempts of some missionaries to uproot 
the converts from their own society In regard to doctrine he had 
said ‘The fundamentals of our religion are not in these poor creeds ; 
true Christianity lives, not in our belief, but in our love — in our love 
of God , and in our love of man, founded on our love of God 9 On this 
Sir Alfred Lyall commented somewhat ironically ‘Missionaries 



INDIA MOVEMENTS 


337 


will even yet hardly agree that the essentials of their religion are 
not in the creeds, but in love, because they are sent forth to pro- 
pound scriptures which say clearly that what we believe or dis- 
believe is literally a burning question ’ 

Max Muller’s relations with other Indian movements have now 
to be considered, though briefly A man of his humanitarian outlook 
could not be indifferent to the social abuses in India, some of which 
were very cruel Earlier in life he had carried on a controversy with 
Raja Radhakanta Deb, whose opinion of the Vedic work of Max 
Muller has been quoted earlier, about the burning of Hindu 
widows, of which the Raja approved theoretically Max Muller 
was puzzled by this, though he had an explanation for it He wrote 

That an educated Hindu should defend the burning of widows seems 
strange , still, if Popes and Cardinals could defend autos-da-fe or the 
burning of heretics, nay even of witches, because the fire would purify 
and save their souls which could not be saved otherwise, why should 
not an Indian Raja have been convinced that the burning of widows 
could not be wrong, believing, as he did, that it was enjoined by a lost 
Sakha of the Veda> and that the poor women could not be saved unless 
they followed their husbands on their heels into another world ? 

He also referred to ancient Teutonic mythology, according to 
which Nanna and Brunhilda were burnt with their husbands 
But in his later life the movement of social reform in which he 
was most interested was the prevention of child marriage in Hindu 
society He had heard of its inhumanity from Rama Bai, as well as 
from his friend the Parsee reformer Malabari Malabari was trying 
to induce the Government of India to stop this by legislation, which 
it was most unwilling to do Its policy was not to interfere with 
Hindu customs and beliefs, and this policy had been formally 
announced in the Proclamation of Queen Victoria to the peoples 
of India So when Malabari wrote to him about his disappointment 
Muller asked him not to consider the battle lost, but also said that 
for the moment nothing more could be expected from the govern- 
ment 

About this custom two questions arose Firstly, whether it was 
sanctioned and made obligatory by the Hindu sacred law, on this 
Muller was positive that no Hindu scripture sanctioned it, and he 
added that no Hindu Pandit now gainsaid his opinion Secondly, 
whether such a widespread Hindu custom should be interfered 



338

with by the government On this too Muller had a definite view 
He was no advocate of social and cultural neutrality on the part of 
the British Government in India He held that Pax Britannic a 
should be supplemented by Lax Bntanmca , and made out his case 
against Hindu infant maruage on the ground of humanity He wrote 
to Malaban on October 26, 1886 

Government does not deserve the name of Government, if it declares 
itself unable to protect each individual subject against personal torts, 
whether sanctioned by customs or not Now, infant betrothal is a tort — 
it is a contract made without consent of one of the parties If therefore 
the party suffers and wishes to be released from an unjust contract, the 
government ought so far to protect him or her Whether the Govern- 
ment is foreign or native, does not matter It is your Government, so 
long as you accept it and enjoy all the advantages of it, and to turn 
round and say that your Government should not prevent and punish 
iniquity is self-contradictory 

He declared emphatically that the ‘custom of infant betrothal is 
unjust, the custom of infant marriage criminal’ But he also knew 
that he would be abused by the Hindus for his opinion, yet he could 
not remain silent, and he said ‘The more my friends in India 
abuse me, the more proud I shall feel If they call you ignorant, 
because you are a Parsee, what will they call me — a mere Mlechchha 
The question came up again in 1890, when Malabari proposed to 
come to England to interest the British Government in his efforts to 
put an end to infant marriage Early in that year Max Muller wrote 
to him, giving his views on child marriage from another angle 

I have never doubted that early marriage is the greatest impediment 
m the natural development of a woman’s character, and I am equally 
certain that your stunted wives and mothers are the chief cause of the 
slow, the very slow social progress in India You have made rapid 
progress in everything else, but you do not know yet what light an 
educated, healthy and thoughtful wife can spread over every home, 
whether rich or poor I have nothing to say about the physiological 
side of the question, but from a psychological point of view, marriage 
at ten, at twelve, even at fifteen, seems to me the surest means to stunt 
the natural growth of the mind in its various phases The law should 
prevent all that is really noxious to physical health, no individual effort 
on the part of men of light and leading in India can effect a change in 
the long-established custom 


INDIA MOVEMENTS 


339 


Later in the year Malabari came to England and established con- 
tacts with leading persons in the country to find out what could be 
done from England to discourage child marriage One of them, 
Lord Northbrook, who was a former Viceroy of India, wrote to 
Muller 

I believe Mr Malabari to be worthy of encouragement, and I am dis- 
posed to think the time has arrived when the question of how far the 
Government of India might so alter the law as to discourage infant 
marriages should be seriously considered by practical men 

Would you support Mr Malabari’s assertion that infant marriage is 
not a Hindu religious institution, but a custom to which no religious 
authority is attached ? 

Muller’s opinion on this subject was, of course, definite He tried 
to establish contacts for Malabari with, for instance, Princess 
Christian, the daughter of Queen Victoria But he also told him 
that, though she had agreed to see him, Malabari should not expect 
her to express any opinion in public, whatever her feelings might 
be about the question Regarding explorations in governmental 
quarters, Muller wrote to Malabari 

Lord Lansdowne has been written to about the enabling clause You 
understand what I mean — a clause enabling a father to keep his 
daughter till the time has come for her to leave her father’s house 
That clause will probably be carried by Lord Lansdowne in Council 
There ought to be no pressure brought to bear on him He ought to be 
allowed to do it himself, spontaneously Any public demonstration to 
bring this about would, under present circumstances, do harm The 
other question, as to raising the age of consent, is much more serious — 
is in fact, a political question, that will have to be fought out openly 
m India 

By that time however social reform had become of secondary 
interest in Indian politics, and the nationalist movement had 
emerged Max Muller watched it from a distance, but did not think 
of intervening in current Indian politics, except on one occasion 
when he thought a deeper issue of Indo-British human relations 
was involved. The occasion was indeed significant, for it not only 
created the Indian National Congress as the organized mouthpiece 
of Indian nationalism, but also brought into being a strong sense 



340

of alienation of the new Indian intelligentsia from British rule 
The occasion was the introduction of the so-called Ilbert Bill, 
technically a bill to modify the Criminal Procedure Code, by Sir 
Courtenay Ilbert, Legal Member of the Viceroy's Executive Coun- 
cil, at the instance of the Viceroy, Lord Ripon It sought to remove 
an anomaly in the judicial system of India which seemed to per- 
petuate a racial discrimination between the British and Indian 
members of the judiciary At that time Indian magistrates and 
judges could not try European (mostly British, of course) accused 
persons in the district courts, though they did so in the capital 
cities of the provinces 

At once there was a furore among the British in India They not 
only started a violent agitation against the bill, but even threatened 
to kidnap the Viceroy and hold him to ransom This resistance was 
encouraged from inside the government even by the members of 
the Indian Civil Service It had a strong backwash in England as 
well What induced Max Muller to join this controversy was a 
report by the judges of Calcutta High Court, which was an implicit 
condemnation of the bill The report was accepted, not as polemics, 
but as a clear, impartial and judicial pronouncement which had to 
be accepted 

This Max Muller disputed in a letter to The Times , published on 
August 6, 1883, refuting the conclusions of the judges paragraph by 
paragraph What surprised him was not so much the loud clamour 
which was taken as a unanimous condemnation of the bill by British 
public opinion both in India and in England, but the number of 
eminent members of the Indian Civil Service and the Indian Army 
who supported Lord Ripon Lord Ripon himself wrote a letter to 
Max Muller, thanking him for his letter On September 3, 1883, 
he wrote from Simla 

Dear Professor Max Muller, I hope that you will excuse me for 
troubling you with a few lines to thank you very much for the able 
letter which you have addressed to The Times in reply to the Report 
of the Judges of the Calcutta High Court upon the so-called ‘Ilbert 
Bill’, and also for the very valuable support which you have given to 
my policy in this country 

I can assure you that I appreciate very highly the assistance with you 
have rendered to me It is a great satisfaction to me to find that the 
course of policy which I am pursuing meets with your approval I have 
need of all the aid which I can receive from England, for I am assailed

here with a storm of bitter and unscrupulous hostility, which you, who 
dwell in a calmer atmosphere, can scarcely realize 

Believe me, 

Yours faithfully 
Ripon 

Muller thanked the Viceroy, and said that his letter was evoked 
by the fear that The Times ‘would go on quoting that Opinion of 
the Judges as unanswerable, till people who did not take the trouble 
to read it would believe that it was so' The bill was passed finally 
with a compromise clause under which a British accused could 
demand half the jury to be European The agitation left a permanent 
legacy of misunderstanding with Indians 

However, Max Muller was a realist, and he disapproved of the 
eagerness of educated Indians to get into the Indian Civil Service, 
that is, to be employed in the administration at the highest level on 
a footing of equality with the British members of the Service So 
he wrote to his friend Malabari on September 5, 1884, when the 
question of the equality of Indians with the British in all matters of 
government was provoking a particularly bitter agitation He wrote: 

With regard to your countrymen, I wonder that they care so much for 
the Indian Civil Service If I were a Hindu, I should look out for very 
different work to benefit my countrymen To tell you the truth, I do 
not believe in the efficiency of a mixed Civil Service Oil and water will 
not mix — let the oil be at the top, there is plenty of room for the water 
beneath 

On the whole, Max Muller immensely admired British rule in India, 
and looked upon it as a political tour deforce His description of it in 
his reminiscences was very graphic 

The government of India by a mere handful of Englishmen [he wrote] 
is, indeed, an achievement unparalleled in the whole history of the 
world The suppression of the Indian Mutiny shows what stuff English 
soldiers and statesmen are made of If people say that ours is not an 
age for Epic poetry, let them read Lord Roberts's Forty-one Years in 
India When I see in a circus a man standing with outstretched legs on 
two or three horses, and two men standing on his shoulders, and other 
men standing on theirs, and a little child at the top of all, while the 
horses are running full gallop round the arena, I feel what I feel when 
watching the government of India One hardly dares to breathe, and

one wishes one could persuade one’s neighbours also to sit still and 
hold their breath If ever there were an accident, the crash would be 
fearful, and who would suffer most? Fortunately, by this time the 
people of India know all this 

He felt too that under the British Parliament’s rule, the Govern- 
ment of India was not what it was under the East India Company 
The motive power, he said, had passed from the highest authority in 
India to people ‘at home’ , by which he meant that India had be- 
come enmeshed in British party politics He even felt that ‘Mill, 
who was so much abused for his defence of the old East India 
Company, was right after all, and that it was a misfortune for India 
when it was drawn mto the vortex of party government’ 

After the Ilbert Bill Muller laid the blame for the disturbed 
political atmosphere in India partly on the Opposition, and said 
‘There are some politicians who would not shrink from saying, 
“Perish India, if only we can oust Gladstone 1 ” What India wants, 
and will want for many years to come, is rest and quiet work ’ He 
considered the British residents in India even more responsible 
As he wrote to Malabari in 1884 ‘The fault, however, lies not with 
you, but with the new race of English settlers in India Unless they 
are taught how to behave, and kept under control by a strong hand, 
government in India will become impossible the whole blame 
for the present disturbed state falls on the English settlers in India, 
and on the scheming politicians in England ’ In this he was right 
But Max Muller was not yet prepared to envisage an India inde- 
pendent of British rule Considering the renewed political dissatis- 
faction among Indians in 1896, this time over the cost of the Indian 
troops sent to Egypt, he wrote to Malabari 

I wish there was more English feeling in India, and that it would show 
itself in words and deeds What is the use of haggling over the pay of 
an Indian regiment in Egypt? It is a mere nothing compared with the 
true interests, the peace, and prosperity of India I can understand 
Indian patriots who wish to get rid of England altogether, but those 
who see what that would mean should take to their oars manfully, and 
pull a good English stroke You are in the same boat — you can float 
together, and you would go down together So it strikes me, though 
you know that I am generally on the Indian side 

It has to be added that in expressing this kind of opinion at the 
end of the century, Muller was not saying something with which the

greatest Indians of the age did not agree Bankim Chandra Chatterji, 
who is regarded as an apostle of Bengali nationalism and revolu- 
tionary activity, tried to drive the moral home in his famous novel 
Ananda Math, namely that British rule in India was providential 
Before him the great Indian reformer Rammohun Roy, who is 
looked upon as the precursor of Indian nationalism, had said to 
Victor Jacquemont that ‘India requires many more years of English 
domination so that she may not have many things to lose while she 
is reclaiming her political independence 5 

Max Muller also pleaded for leniency to those who were con- 
sidered to be dangerous extremists among the nationalist leaders 
m India So, when the famous nationalist Tilak was imprisoned for 
sedition in 1898, he put his signature to a petition which urged 
consideration to be shown to him Muller wrote to Sir John Lub- 
bock explaining why he spoke for Tilak 

My interest in Tilak is certainly that of a Sanskrit scholar, for though 
I do not agree with the arguments put forward in his Orion , or Researches 
into the Antiquity of the Vedas (Bombay, 1893), I cannot help feeling 
sorry that we should lose the benefit of his labours I sent him my 
edition of the Rig - Veda , but I am told now that he is not allowed to 
read even his Bible and Prayer-book in prison You see, from the 
wording of the petition, that we do not question the justice of the sen- 
tence But the warning has now been given, and none too soon, 
though I do not believe that there is any sedition lurking in India at 
present, not even in the hearts of such men at Tilak 

Max Muller was in his fundamental inclinations an enthusiast, 
and remained one till his last day But what was equally pronounced 
m him as an intellectual was his balance of mind and capacity to see 
both sides of any question He could thus support British rule in 
India and also champion India and Indians 


### VANAPRASTHA
Chapter 5 

VANAPRASTHA 

The heading of this chapter is a Sanskrit word, which means to a 
Hindu the stage of life to be spent in a forest as enjoined by his 
sacred law This is the third state , the two preceding it are Brah- 
macharya (education and observance of chastity) and Garhasthya 
(family life), and that following Vanaprastha is Sannyasa (wander- 
ings as a vagrant ascetic) Max Muller described the state in the 
following words in one of his books 

Then followed the third stage after a man had fulfilled all his duties, 
had performed all necessary sacrifices, and had seen the children of his 
children Then and then only came the time when he might retire from 
his house, give up all that belonged to him, and settle somewhere in 
the forest near, with or without his wife, but still accessible to his 
relations, and chiefly occupied in overcoming all passions by means of 
ascetic exercises, and withdrawmg his affections more and more from 
all the things of this life 

During that third station, that of the Vanaprastha or Hylobtos , the 
mind of the hermit became more and more concentrated on that 
higher philosophy which we call religion, and more particularly on the 
Vedanta , as contained in the Upamshads, and similar but later works 
Instead of merely dipping into the waters, the philosophical baptism 
became then a complete submergence, an entrance into life with 
Brahman, where alone perfect peace and a perfect satisfaction of man’s 
spiritual desires could be found 

When I speak of the Vanaprastha of Max Muller I have this 
spiritual quest in mind, and the description is wholly applicable to 
the last twenty-five years of his life He himself seems to have had 
the notion that the highest utterances of Hindu philosophy were 
sent out by the sages in their station of Vanaprastha As he wrote to 
Renan in 1877 ‘The Upamshads and the Vedanta , if looked into 
seriously, contain, I believe, the solution of many difficulties which 
perplex our philosophy. Only it is not enough to translate them, 
they require the shoulder of a Chnstophorus to carry them over the 
channel of two thousand years that runs between the old Vana- 
prasthas and us ’

For the rest, Max Muller did not intend to abandon the world or 
its duties and obligations He did not even give any public exhibition 
of grief So those who came to see him could not have any inkling of 
the crushing sorrow which had undermined his will to live, though 
not his tenacity in work To the world at large he showed a cheerful 
and at times even a gay manner, and never failed in courtesy, sym- 
pathy and hospitality He even extended his social life When his 
daughter Mary left school in 1880, for her sake he received much 
more company at home, and this enabled him to see more of the 
younger members of the university One of them, Henry Newbolt, 
wrote long afterwards 

I have seldom met anyone so entirely different from my imagination 
of him as Mr Max Muller I had pictured a burly, bearded German 
Professor, carelessly dressed, possibly brusque in manner, certainly of 
unavoidable learning, the author of all those books 

This figure still lies — without its label — in some back cupboard of 
my mind , the gracious and genial presence of the real man could never 
be pieced on to it As to the books, I hardly feel sure who wrote them 
after all , I never heard anything of them from the true Max Muller I 
remember talks on music, dogs, poetry, Hindu ceremonies, pictures, 
sweetmeats, and fairy tales never a professorial or pedantic word 

Newbolt also wrote that only once did he hear Muller speaking of 
religion with a guest, and that was when he was staying at Norham 
Gardens in August 1885 He talked in the garden with great vivacity 
of Darwin and Haeckel, and when the guest went into the house 
Muller turned upon Newbolt, looking up with a flash through his 
gold-rimmed glasses and burst out Tf you say that all is not made 
by design, by Love, then you may be in the same house, but you are 
not in the same world with me I * * * 5 That was, of course, the gauntlet 
thrown down by the teleologist to those who say that emergences 
are brought about by wholly accidental permutations and combina- 
tions Newbolt’ s more vivid memory was of the lover of dogs 

I can see him now, standing at the window, when a picnic day had 

turned out wet, grumbling, not to us but to the dogs, Waldmann and 

Nannerl, and in a manner most sympathetically dog-like I see him, 
too, genuinely disturbed over the absence of Nannerl, sallying out late 

at night to find the prodigal, with a lantern like a figure in one of 

Richter’s charming prints, or Hans Andersen’s tales.

The historical pedigree of these two dachshunds was a favourite 
topic with him When an American scholar, Ethelbert D Warfield, 
Principal of Lafayette College, came to see him, Muller related that 
three types of dogs were plainly distinguished on the pyramids, and 
among them was the type to which these highly specialized dogs 
belonged 

Another acquaintance, describing his life at Oxford, wrote that 
Max Muller was usually at his best as a host , especially at All Souls, 
where this writer said T recall him upon a warm April day, “m 
such a time as comes before the leaf”, but when the tall windows of 
the college hall were thrown wide open to an expanse of emerald 
English turf, bordered by a blaze of jonquils, and Pyrus japomca, 
enthusiastically doing the honours of that stately place ’ 

In 1894 when he was over seventy an interviewer wrote of him 
‘The Professor, for all his long laborious years, retains the vigour 
and vivacity of youth His manner of speech is rather that of a frolic- 
some undergraduate than of the typical University Don ’ That was 
the picture painted of him when he attended the Students 5 Club 
meeting in Glasgow while delivering his third Gifford Lecture The 
journal of the students reported him as saying 

I have tasted a little of the professorial life of Glasgow, but this is the 
first time I have shared its student life, and I feel a student at Leipzig 
once again Later in the evening [the report continues] Mr Mac- 
Laren sang Die Wacht am Rhein , and Mr Buchanan Rhine Wine at the 
request of Professor Muller On their conclusion, he asked the com- 
pany to join him in singing a song, known in every college in the 
world — a song that had come down for hundreds of years, the Gau - 
deamus igitur The Professor then took his seat at the piano, and in 
grand style led the splendid old song, the company joining with the 
greatest heartiness 

I have read a number of Gifford Lectures, and could never 
imagine that anyone could have the energy to do such a thing after 
delivering not one but a series of three lectures 
Max Muller’s courtesy and hospitality were particularly marked 
towards foreigners As Henry Newbolt wrote to Mrs Max Muller 
‘This quamt simplicity, the charm of the perfectly child-like 
character, always seemed to me the one un-English part of him It 
carried with it the power, which we as a nation lack, of entering 
with ease and sincerity into relations, however sudden and unex- 
pected, with strangers or foreigners 5

He was always ready to wecome Indians, whether known or un- 
known Young students and visitors were received into his house 
with the same courtesy as he showed to the most distinguished 
figures from India One of them wrote to Mrs Max Muller after 
his death ‘I do not know whether you still remember it, but I had 
the pleasure and privilege of passing a few hours in the company of 
your late illustrious husband in the middle of May 1882, at your 
hospitable residence in Oxford To you and to your husband it was 
only one of the numerous visits Indians of all castes and creeds, of 
all shades and colours, paid to the great Rishi of Oxford, but to me 
it has been one of the most memorable incidents of my whole life * 
Even immediate sorrow would not prevent him from receiving 
an unknown Indian In 1886, soon after the death of Max Muller’s 
daughter Mary, a Bengali came to see him at Oxford, and he left 
the following description of the visit in his travel diary, published 
in 1889 His name was Trailokya Nath Mukharji This is what he 
wrote 

So one day in November 1886 I rang the visitor’s bell at the door 
of his cottage in the suburbs of Oxford * Mrs Max Muller herself 
opened the door An elderly gentleman of venerable appearance soon 
appeared in the passage, who received me with the utmost kindness 
It needed not an introduction to tell me that I stood in the presence of 
the man who would vie with Sayanacharya and Yaska in his profound 
love of Vedic learning, and with Pamm in his power of critical investi- 
gation and intelligent collation of facts Still I asked ‘Have I the 
honour to speak to Professor Muller He quietly said ‘I am that indi- 
vidual ’ Then we sat for a long time in his cosy drawing room where a 
cheerful fire was burning, but, alas* deep sadness reigned over the 
whole house The Professor constantly talked of India and the Hindus 
for whom he has the deepest sympathy and love He told me that 
although his body lived in England his mind and soul were in India 

Distinguished foreign visitors were always coming to his house 
to see him or to stay with him Among those who came during the 
last twenty-five years of Muller’s life were Renan, Darmesteter and 
even Turgenev from Paris, the Grand Duke of Baden, the Crown 
Prince of Sweden, a Red Indian chief named Strong Buffalo and 
Prince and Princess Christian The well-known American author 
Oliver Wendell Holmes came in 1886, and Lowell, the American

critic who represented his country in England as Minister, came 
often 

Max Muller felt that he had a moral obligation to his foreign 
visitors As the American scholar Dr Warfield put it Tt seemed as 
though the foreigner enjoyed an especial welcome in that home 
Perhaps it was because he remembered the time when he, too, was 
a stranger in a strange land , remembered the loneliness of his own 
lot, remembered, too, and sought to return, the kindness which 
had been shown to him ’ 

It was during this station of Vanaprastha , as I have called it, that 
he turned out all his major works of scholarship and thought, with 
the exception of the first edition of the Rig-Veda and his volumes on 
the Science of Language Work was a matter of habit and principle 
with him, and after the death of two of his daughters it had become 
a refuge from sorrow, though often he longed for rest 

The major work of editing which he undertook was the series 
The Sacred Books of the East , and the original contributions to 
science and scholarship were his books on religion, mythology and 
thought Besides, he had the habit of continuously revising and 
rearranging his older works, and these often called for very strenuous 
work 

Quite early in life he had laid down for himself a systematic 
programme of philosophical inquiry, and he described it in the 
preface to the two volumes on the science of mythology, published 
at the very end of his life in 1897 In it he said that he had planned 
as the work of his life an exposition, however imperfect, of the four 
sciences of Language, Mythology, Religion and Thought, ‘following 
each other in natural succession, and comprehending the whole 
sphere of activity of the human mind from the earliest period within 
the reach of our knowledge to the present day 9 He elaborated the 
assumptions underlying this programme in these words 

There is nothing more ancient in the world than language The history 
of man begins, not with rude flints, rock temples or pyramids, but with 
language 

The second stage is represented by myths as the first attempts at 
translating the phenomena of nature into thought 

The third stage is that of religion or the recognition of moral powers, 
and in the end of One Moral Power behind and above all nature 
The fourth and last is philosophy, or a critique of the powers of 
reason in their legitimate working on the data of experience

He had already put in a comprehensive form what he had to say 
about three of these, namely language, religion and thought, in the 
following books 

I The Science of Language, two volumes, last edition, 1891 
II The Science of Religion, 

1 Introduction to the Science of Religion, 1870 

Hibbert Lectures 

2 The Origin and Growth of Religion, 1878 

Gifford Lectures Four Series 

3 Natural Religion, 1888 

4 Physical Religion, 1890 

5 Anthropological Religion, 1891 

6 Theosophy or Psychological Religion, 1892 
III The Science of Thought, 1887 

To this is to be added his translation of Kant’s Critique of Pure 

Reason , with an introduction by Muller himself 

He wanted to supplement these by presenting his systematic 
view of mythology, but at first felt that he did not have the time and 
strength needed for it in the midst of other work But at last he was 
almost provoked to write the book by the continuous attacks on his 
views on this subject by critics who said that they were completely 
out of date He took all this almost as a personal challenge, and in 
1897 brought out his Contributions to the Science of Mythology in 
two massive volumes, running to a total of 864 pages 

Some account must be given in this chapter of his dealing with 
religion, thought and mythology But before that it is necessary to 
describe another editorial undertaking of his, the publication of 
The Sacred Books of the East , which finally ran to forty-nine 
volumes # It occupied him over the last twenty-five years of his life 
m collaboration with specialists and fellow-workers in many 
countries 

Soon after he had published the sixth and last volume of his 
Rig-Veda (1874), the idea of supplementing this work with trans- 
lations from the sacred writings of other religions, as a compre- 
hensive source for the study of religion, entered his mind The first 
reference by him to such a project is to be found in a letter to the 
Sinologist Legge, which he wrote on February 13, 1875 In it he 
informed Legge that he was trying very hard to get a number of 

* One index volume was added later, and it was compiled by Dr Wmtermtz

scholars together for making translations of the other sacred 
writings, but at the same time expressed the fear that it might not 
be an easy task The same year the project became more concrete 
He received an invitation from the Austrian Government to trans- 
fer his services to Vienna and to publish a series of translations as 
envisaged by him under the auspices of the Imperial Academy It 
was this proposal which, apart from personal reasons, lay behind his 
decision to resign from his chair at Oxford But, as has been related, 
his friends saw to it that he should get the time and facilities to 
carry out the project at Oxford 

He at once prepared a prospectus of the series, and sent it to all 
those who might be interested in the project He had already en- 
sured the support of a number of scholars, but many more had to 
be found Looking at the matter from the point of view of the trans- 
lators, he said that the work could be undertaken by them at a 
certain sacrifice, for they must leave for a time their own special re- 
searches He also observed that ‘there was the most serious difficulty 
of all, a difficulty which no scholar could remove, viz , the difficulty 
of finding the funds necessary for carrying out so large an under- 
taking * However, through the interest taken in it by Lord Salisbury, 
who was for some time Secretary of State for India, Sir Henry 
Maine, a former member of the Viceroy’s Executive Council, and 
Dean Liddell, Vice-Chancellor of Oxford, it was decided to publish 
the series at the expense jointly of the University Press and the 
Government of India 

Twenty-four volumes were contemplated, and they were to be 
apportioned between six religions two from India, Hinduism and 
Buddhism; two from China, Taoism and Confucianism; Zoastrian- 
ism from Persia, and Islam The Christian and Judaic scriptures, 
though eastern in their origin, were excluded for fear of offending 
orthodoxy, and even the publication of the others gave offence to 
many English Christians Progress at fiist was slow, but three 
volumes of The Sacred Books of the East were published in May 
1879, and were dedicated to Lord Salisbury, Sir Henry Maine, 
and Dean Liddell, ‘to whose kind interest and exertions this attempt 
to make known to the English people the sacred books of the East 
is so largely indebted’ 

When the first three volumes were being bound Max Muller 
was provided with a very striking and significant ‘motto, figure- 
head, flag’, as he described it (I will call it a manifesto), for the

whole senes by a lady who at the time was only a casual acquaint- 
ance of his but was to become a close friend She was Lady Welby, 
who was very much interested in religious and philosophical ques- 
tions She had heard of the project and had been roused to great 
indignation by the accusations that in publishing the series, which 
she called a ‘signal service’ to religion, Max Muller had only wished 
to discredit Christianity One day, looking through her book- 
shelves, the first book she drew out was the work of a seventeenth- 
century divine, Bishop Beveridge (1636-1707), entitled Private 
Thoughts on Religion Almost the first passage that caught her eyes 
was one which she thought was strikingly applicable to the work 
Muller had undertaken 

The general inclinations which are naturally implanted in my soul to 
some religion, it is impossible for me to shift off [wrote Bishop 
Beveridge], but there being such a multiplicity of religions in the 
world, I desire now seriously to consider with myself which of them all 
to restrain these my general inclinations to 

Indeed there was never any religion so barbarous and diaoohcai, but 
it was preferred before all other religions whatsoever, by them that did 
profess it , otherwise they would not have professed it 

And why, say they, may you not be mistaken as well as we ? Especi- 
ally when there is, at least, six to one against your Christian religion, 
all of which think they serve God aright, and expect happiness as well 
as you 

I am resolved to be more jealous and suspicious of this religion, than 
of the rest, and be sure not to entertain it any longer without being 
convinced by solid and substantial arguments, of the truth and cer- 
tainty of it That, therefore, I may make diligent and impartial inquiry 
into all religions and so be sure to find out the best, I shall for a time, 
look upon myself as one not at all interested in any particular religion 
whatsoever, much less in the Christian religion; but only as one who 
desires, in general, to serve and obey Him that made me, in a right 
manner, and thereby to be made partaker of that happiness my nature 
is capable of 

She at once sent the passage to him, and called afterwards She 
herself described that meeting:

was exactly what was wanted, and if it had reached me but a few hours 
later it would have been too late As it was, I had to wire to the binder 
to stop work 

Completing The Sacred Books of the East was like extending the 
principle of criticism of life formulated by Plato to religion and 
belief Max Muller certainly thought that the corpus of the religious 
texts he was preparing would not only bring criticism into the 
study of religion, but also revalidate religion by means of the same 
criticism Muller wrote a detailed exposition of the aims in the first 
volume of The Sacred Books , which contained his translations of 
some of the TJpanishads Only a summary can be offered here 

The basic aim was quite clearly historical Muller thought that 
the texts might be of use to theologians, and might also help 
missionaries by giving them an accurate knowledge of other reli- 
gions, as indispensable to them as is the knowledge of an enemy 
country to a general Nevertheless, he explained, the texts had 
assumed quite a new importance in his time as historical documents 
He declared that it could not be emphasized strongly enough that 
the chief interest of these books was historical, and only the historian 
would be able to understand the important lessons which they 
taught 

But, in order to be of value to the historian, a very strict principle 
of selection of the texts had to be followed, and the limitations of the 
translations frankly recognized The principle was that the texts or 
passages translated should not be one-sided, presenting only the 
brighter aspects of the religions dealt with, and that they should 
never omit what could appear as primitive, crude, childish and even 
repulsive to modern readers There was nothing Max Muller dis- 
approved of more strongly than uncritical admiration, and especially 
of the Eastern religions 

In his introduction he referred to the books which had already 
been published in which these texts were described as full of pri- 
meval wisdom, religious enthusiasm and also sound and simple 
moral teaching He observed that this illusion had to be dispelled 
and the study of the ancient religions of the world had to be placed 
on a more sound and truly historical basis 'The time has come/ he 
said, 'when the study of the ancient religions of mankind must be 
approached in a different, less enthusiastic, more discriminating, 
m fact in a more scholar-like spirit ’ 



VANAPRASTHA 


353 


In the report on the progress of the series which he submitted to 
Dean Liddell in 1882, he emphasized the principle even more 
strongly in the light of the criticism of his editing 

I have been blamed for not making this Series of Sacred Books more 
attractive and more popular, but to do so would have been incompatible 
with the very object I had in view in publishing these translations I 
thought the time had come when the ancient religions of the East 
should be studied in their own canonical texts, and that an end should 
thus be put to the vague assertions as to their nature and character, 
whether coming from the admirers or the detractors of those ancient 
creeds To have left out what seems tedious and repulsive in them 
would have been to my mind simply dishonest, and I could have been 
no party to such an undertaking The translations as here published, 
are historical documents that cannot be tampered with without destroy- 
ing their value altogether 

Even so he was attacked for suppressing some of the objectionable 
sides of these religions In 1886 the Bishop of Colombo wrote to 
Max Muller about the method of presenting the Buddhist Vmaya 
texts by omitting to reproduce the parts which could be regarded as 
objectionable A journal in India violently attacked him for giving a 
false idea of the real character of some of the Buddhist teaching 
These charges were repeated by Professor T in Lmdsay of 
Edinburgh 

Whatever might have been his editorial decision in regard to 
particular passages, Max Muller had laid down the general principle 
governing the inclusion or exclusion of what might have been re- 
garded as obscene details in the introduction to the first volume In 
it he said 

There are in ancient books, and particularly in religious books, frequent 
allusions to the sexual aspects of nature, which, though perfectly harm- 
less and innocent in themselves, cannot be rendered in modern lan- 
guage without the appearance of coarseness We may regret that it 
should be so, but tradition is too strong on this point, and I have there- 
fore felt obliged to leave certain passages untranslated, and to give the 
original, when necessary, in a note 

But he felt that on the whole he had tried not to suppress the out- 
spoken simplicity of the ancient man, because he felt that this man 
as he really was, that is, as an animal with all the strength and weak- 
nesses of an animal, must be studied in all his aspects

As to his general attitude, he rather feared that his fellow-workers 
would think that he had used very strong and irreverent language 
with regard to the ancient sacred books of the East But he justified 
his approach by saying that in the days of anthropological research 
when no custom was too disgusting to be recorded, it would be 
strange if the few genuine relics of ancient religion which had been 
miraculously preserved should be judged from an aesthetic, and not 
from an historical point of view 

After setting down this caution for those who might expect to 
find nothing but gems in the sacred books of the East, he went on to 
describe the difficulty which mthe best circumstances might prevent 
a full and accurate understanding of these books Translations, he 
said, could never take the place of the originals, because they could 
never be more than an approximation of one language to the other 
Then he observed ‘The translator, however, if he has once gamed 
the conviction that it is impossible to translate old thought into 
modern speech, without doing some violence either to the one or to 
the other, will hardly hesitate in his choice between two evils He 
will prefer to do some violence to language rather than to misrepre- 
sent old thoughts by clothing them in words which do not fit them * 
He illustrated his principle later in his report to Dean Liddell by 
describing his method of translating the Upamshads , which were 
not only obscure but also repellent in many places He wrote 

If, as has been pointed out, my translation often differs so widely from 
previous translations as to seem hardly based on the same original text, 
this is due chiefly to my venturing to steer a course independent of 
native commentators I have little doubt that future translators of the 
Upamshads will assert their independence of Sankara’s commentary 
still more decidedly Native commentators though indispensable and 
extremely useful, are so much under the spell of the later systematic 
Vedanta philosophy that they often do violence to the simplest 
thoughts of ancient poets and philosophers. 

By the beginning of 1882 fourteen volumes of The Sacred Books 
had been published, eight more were in the press, and the transla- 
tion of the remaining two of the first senes of twenty-four was 
sufficiently advanced to be ready by 1884. So Max Muller thought it 
necessary to put before the Delegates of the Clarendon Press and 
the Secretary of State for India the question of continuing the work 
m a second series, as was the wish of a large number of scholars

whom he had sounded He could also say that, though the first 
series was not launched as a commercial proposition, the sales had 
been such that not only the recoupment of the expenditure by the 
Clarendon Press, but also a profit could be expected 

But objections to the undertaking, as has already been mentioned, 
had been raised from the start The translations had been welcomed 
by Dr Pusey himself, and Lord Lytton, as Viceroy of India, had 
formed an opimon on them which he expressed to Muller in a letter 
written in 1885, after his retirement ‘Your own enterprise/ he 
wrote, ‘with The Sacred Books of the East is colossal It takes one’s 
breath away Never was an Introducteur des Ambassadeurs on so vast 
a scale, nor with such great personages dependent on his good offices ’ 
But the orthodox of the narrow type persisted in their opposition 
Nevertheless, the second series was sanctioned Max Muller’s 
faith in the undertaking was founded not only on its historical im- 
portance but also on an assessment of its general significance for 
religion, and was as unwavering as it was firmly asserted Even in 
1879, when only the first volumes had been published, he had 
written to Lady Welby ‘Of one thing I feel very certain, that this 
translation of The Sacred Books of the East , which some of the good 
people here consider most objectionable, will do a great deal to- 
wards lifting Christianity into its highest historical position I look 
forward to the time when those who objected to my including the 
Old and New Testaments among The Sacred Books of the East will 
implore me to do so ’ 

After the second series was sanctioned he wrote even more con- 
fidently In a letter to Renan on April 21, 1883, he described the 
opposition, explained his own stand, and incidentally sought the 
support of the great French scholar 

The first series of twenty-four volumes is nearly finished, and when I 
proposed the second series, mes amts les ennemis did all that they could 
to prevent it They have not succeeded, and the second series will 
appear, but I shall be glad of an authoritative voice like yours to tell 
the English public the real purpose of the undertaking Most of my 
English critics say ( Les Bibles de Vhumamte ne sont pas amusantes* 
Certainly not 1 they are not amusing, on the contrary, they are the very 
saddest books to read But they must be read, they must be meditated 
on, if we want to know what kind of creature homo sapiens is 

Then followed a passage which might be described as Muller’s 
credo for the series 



356 SCHOLAR EXTRAORDINARY 

The Bibles were considered by him [homo sapiens] as the best he 
could produce as superhuman and Divine , let that be one lesson But 
there is another, and a more cheerful lesson , amid all this scoria there 
are the small grams of gold — be good, be true, be patient, trust — the 
same everywhere, in the highest and the lowest religions, and these 
grams are the quod semper 3 quod ubique, quod ab omnibus , which will 
form the eternal religion of the world These Sacred Books of the East 
will become in future the foundation of a short but universal religion, 
they will remain the most instructive archives of the past, studied or 
consulted when thousands of books of the day are forgotten, and yet 
my wise friends say C ce n 3 est pas amusant 3 ? 

Finally he observed that it reflected great credit on the Oxford 
University Press and the Secretary of State for India that they had 
not been frightened by the vulgar clamour ‘A few words/ he 
added to Renan, ‘from you to the Academie des Inscriptions would 
be a great help to them and to me So if you could find time for 
saying a few weighty words, I should feel grateful 9 
When the two series were nearmg completion, his Indian friends 
sent him an address of appreciation signed by Hindu Pandits, to 
which distinguished Indians of all religions added their signature 
In it they spoke of The Sacred Books in these words 

Your series of The Sacred Books of the East is calculated to generate 
and strengthen in the mmds of those who read it a conviction that 
God’s ennobling and elevating truth is not the monopoly of any par- 
ticular race It unfolds the gradual evolution of religious thought, the 
different stages of which were developed by different races or by the 
same race at different times It has already communicated a strong 
impetus to the unifying movement alluded to above, and we are glad 
to observe that the philosophic writers of England have begun to avail 
themselves of the information therein laid before them. 

The next year there was one Anglican divine of great spiritual 
sensitiveness who conveyed his impression of the value of The 
Sacred Books He was Archdeacon Wilson, who wrote in January 16, 
1894: ‘Science has discovered much in the Victorian era, but I 
think that no discovery will bear such lasting fruits as yours, and 
your great edition of The Sacred Books of the East So in case the 
new year finds you lonely and discouraged, I send you a word of 
thanks and love from this smoky, foggy town of Rochdale ’ 

While Max Muller was carrying on this vast task of compiling a 



VANAPRASTHA 


357 


source-book of religion, he was also giving out his own ideas on the 
nature and history of religion, thought and mythology in a series of 
impressive books Some of them were lectures printed in book form 
Max Muller was never slipshod or obscure in the presentation of his 
ideas On the contrary, his expositions were always striking by 
means of their style It is, however, not always easy to present all 
ideas so as to be intelligible to everybody, because some ideas are 
intrinsically difficult to grasp, and not even always accessible to 
reason without the help of intuitive sympathy This difficulty 
would face the reader when reading Max Muller's more abstruse 
books 

His first important series of lectures were the Hibbert Lectures 
on religion, delivered from April 1878, and published in book 
form immediately afterwards These Hibbert Lectures On the 
Origin and Growth of Religion as Illustrated by the Religions of India 
were delivered in the Chapter House of Westminster Abbey The 
whole series was finished in three months 

Shortly before the day of the first lecture Max Muller got a telegram 
from the Chapter that 1,400 applications had been received for 
tickets (which were gratis), while the hall could hold only 600 So, 
not to disappoint those who wanted to hear him, he lectured twice, 
morning and afternoon Of the first lecture a leading paper wrote 
‘The place, the lecturer, and the occasion were all alike remark- 
able Under the shadow of one of the noblest buildings ever raised 
by medieval Christianity, an Oxford Professor came forward to 
deal with the deepest problems of historical religion in the “dry 
light 5 ' of modern science, and in the name of a trust which was in- 
tended by its founder to promote “the unfettered exercise of private 
judgement in matters of religion" ’ Another paper said. ‘The 
Chapter House was thickly crowded with perhaps the most re- 
markably eclectic audience ever assembled withm that majestic old 
building To very many the thought must have occurred, with what 
astonishment the old monks of Westminster would have looked 
upon such an audience gathered in their Chapter House for such a 
purpose 5 

The tone of these notices, shows that in religion, as with lan- 
guage, Max Muller could suddenly open up for his hearers wide 
and unsuspected mental horizons Naturally, there were adverse as 
well as appreciative comments, and some in strong and unsparingly 
severe language Max Muller was prepared for the attacks Thus on

December 7, 1878, he wrote to Stanley 'Of course I know that 
many people will be angry with my Lectures If it were not so, I 
should not have written them The more I see of the so-called 
heathen religions, the more I feel convinced that they contain 
germs of the highest truth There is no distinction in kind between 
them and our own religion The artificial distinction which we 
have made has not only degraded the old revelation, but has given 
to our own almost a spectral character ’ 

A few months later he repeated this at greater length to Malabari 
'As I told you on a former occasion,’ he wrote on January 29, 1882, 
'my thoughts were with the people of India I wanted to tell those 
few at least whom I might hope to reach in English, what the true 
historical value of their ancient religion is, as looked upon, not from 
an exclusively European or Christian, but from an historical point 
of view ’ 

At the same time he was aware of a certain risk of being the 
bearer of a misunderstood message to the Hindus of his age As he 
wrote 

I wished to warn against two dangers, that of undervaluing or despising 
the ancient national religion, as is done so often by your half-Euro- 
peamzed youths, and that of overvaluing it, and interpreting it as it was 
never meant to be interpreted, of which you may see a painful instance 
m Dayananda Saraswati’s labours on the Veda Accept the Vedas as an 
ancient historical document, containing thoughts in accordance with 
the character of an ancient and simple-minded race of men, and you 
will be able to admire it, and to retain some of it, particularly the teach- 
ing of the Upamshads , even in these modem days Accept the past as a 
reality, study it and try to understand it, and you will then have less 
difficulty in finding the right way towards the future 

To put it crudely, but not untruly in its essential purport, the 
path taken by the Hindus, with the help of the work on their religion 
by Western scholars and more especially by Max Muller, gradually 
revealed itself to be the very opposite of the right way as understood 
by him 

Already before his death modern Hindus were falling into four 
different groups in their application of the results of Western 
investigations into their past religion The first group was made up 
of the traditional Hindus who were acquiring dogmatism with a 
strong infusion of intolerant fanaticisms in their beliefs and atti- 



VANAPRASTHA 


359 


tudes The second group had in it men of genuine religious sensi- 
bility who had been awakened to a new conception of God and 
spirituality by Christianity, but who tried to clothe their basically 
Christian spiritual life under the cover of Upcmishadic teaching 
There was a third group formed by men who were religious in their 
way, but unable to stand on their own feet So they were carried 
away both by their own inclinations and by the prestige of Europe 
m that age to accept their religion from the hands of European 
charlatans, and to drift towards extremely spurious groups like the 
Theosophists Lastly, the half-Europeamzed part of the Hindu 
intelligentsia made use of the West’s discovery of their religion to 
bolster up a peculiarly xenophobic nationalism, without any realiza- 
tion of its spiritual value 

However, for the present his Hibbert Lectures were translated and 
published in some Indian languages at the initiative of Malabari, 
and as he could not bear the expenses of getting this done himself 
he had to appeal for subscriptions 

Max Muller’s next full-length presentation of his own thoughts 
was an attempt to understand the process of thought itself, which 
resulted in a large book entitled The Science of Thought published in 
March 1887 He was fully conscious of what he was doing, and did 
not expect the same kind of reaction to it as he had seen to his books 
on religion or language Even before the publication of the book he 
wrote to his friend Dr Prowe ‘It contains much that is old, and 
much that is new; but whether the present-day people will read it 
or not, I do not know ’ So far as the book was a reassertion of his 
thesis of the inseparability of thought and language which he had 
put forward in all his treatment of language, it did draw on itself 
adverse comments For the rest, it caused less trouble for him than 
his previous books, and the subsequent ones 

T feel convinced,’ he said, 'that the views put forward in this 
book, which are the result of a long life devoted to solitary reflection 
and to the study of the foremost thinkers of all nations, contain cer- 
tain truths which deserve to be recorded I have written some of 
my books as a pleader, and, if I may judge by results, I have not 
pleaded quite in vam But the present book is not meant to be per- 
suasive All I can say of it is, Dixi et salvavi animam meant 9 

Since the reading public always give every system of thought a 
hallmark and label, he thought it necessary to explain that his 
system might be called Nominalism, which it would not be in any

strict sense It might also be regarded as being materialistic And 
he might be asked whether he was a Darwinian One special con- 
cept of thought, as arrived at by him, he thought it necessary to 
make explicit He said that 'thought in the sense in which I have 
defined it and used it in my book, represents one side of human 
nature only, the intellectual, and there are two other sides, the 
ethical and aesthetical, on which I have not touched' 

After finishing his book on thought he wrote to Noire ‘There is 
a book on mythology to follow, and perhaps the preparation of a 
new edition of Lectures on the Science of Language , and then I may 
be allowed to say, “Now lettest Thou Thy servant depart in peace" ' 
But his nunc dimittis had to be postponed by a chance circumstance 
which led him for four years to devote himself to a consideration of 
the history of religion in the most lengthy and elaborate set of books 
he ever wrote 

In January 1888, his friends had urged on the University of 
Edinburgh the election of Max Muller as the first Gifford Lecturer 
But an old Edinburgh man, Hutchinson Stirling, was elected The 
University of Glasgow, which had also been endowed by Lord 
Gifford, immediately offered its Lectureship to Muller at the in- 
stance of Principal Caird He accepted the invitation 

Lord Gifford had been a distinguished Scottish lawyer, whom the 
outside world took to be no more than a keen, hard-working, and 
judicious professional man, who after gaming wealth, and a good 
deal of it at the Bar, had taken a place on the bench His intimate 
friends knew him as a man of philosophical temperament, who was 
devoted to Plato, Spinoza and other philosophers But his will 
when opened, surprised even them After providing for his rela- 
tives, he gave the residue, a very large sum, to the four Scottish 
universities of Edinburgh, Glasgow, Aberdeen and St Andrews, to 
establish Lectureships on religion He wanted through these lec- 
tures to promote what he called Natural Theology among the people 
of Scotland, and he defined Natural Theology in the widest sense 
of that term as ‘the knowledge of God, the Infinite, the All, the 
First and only Cause, the One and the Sole Substance, the Sole 
Being, the Sole Reality, and the Sole Existence, the Knowledge of 
His Nature and Attributes, the Knowledge of the Relations which 
men and the whole universe bear to Him, the Knowledge of the 
Nature and Foundation of Ethics and Morals, and of all Obligations 
and Duties hence arising'.

To give away one’s money for such a purpose was indeed remark- 
able, but even more remarkable were the terms which were to be 
complied with in electing the lecturers The will declared 

The lecturers shall be subject to no test of any kind, and shall not be 
required to take any oath, or to emit or subscribe any declaration of 
belief, or to make any promise of any land, they may be of any deno- 
mination whatever, or of no denomination at all (and many earnest and 
high-minded men prefer to belong to no ecclesiastical denomination) , 
they may be of any religion or way of thinking, or, as is sometimes said, 
they may be of no religion, or they may be so-called sceptics or agnos- 
tics or free-thinkers, provided that the ‘Patrons’ will use diligence to 
secure that they be able, reverent men, true thinkers, sincere lovers and 
earnest inquirers after truth 

With equal boldness Lord Gifford laid down the principle of 
treating the subjects He wrote ‘I wish the lecturers to treat their 
subject as a strictly natural science, the greatest of all possible 
sciences, indeed, in one sense, the only science, that of Infinite 
Being, without reference to or reliance upon any supposed and so- 
called miraculous revelation I wish it to be considered just as 
astronomy or chemistry is ’ 

In view of these directions in the will of Lord Gifford, Max 
Muller called the Lectureships a sign, and a very important sign, of 
the times 

The first series of Gifford Lectures at Glasgow was delivered by 
Muller in 1888, and he was elected three times after that and de- 
livered the Lectures in 1890, 1891 and 1892 In these four sequences 
he presented a stupendous synthesis of the evolution of religion in 
an ascending process in four stages, which he called Natural 
Religion, Physical Religion, Anthropological Religion and Theo- 
sophy or Psychological Religion 

He tried to observe Lord Gifford’s directions, but was attacked 
for that very reason No public protest was raised against the first 
lectures, though when they were published one critic said that ‘the 
learned professor found something good in every religion, except 
in Christianity’ 

A more comminatory attack was made on Max Muller from the 
Roman Catholic side Monsignor Munro in the Catholic St An- 
drew’s Cathedral took his text from Matthew’s account of the 
betrayal of Christ by Judas, and announced that he was going to

apply that terrible narrative to the subject he was going to deal 
with that evening Then he said 

The Gifford Lectures delivered by Professor Max Muller were nothing 
less than a crusade against Divine revelation, against Jesus Christ, and 
against Christianity The guilt of those who permitted that anti- 
Chnstian doctrme in a university founded to defend Christianity, was 
simply horrible It was a strange thing that in a Christian university, 
public feeling should have tolerated the ostentatious publication of 
infidelity 

As to Max Muller ‘Professor Max Muller was incapable of a philo- 
sophical idea, and ignorant of Christianity he sought to overthrow 
His theory uprooted our idea of God, for it repudiated the idea of a 
personal God ’ 

He added that the lectures were blasphemous, and even Muller’s 
pantheism was atheism in disguise 

However, that made no difference either to Max Muller or to the 
university, and he was able to give his fourth series of lectures in 
1892 The last words of the last series were 

I do not believe in human infallibility, least of all, in Papal infalli- 
bility I do not believe in professorial infallibility, least of all in that of 
your Gifford Lecturer We are all fallible, and we are fallible either in 
our facts, or in the deductions which we draw from them If therefore 
any of my learned critics will tell me which of my facts are wrong, or 
which of my conclusions are faulty, let me assure them, that though I 
am now a very old Professor, I shall always count those among my best 
friends who will not mind the trouble of supplying me with new facts, 
or of pointing out where they have been wrongly stated by me, or who 
will correct any arguments that may seem to them to offend against the 
sacred laws of logic 

It remains to consider only his last major work, his lengthy 
treatise on mythology published in 1897, when he was seventy-four. 
For Max Muller mythology, language and religion were cognate 
subjects In fact, his excursion into mythology was an extension of 
his work on language, and that fact conditioned his whole approach 
to mythology and his method of dealing with it Actually, his essay 
on comparative mythology preceded his formal lectures on lan- 
guage It was published in 1856, five years before them But not less 
important were his conclusions about mythology, incidentally but 



VANAPRASTHA 


363 


quite formally set down in all his books on language and religion 
It was these which really drew the fire of a different school of 
mythologists on him So one might say that his formal book on 
mythology, published when he was almost approaching death, was 
like the legitimization of a dearly loved natural son 

In this chapter I shall give only the external framework of his 
work on mythology Max Muller was extremely tenacious about his 
conclusions on any subject after he had arrived at them as a result 
of prolonged study and thinking That might be looked upon as 
dogmatism, but as has been shown by his final remarks in his last 
Gifford Lecture, he did not admit he was dogmatic He sincerely 
believed that he kept an open mind He always believed and said 
that the claim to have uttered the dernier mot was wholly baseless 
In any case, his treatise on mythology began with a fanfare, and it 
is heartening to feel the gusto of the counter-attack delivered by 
him He did not fight back with spleen and rancour but with cool- 
ness To begin with, he was very forthright about the nature of the 
attacks on his views , 

It is easy to say such things [he wrote in his preface to the book] in a 
number of daily papers, but they do not become true for all that If, 
as happens sometimes, the same critic is on the staff of many papers, 
and has to supply copy every day, every week, or every month, the 
broken rays of one brilliant star may produce the dazzling impression 
of many independent lights, and there has been of late such a galaxy of 
sparkling articles on Comparative Mythology and Folklore, that even 
those who are themselves opposed to this new science, have at last 
expressed their disapproval of the ‘journalistic mist’ that has been 
raised, and that threatens to obscure the real problems of the Science 
of Mythology 

He conceded readily that the writers of such articles were fully 
persuaded of the truth of their opinions, but at the same suggested 
gently that they might also consider the judgement of real scholars 
not wholly undeserving of their attention 

Then he set forth his position in the controversy 

In what I am going to say I am not defending myself, though I am 
always represented, if not as the true founder, at all events as the only 
champion left to defend the Science of Mythology I can therefore 
speak with all the more freedom and without fear of being considered 
egotistical I am pleading pro domo, but not for myself Scholars come

and go and are forgotten, but the road which they have opened 
remains, other scholars follow in their footsteps, and though some of 
them retrace their steps, on the whole there is progress 

After that he went on to mention the names of many eminent 
scholars in Italy, Holland, Germany, America and France to show 
how the science was being carried on 

The whole dispute was over method Max Muller followed the 
philological method, whereas his critics followed the anthropologi- 
cal Max Muller’s contention throughout was that whatever detritus 
mythology may carry along with it, its original constituent elements 
were words and phrases about the most striking phenomena of 
nature, such as day and night, dawn and evening, sun and moon, 
sky, earth and sea, in their various relations to each other and to 
man As his wife defined it in her biography ‘Max Muller’s highest 
object was to discover reason in all the unreason of mythology, and 
thus to vindicate the character of our ancestors, however distant ’ 
As far back as 1869 in a letter to Sir George Cox, another mytho- 
logist, he had emphasized the connexion between Sanskrit, Com- 
parative Philology and Comparative Mythology He wrote ‘The 
most minute criticism of etymological coincidences seems to me 
the only safe foundation of Comparative Mythology . If, there- 
fore, you ask me, I tell you openly, do not make Comparative 
Mythology the principal work of your life, unless you make up your 
mmd first to study Sanskrit and Comparative Philology ’ 

He said the same thing to Andrew Lang, the most sparkling 
among his critics, in a letter written in 1897 ‘Still less could I 
understand why you should have attacked me, or rather my masters, 
without learning Sanskrit, which is by no means so difficult as 
people imagine You must have a rapier to fight a man who has a 
rapier, otherwise it becomes a row * 

He asserted at the same time that he did not dispute the value of 
the anthropological approach, and observed ‘I don’t say that I 
should go to the stake for it, but I am perfectly certain that some 
good may be got from the study of savages for the elucidation of 
Aryan myths Uun n’empeche pas V autre 5 

Continuing, he paid a warm tribute to Frazer of The Golden 
Bough ‘Frazer has never attacked me, and I have always touched 
my hat to him He works his mine, I work mine why should we 
quarrel

Andrew Lang had the good sense and the good manners to 
recognize the urbanity of Max Muller in controversy, and also to 
perceive the basic cause of their differences After the death of 
Muller he wrote to Mrs Max Muller 'My own relations with Mr 
Max Muller were those of an amateur, or casual inquirer, who ven- 
tured, on a single point, to oppose the conclusions of a man emi- 
nently learned We approached the subject, that of the origin of 
myths, from different quarters, and saw different sides of the shield 
as in the old apologue Neither of us was fortunate enough to con- 
vert the other ’ Then followed his tribute 

But what I am anxious to say is, that Mr Max Muller always met my 
criticisms, often petulant in manner, and perhaps often unjust, with a 
good humour and kindness perhaps unexampled in the controversies 
of the learned and the half-learned I shall always remember with 
pleasure certain occasions when Mr Max Muller turned my own laugh 
against myself, with victorious humour and good humour History 
would offer reading much more agreeable, if discussions were always 
conducted (they almost never are) in the genial and humane temper 
which Mr Max Muller displayed in dealing with an 'opposite* so un- 
worthy as myself 

Such letters keep up one’s faith in and respect for writers and 
scholars 

Though Max Muller was always ready to go on with his work 
without the world’s praise, it could never be said that those who 
conferred position in the world were indifferent to his merits From 
a fairly early age he had been receiving academic and other honours 
which would have satisfied the yearning for recognition of any 
scholar Though he had never sought or canvassed for them, he 
was not above feeling a certain pride in them Actually he delighted 
m them from a childlike desire for praise, regarded them as a 
precious reward, and above all as a strong incentive to further work 
However, one grievance lingered vaguely in his heart and 
rankled more actively in the mind of his wife, who could not under- 
stand why when foreign countries were vying with one another to 
grant him distinctions, nothing had been given him in his adopted 
country She smarted under this sense of injustice The death of 
his first daughter made him somewhat indifferent to such things, 
and he wrote to his wife in 1883 'There was a time when I should 
have liked to have been made Sir Frederick and you Lady Max

Muller Dear Stanley wrote to me years ago that a baronetcy or a 
life peerage would be the right thing — however, we do very well 
without, and want nothing more from the world ’ 

In one very high place in the world there was great regard both 
for him and his work The Queen herself and the entire royal 
household were always very kind to him So in 1886 the Queen 
suggested to Gladstone that he might receive some public mark of 
her favour The Prime Minister suggested a knighthood Upon this 
the Queen wanted to know privately what Max Muller’s feeling 
might be Neither Max Muller nor his wife could look upon this 
as an adequate recognition when foreign countries had given him 
their highest honours reserved for literary work So the objection 
was explained to the Queen, and she fully appreciated Muller’s 
motives in not accepting a knighthood 

Ten years later it was obviously the Queen again who took the 
initiative On May 17, 1896, Lord Salisbury as Prime Minister 
wrote in his own hand to Max Muller 

Dear Professor Max Muller, 

I have great pleasure in informing you that Her Majesty has been 
pleased to mark her sense of the great services you have rendered to 
philological science in this country and of your singular eminence in 
the world of letters, by directing that you should be summoned to the 
Privy Council I am very glad to be the channel of this communication 

Believe me, 

Yours very truly, 

Salisbury 

The announcement was made among the Birthday Honours on 
May 20 The Times commented that it was £ a fitting recognition of 
distinguished services to literature and philology extending over 
the half-century he has lived amongst us ’ It is not clear whether on 
May 20 Max Muller had as yet received Salisbury’s letter and was 
keeping the matter confidential even from his wife In any case, he 
came down to the drawing-room that morning with The Times in 
hand, and said to his wife ‘Don’t faint’, and handed her the paper 
The announcement was in three places on the editorial page There 
was great joy for both, because it was felt that the recognition was 
exceptional Max Muller knew that he was going to be the only non- 
political Privy Councillor, and that might cause jealousy among 
scientific workers But congratulations poured in all day long.

Max Muller was duly grateful He wrote to Sir Robert Collins, 
Secretary to the Duchess of Albany £ I am really quite upset I had 
so little expected anything of the kind, and it is, of course, far too 
much However, it shows the Queen’s very kind heart I confess 
there always was something bitter when I received so many favours 
from other countries, and nothing from the country of my choice 
and love One enemy can do more harm than many friends can 
mend ’ What he felt no less strongly was the death of those friends 
who would have rejoiced most at the event 

His only surviving daughter Beatrice was greatly pleased, but she 
was not forgetful of her mother and brother So she wrote ‘Dear 
Daddy P C , I suppose now they will soon make you a baronet 
which would be nice for Billy and Mama, I am so sorry this gives 
her nothing 

Though Max Muller’s life was despaired of during his serious 
illness in the autumn of 1899, was sufficiently recovered in the 
next spring to give his friends and family an impression of renewed 
vitality It was during this intermezzo of energy that he carried on 
his vigorous polemics with Mommsen over the Boer War He was 
also receiving many visitors A professor from Vienna, after visiting 
him at his home, wrote about him in a German paper ‘He keeps 
his Oxford home hospitably open for foreign birds of passage, who 
find their way to Oxford from all corners of the universe,’ Among 
the visitors at this time were a number of Indian princes, including 
the Gaekwar of Baroda 

At this time he was also interviewed by the representative of a 
magazine (Hugh W Strong, for the Temple Magazine ), and the 
account was published in June 1900 Speaking to this interviewer 
m answer to his questions, Max Muller gave what might be called 
a valedictory message. I shall quote a few of the questions and 
answers 

Q ‘Your seventy-seventh year, Professor?’ 

A ‘Yes, and I never felt old until this illness ’ 

Q ’From which you are making an excellent recovery May I be per- 
mitted to ask, what are your literary plans for the future?’ 

A ‘My work is done All I can do in the future is to look on There is 
the Rig- Veda in six large volumes, and The Sacred Books of the East 
m fifty volumes of translations, my commission from the Oxford 
University These really form my life’s work Beyond them are 
numerous other books and translations, my History of Sanskrit

Mythology , History of Indian Philosophy , etc , while most of my 
shorter writings are collected in Chips from a German Workshop 
Now I feel it is high time I drew in my sails — which hitherto have 
been for ever spread to the favouring gale ’ 

Q ‘May we next discuss your methods of work?* 

A ‘They are very simple When I have nothing to do I work * 

Q ‘But your recreations, Professor ^ 

A ‘Oh* I didn’t want them As soon as I felt exhausted I gave up and 
rested Absence of occupation is not rest 9 
Q ‘And now may I ask what progress y our special studies are making ? t 
A ‘Most satisfactory on the whole The three mam branches especi- 
ally well the Science of Language here in Oxford , the Science of 
Comparative Mythology in Germany, and the Science of Com- 
parative Religions in England The latter is, of course, a subject 
which naturally appeals to English thought and interest 5 
Q ‘A last word as to Oxford, Professor 

A ‘Oxford the unchangeable 5 Why, it has simply been revolutionized 
m appearance and character since I first saw it Fancy, there were 
no married dons in those days * And now* [He did not tell the inter- 
viewer that he was the first married Fellow ] The Vice-Chancellor 
and heads of houses were little kings If you happened to catch 
them in good humour at dinner, they would mention your wish at 
the Hebdomadal Council We have changed all that ’ 

In the next summer his health declined, and it was soon apparent 
that he was going At this time a visitor came to his house by a very 
curious chance, but the visit was symbolic of his life and of its main 
interest, for the visitor was an Indian Holy Man. 

On August 7, 1900, quite early in the morning Mrs Max Muller 
was told that two Hindus were at the door, and going down she 
found two strange figures, one dressed in a flowing robe, with his 
bare feet in slippers, and a turban on his head The other was a 
much younger man, and could speak a little English He explained 
that his companion was a most holy Yogin, by name Agamya 
Yogmdra, who had arrived in England from India a few days ago, 
and had now hastened to Oxford to meet the only man in England 
whose name they knew. They were told that Max Muller could not 
come down before 1 1 o’clock, and so they went away to come back 
at the time given 

From information received later from India, Max Muller came 
to know that he was a genuine Mahatma, who, as a holy man, had a

very high position in India, and had mastered all that was to be 
gained by the ascetic discipline of Hinduism He had braved the 
voyage to England impelled by the pure desire to impart what he 
believed to be the highest knowledge, and in his innocence had 
thought that his name and fame would be so known in England 
that admiring crowds would meet him in London But at the station 
he found nobody and was sitting bewildered, when a porter saw the 
Yogm and his chela (disciple) amid the bundles which contained 
their food and cooking pots, formed an idea according to his know- 
ledge what sort of persons they might be, and sent them to the 
Psychic Society, whose members passed them on to Oxford 

When he met Muller, Dr Carpenter and Mr Bidder, the Vicar of 
St Giles, were present Protap Chunder Mozoomdar, the Brahmo 
leader who was also in England then, arrived soon after as he was 
invited to spend the day with the Mullers Mozoomdar was in total 
disgrace with the Yogm, for he had been summoned to the presence 
in London, but had been unable to go on account of a previous 
speaking engagement Yogm could not understand how a mere en- 
gagement could interfere with his command, and treated Mozoom- 
dar with great severity It amused Mrs Max Muller to observe that 
Mozoomdar seemed to accept his position without reserve and 
acknowledge the crime which he had unwittingly committed She 
did not, of course, know that these Hindu holy men were the equiva- 
lents of kings in another dimension of the world, and were absolute 
monarchs by Divine right in that dimension That was why they 
were always addressed as Maharaj, great king, by all 

Anyhow the interview proceeded Max Muller spoke in Sanskrit 
unfamiliarly pronounced for the Yogm, and the Yogm spoke Eng- 
lish in an imperfect manner and Sanskrit with a pronunciation 
Muller could not understand The others observed the powerful 
personality of the teacher He was a tall, strongly built man, with a 
face of unusual breadth with sunken eyes, a wide, but firmly closed 
mouth, a resolute chin, all of which spoke of long practices of medi- 
tation and self-control 

After talking for some time with Muller, he turned to Mr Bidder 
to denounce the country to which he had come ‘I had come to teach 
men the subtle enigmas of existence, but England was like a poison- 
ous fruit, fair and attractive to view, but full of deadly juice; there 
were no good men, no one who wanted to understand knowledge, 
only in this house have I found a good man and one who knows 9

It was found that Max Muller was tired out by this difficult con- 
versation, and wanted a little rest before lunch But when he sat at 
lunch he talked with animation The Yogm would not sit down to 
eat with them, but remained in the library But they all met again 
at the coffee-table on the garden terrace Dr Carpenter did not want 
to overstrain Max Muller, and went away with the Yogm, who in 
October was sent back to India 

While sitting with Max Muller, Dr Carpenter observed that the 
Yogm was looking fixedly at his host, 'almost as one who could 
read the lines of destiny’ Max Muller observed 'My life is nearly 
over, I shall never be able to do any more work 5 The Yogm went 
up to him, placed a hand on either shoulder, looked long and fixedly 
into Muller’s face, and replied 'Yes, I see death has come near you, 
friend He has looked you in the face ’ 

Mr Bidder recalled this parting in these words T shall never for- 
get the scene on the garden terrace, when this representative of 
ancient India took a last farewell of India’s friend and champion ’ 
On October 28, 1900, Max Muller died, and in his condolence 
letter Anagarika Dharmapala, the Ceylonese Buddhist monk who 
lived in Calcutta, wrote to Mrs Max Muller T now offer the 
deepest sympathy of all Buddhists in your bereavement, and I 
repeat the noble words of our Lord Buddha, which he uttered 2,489 
years ago, "Do not grieve at my passing away, since it is natural 
to die” ’ 



Conclusion 


THE MAN AND THE THINKER 

How much of a man’s inner life can remain wholly unperceived 
even when sufficient information about it has been provided from 
letters and other intimate papers can be judged from a remark made 
m a review of Mrs Max Muller’s biography of her husband, pub- 
lished in 1902 The reviewer said 

There are no subtle recesses of psychology to be explored in this 
eminently sane, open, unembarrassed Teutonic nature, certain of him- 
self, his work and the world Such a nature makes for the happiness of 
its owner, but there is nothing salient or picturesque which the reader’s 
interest can lay hold of 

Though the remark was not made in malice, anything more wide 
of the mark about Max Muller could not be imagined, because there 
was enough material in the two volumes of the biography to show, 
despite a wife’s natural reticence in the presentation of her husband, 
how complex his personality was 

There was greater scope for imperfect understanding during his 
lifetime, for as seen from the outside his was a career of uninter- 
rupted successes and growing fame. If he had died before Dr 
Samuel Smiles published his Self-help his example would certainly 
have been included in the book Success through self-help and per- 
severance was the most obvious feature of Muller’s life So, review- 
ing the biography, the Daily Telegraph's critic wrote with greater 
appreciation than the other reviewer just quoted 'His career 
possesses the dramatic interest of a hard-fought battle, its vicis- 
situdes, its momentary despondency, its rekindled enthusiasm, its 
final and decisive victory.’ 

But the account I have given would also show that besides this — 
an unquestionable achievement because Muller obtained his worldly 
success by obstinately pursuing the most unworldly and even un- 
practical ideal — there were other remarkable things in him A man’s 
life is led at different levels In a notice of the life of Baron Bunsen, 
his friend and patron, Max Muller himself wrote 'All really great 
and honest men may be said to live three lives, there is one life 



372 SCHOLAR EXTRAORDINARY 

which is seen and accepted by the world at large, a man’s outward 
life , there is the second life which is seen by a man’s most intimate 
friends, his household life, and there is a third life, seen only by 
the man himself and by Him who searcheth the heart, which may 
be called the inner or heavenly life ’ 

Quoting this passage the distinguished Dutch Arabic scholar, de 
Goeje, who succeeded to his place in the Institut as Associate 
Member, said in his eloge that he could speak only about the first 
aspect of Muller’s life, and he paid him a most handsome tribute 
It would, however, be wrong to think that the most conspicuous 
merit would be recognized as such by everybody During his life 
Max Muller had his share of belittling After his death stones were 
printed about him which for fear of a contradiction or an action of 
libel would never have been published before Even very respectable 
papers carried these tales He has also been disparaged in autobio- 
graphical books published in our times when nobody remembers 
him It was not on the supposed inadequacies of Max Muller’s 
scholarship that the more piquant dismissal of him was based It 
was on the attribution to him of ridiculous weaknesses like personal 
vanity. For example, de Goeje in his eloge said 

One of my colleagues at Leyden one day saw me surrounded by Max 
Muller’s books and expressed his surprise When I informed him that 
I was preparing myself to write a notice of his life and work he ex- 
claimed ‘Ah* I do not like your Max Muller He was a vam man who 
was only after his own glory ’ I protested against this judgement, 
which I have heard pronounced by others 

De Goeje added. 

It needs the sacred fire to sustain a man in such stupendous activity, 
only a sincere scientific conviction can create such eloquence Pectus 
est quod dzsertum facit [It is the heart which makes eloquence ] 

All this attribution of vanity, especially in respect to clothes, was 
known to Mrs Max Muller, and about it she wrote in her biography 
‘Some of his critics, who never knew him personally, speak of his 
vanity, because he dwelt with pleasure and gratitude on the honours 
and successes that came to him in later life Any really vam man 
would have shrunk from showing his enjoyment of the good things 
that fell to him, for fear of being thought vam ’ She explained that 
to the end of his life Muller showed ‘the child’s pure delight in little

things, that gave a constant zest to his life, and he had the power of 
rejoicing in every little luxury and pleasure which he could afford 
himself 5 The poverty in which his boyhood and youth was passed 
made him all the more disposed to do so In his school days when 
he came home in the vacations he did not wear his expensive school 
boots, but to save them put on the home-made shoes provided for 
him by his mother 

The real test of a man’s character is his uncensored private 
correspondence and diaries, and I have read a good deal of both 
from Muller I have not found one passage which shows him different 
from what he appeared to be in the public eye His was too trans- 
parent a nature for any kind of disguise But I have also found that 
he was not ignorant of the ways of the world, nor disposed to be its 
victim He had acquired much worldly experience in the course of 
his early struggles, and in later life he was as much a man of the 
world as he was a studious recluse Besides, a man of his keen mental 
powers was not likely to prevent these powers from playing on the 
life that he saw around himself He gave the benefit of that ex- 
perience to his son, though he did not always employ it for his own 
advancement 

Many examples of worldly wisdom are found scattered liberally 
in Max Muller’s correspondence with his son, and they would 
qualify him as another Polomus or a Victorian Chesterfield. If he 
wanted to satisfy his penchant for generalization from his experience 
of the world he could easily have become a writer of maxims like 
La Rochefoucauld, Vauvenargues, or Chamfort, because there was 
a vein of sententiousness in him But his interest was elsewhere, 
and his sententiousness was exhibited differently 

Max Muller took life and the world too seriously to be capable 
of becoming worldly He was very much like the other Anglo- 
German he so much admired, that is, Prince Albert And he would 
always repeat to himself, as to his son , — Das Leben ist ernst That 
made him disinclined even to make life an art As he wrote to his 
son 6 Das Leben ist erne Kunst , is Goethe’s doctrine, and there is 
some truth in it also, as long as Kunst implies nothing artful or arti- 
ficial ’ His moral preoccupation was always dominant in his response 
to the visual arts, though not to music, which being abstract and 
absolute was tied up with his religious sentiment So, in painting he 
felt drawn towards works in which he could see a clear moral con- 
tent, and this drew him strongly towards the picture of La Canta by

Andrea del Sarto, whose face he assumed to be that of Andrea’s 
wife Lucrezia In Florence, as he was passing along a narrow street 
after seeing the frescoes of Andrea in the Collegio dello Scalzo, he 
suddenly saw against a wall in one of the shops the face of la Canta 
with the ram streaming on it — 'silver grey, placid and perfect And 
there was the boy holding her hand, and the other boy on her arm, 
and the third boy hiding behind her dress 5 He bought it for a 
nothing He thought it might be a contemporary replica, though it 
was later ascertained to be a nineteenth-century copy 

He wrote an essay on the picture, sent copies to his friends 
Browning and Ruskm, and asked their opinion The writer of 'An- 
drea del Sarto, the Perfect Painter’ wrote to him appreciatively, but 
Ruskm almost snarled out 'Andrea and his story are alike out of 
my range of work or care You never find him named by me, during 
the whole course of my Oxford lectures — nor do I recognize any 
worth in him but that of a dexterous schoolman I liked your paper 
extremely — but it seemed to me late in the life of a man of your 
power to be either first discovering or first asking in what Beauty 
consists 5 Perhaps in this particular area of Muller’s sensitiveness 
Ruskm was not far wrong 

Religion, morality, and thought where his three preoccupations 
A disciple of Kant was not likely to be anything but firm in his 
morality, and so firm that he saw no necessity for revalidating his 
trust in it by means of criticism, whose application he considered 
indispensable in the case of religion His respect for morality also 
made him almost a worshipper of Buddha, more a moral than a 
religious prophet But, as between religion and intellection, he was 
throughout given to that 'dialogue’ or dialectic he so much valued 
as a method The man of faith in him was unceasingly holding an 
argument with the man of reason He was as cerebral as he was 
religious, and though he never perceived it, this perpetuated an un- 
resolved dichotomy in him 

As has been noted before, at the end of his life Max Muller set 
down that he was never troubled by the religious doubts which 
assailed his distinguished contemporaries, and that he was carried 
along by the simple Protestant faith which was instilled into him at 
Dessau by his mother But there was enough evidence in all his 
writings to show that this was not the whole story for him His 
works on religion, which constitute the most voluminous part of 
his immense literary output, was as much communing with himself 



CONCLUSION 375 

as communication to others He often dwelt on the nature of a 
child’s faith 

‘There is certainly no happier life/ he once wrote, ‘than a life of 
simple faith , of literal acceptance, of rosy dreams . But can we 
prevent the light of the sun and noises of the street from waking the 
happy child from his heavenly dreams ? Nay, is it not our duty to 
wake the child 

Again, ‘There is a difference between the childlike faith of a 
man (all real faith must be childlike) and the childlike faith of a 
child The one is Paradise not yet lost, the other Paradise lost but 
regained The one is right for the child, the other is right for the 
man ’ (See also pp 277-78 ) 

Yet again, ‘Who, if he is honest towards himself, could say that 
the religion of his manhood was the same as that of his childhood, 
or the religion of his old age the same as the religion of his man- 
hood ? It is easy to deceive ourselves, and to say that the most per- 
fect faith is a childlike faith Nothing can be truer, and the older we 
grow the more we learn to understand the wisdom of the childlike 
faith But before we can learn that, we have first to learn another 
lesson, namely, to put away childish things ’ 

There it was — the entire motivation of his stupendous inquiry 
into religion, with its philosophical, scientific, and historical facets 
But the question arises Where did all this land him ? Did it lead 
him back to the Paradise of the child Max Muller’s faith, to an 
acceptance of Christianity ? Some of the basic conclusions about 
religion to which he arrived would have startled him if he had in 
him any attachment to the kind of Christian orthodoxy asserted by 
every Church or denomination of Christianity Here, in his own 
words, are a few of them 

1 The more we study the history of the religions of the world, the 
clearer it becomes that there is really no religion which could be called 
an individual religion, in the sense of a religion created, as it were de 
novo, or lather ab ovo, by one single person This may seem strange, 
and yet it is really most natural Religion, like language, is everywhere 
an historical growth, and to invent a completely new religion would be 
as hopeless a task as to invent a completely new language 

2 From a comparative study of religion we shall learn that there 
hardly is one religion which does not contain some truth, some im- 
portant truth , truth sufficient to enable those who seek the Lord, and 
feel after Him, to find Him in their hour of need

3 A belief in God, in the immortality of the soul, and in a future 
retribution, can be gained, and not only can be but has been gained, 
b} the right exercise of human reason alone, without the assistance of 
xv hat has been called a special revelation 

4 If there is one thing which a comparative study of religions places 
m the clearest light, it is the inevitable decay to which ex cry leligion 
is exposed 

5 Of Max Muller’s many pronouncements on Christ I shall cite only 
two He said that those who depnxed Jesus of His real humanity in 
order to exalt Him above all humanity were really undoing His w orh 
Christ came to teach us, not what He was, but what we are He had seen 
that man, unless he learned himself to be the child of God, was lost 
Max Muller could see that this would raise a question for the Christian 
Is not Christ God ? He answered Yes, He is, but in His own sense, not 
in the Jewish nor in the Greek sense, nor in the sense which so many 
Christians attach to that article of their faith Christ’s teaching is that 
we are of God, that there is in us something divine, that we are nothing 
if we are not that 

6 Last of all Max Muller believed that the study of all the religions ot 
the world, however high or low, however primitive or developed, 
would enable Christians to appreciate better than ever what they had in 
their own religion and declared that no one who had not examined 
patiently and honestly the other religions of the world could know 
what Christianity really was, or could join with such truth and sin- 
cerity in the words of St Paul, ‘I am not ashamed of the gospel of 
Christ * 

It is hardly to be wondered that in the light of such opinions 
incessantly repeated by Max Muller, orthodox Christians would 
consider him both un- Christian and anti-Christian, for certainly 
these views disregarded, if they did not reject, the whole central 
kerygma of Christianity as a special dispensation of God for man 
His wide and catholic inquiry mto all religions gave Max Muller a 
profound veneration for all religious inclinations and aspirations, 
and also sympathy and tolerance for them. But it also made him 
blind to the particularity of Christianity as a religion, and this is 
surprising in a man of his historical consciousness Not only to 
Christians but even to non-Christians, if the latter have studied the 
religion at all, Christianity should appear as a unique religious 
phenomenon, different even from the two religions to which it was 
the nearest, namely, Judaism and Islam Christianity does not take 
its stand on a general concept of God's relations with man, but on a

particular act of His for the redemption of man Muller’s concept 
of Christianity as embodied in his writings almost ignored the ideas 
of Incarnation, Mediation, Expiation, and Resurrection It made 
him forget that intolerance of other religions was of the very essence 
of Christianity The Christian was bound to be even more uncom- 
promising in his attitude to unbelievers than the Muslim or the 
Communist To make Christianity tolerant of all religious beliefs is 
to destroy it in its most characteristic aspect 

Why was Max Muller led to this position intellectually and 
ethically, whatever he might have been as a believer ? To begin at 
the very beginning, that was in obedience to the trend which made 
its appearance as soon as Christian preachers thought of taking it 
to the Gentiles They were forced to philosophize in order to 
justify to the Greeks what was foolishness to them That brought 
Christianity to an unquiet marriage with reason, to which no other 
religion had come They kept faith and 1 eason quite apart After that 
came the entire intellectual tradition created by the Graeco-Roman 
elements in European culture, with its philosophical as well as 
scientific sides, which taught that question and analysis are the 
beginning of knowledge 

Relief in examination and revalidation made Max Muller think 
that even atheism made a contribution of great value to religion and 
faith ‘There is an atheism’, he wrote, ‘which is unto death, there is 
another atheism which is the life-blood of all true faith It is the 
power of giving up what, in our best, in our most honest, moments, 
we know to be no longer true , it is the readiness to replace the less 
perfect, however dear, however sacred it may have been to us, by the 
more perfect, however much it may be detested, as yet, by the world 
It is the true self-surrender, the true self-sacrifice, the truest trust 
m truth, the truest faith Without that atheism religion would long 
ago have become a petrified hypocrisy, without that atheism no new 
religion, no reform, no reformation, no resuscitation would ever 
have been possible, without that atheism no new life is possible for 
any one of us ’ 

This is putting faith in reason above faith in dogma or even 
belief From the religious point of view this application of the in- 
tellect is like Abraham’s sacrifice of his son to his Lord But Max 
Muller does not seem to have realized that the sacrifice would have 
run its course except for the intervention of the Lord Any thorough- 
going application of reason to faith can only destroy the latter So

Christian faith, incapable of existing without reason, had to pro- 
pound a new view of reason Le cosm a ses raisons que la raison ne 
connait pas To say Credo ul mtelhgam is typically Christian, to 
reverse the formula and say Intellego nt credam is also partly 
Christian, but only on the assumption that understanding is only 
an instrument of believing Taken without this limitation and 
reservation, the intellect could only destroy religious life Max 
Muller was certainly conscious of that too, for he wrote ‘True 
religion, that is practical, active, living religion, has little or nothing 
to do with logical or metaphysical quibbles Practical religious life, 
is a new life, a life in the sight of God, and it springs from what may 
be called a new birth 9 

Despite this, the duality which divided him between faith and 
reason persisted, and this was due not only to the hold on him of 
the intellectual tradition of the Greeks taken over by the Christian 
apologists, but also to something innate in him, to his temperament, 
which was Apollmian and not Dionysiac This distinction is seen 
not only in the antithesis between the man of action and the man of 
contemplation, but also among the intellectuals themselves Some 
of them can immerse themselves in their experience and project 
their response to it in a manner which in spite of its logical trappings 
is intuitive, and is therefore akm to prophetic utterances These 
are the Dionysiacs of thought, and Hegel, Nietzsche, Marx, or even 
Freud might be classed as such Against them stand the intellectuals 
who want to reduce experience to order, and present even the supra- 
rational as rational, or at any rate in a form which would be acces- 
sible to human intelligence Kant was of that type, the Apollmian 
among thinkers Muller, the disciple of Kant was also bound to 
be such 

So, he was as religious as he was philosophical, and as philoso- 
phical as he was religious He wanted to bring the two as near as 
possible. As he wrote 

Religion is not philosophy, but there never has been a religion, and 
there never can be, which is not based on philosophy, and does not 
presuppose the philosophical notions of the people The highest aim 
towards which all philosophy strives, is and will always remain the 
idea of God, and it was this idea which Christianity grasped in the 
Platonic sense, and presented to us most clearly in its highest form, in 
the Fourth Gospel

This made him put forward his dialectic concept of the evolution 
of religion In the very first senes of lectures on the ‘science of 
religion’ which he delivered in 1870 he said 

From first to last religion is oscillating between two opposite poles, and 
it is only if the attraction of one of the two poles becomes too strong, 
that healthy movement ceases, and stagnation and decay set in If 
religion cannot accommodate itself on the one side to the capacity of 
children, or if on the other side it fails to satisfy the requirements of 
men, it has lost its vitality, and it becomes either mere superstition or 
mere philosophy 

It was natural therefore that he should accept and exalt the idea 
of Logos, both in its Greek and Christian form As embodied in the 
Fourth Gospel, it revealed to him not only the unbreakable bond 
between word and thought, but also their continuation as the Son 
of God and, finally, Jesus 

In this aspect of Muller’s speculations about religion he was a 
participant in religious experience, and, in an age which is irre- 
ligious (not anti-religious) and faithless, not much interest is likely 
to be felt in his views on religion as a phenomenon of human ex- 
perience with an intrinsic value for all men. Nobody can say now 
whether that kind of interest will come back In the meanwhile, 
there is interest in religion as a phenomenon to be observed scienti- 
fically from the outside Max Muller in another aspect of his inquiry 
into religion was, or at least claimed to be, a scientist. In fact, com- 
parative study of ancient religions scientifically was very largely his 
creation, and in spite of the presence in them of philosophical or 
devotional utterances, he called all his books ‘Science of Religion’ 
m its varied aspects 

First of all, according to him, religion, like all other objects of 
scientific inquiry, was based on sense perception As he put it, 
‘religion, if it is to hold its place as a legitimate element of our 
consciousness, must like all other knowledge, begin with experi- 
ence’ Secondly, he thought, religion was based on an innate urge 
m man for the Infinite. So the most general definition he could give 
of religion was this ‘Religion consists in the perception of the 
infinite under such manifestations as are able to influence the moral 
character of man ’ He admitted that this definition of religion 
covered only its origin, but explained that ‘if we once admit a con- 
tinuity in the historical growth of religion, the same definition ought

to remain applicable to all later developments’ In any case, he was 
not readv to surrender the claim science had on religion, and so he 
wrote ‘To those who maintain that religion is chiefly modus cogno- 
scendi Deum, a way of knowing God, we should reply that there is 
no conceptual knowledge which is not based first of all on perceptual 
knowledge ’ 

I shall not discuss here the merits of Max Muller’s scientific 
conclusions about religion, but only describe one of its controversial 
aspects The workers who followed him in the study of comparative 
religion began to poke fun at him, and especially at his solar myth 
The more serious charge was that he was idealizing early religions 
too much for a scientist 

Now, this challenge came mostly from the Christian school at 
first and then from the anthropological school To take the Christian 
view first he said that the ancient non-Christian religions of the 
world, though professed by highly civilized peoples, had been most 
unfairly treated by most historians and theologians Every act of 
the life of their founders which showed that they were but men had 
been eagerly seized and judged without mercy , every doctrine that 
was not carefully guarded had been misinterpreted and distorted, 
every act of worship that differed from the Christian had been held 
up to ridicule Hence, he declared, there had arisen a complete mis- 
apprehension of the real character of ancient religions, and Chris- 
tianity itself had been tom away from its ‘sacred context of the 
history of the world’ 

With the emergence of the anthropological inquiry into religion 
this attack was resumed from another direction the anthropological 
Blucher joined the theological Wellington to bring about a twilight 
of the ancient gods Max Muller had no quarrel with anthropology 
wheie it was applicable But he would not admit that it was applic- 
able to the ancient civilized religions As he had said, Frazer worked 
his mine, and he worked his His method of dealing with the ancient 
religions was philological and historical , he would not admit that 
the notions derived from the observation of the religion of con- 
temporary primitive peoples could be read back into the old 
religions 

As it happens, this quarrel has recently been witnessed apropos 
of a reinterpretation of ancient Roman religion offered by the 
English Latinist, Rose In the light of the description of the religion 
of the Melanesians by Codrmgton he has equated their mana with 



CONCLUSION

the numen of the Romans, and represented Roman religion as 
manaistic in origin, and even character Georges Dumezil, who in 
our time is continuing the historical and philological method of 
Muller in his monumental studies of the religion of the Indo- 
Europeans, has vigorously contested this ‘pnmitivizmg 7 of ancient 
civilized religions, raising the question Numen or god? He ob- 
serves very cogently that £ in all religions, even the highest, one finds 
that in the same epoch and in the same society the faithful who 
practise, so far from placing their practices on the same level, have 
a wide gamut of interpretations ranging from pure automatism to 
the most unfettered mysticism?' He cites the opinion of a fellow- 
worker who has written on Yoga that the manipulations of the holy 
are necessarily ambivalent, at times taking place on the religious 
plane and at others on the magical without any awareness on the 
part of the manipulator as to whether he is performing an act of 
worship or a magical operation Dumezil also points out that the 
linguistic and material resources for embodying the invisible are 
limited, and therefore from the words and the apparatus of a cult 
no one can be sure whether he is seeing devotion or magic This is 
amplifying the argument of Muller against the application of 
anthropological methods to civilized religions William James also 
warned students of religion against taking the origins of a religion 
too literally in assessing it in its full development 

Max Muller would have nothing to do with this ‘dis-idealization 7 
of religion He was also led to idealize the ancient religions on 
account of his respect and love for mankind Some of his sayings 
illustrate this strikingly ‘Human nature is divine nature modified 7 
‘God comes to us in the likeness of man — there is no other God 7 
‘Next to our faith in God there is nothing so essential to the healthy 
growth of our whole being as an unshaken faith in man . 7 So, all his 
interpretations of religion and mythology, based on his love for 
man, can be called his Canticles, for in spite of their scientific and 
philosophical form there is a fervour and vocal exultation in them 
which come only from religion. 

Meanwhile, what had happened to his childlike faith? There is 
no doubt that he cherished it. But there are no records of it in his 
feelings and thoughts set down in late life Even in his most intimate 
confessions there is no trace of his radiant faith. They only show a 
stoical resignation to God's will. Wie Gott will was inscribed on his 
tombstone

SCHOLAR EXTRAORDINARY 


Was it his stupendous intellectual effort to understand man and 
his religion which had brought him to this state ? His personal 
mood was very much like that of the Preacher Tn much knowledge 
is much grief and he that mcreaseth knowledge mcreaseth sorrow 5 
Perhaps, imitating Plato, one might apply a Greek fable to the quest 
for knowledge, especially for scientific knowledge of religion and 
love Blameless Actaeon was torn by dogs for having inadvertently 
caught a glimpse of the bathing Artemis The Artemis of life per- 
haps visits those who pry into her mysteries with the same punish- 
ment Freud and Havelock Ellis, coming after Max Muller, seem 
to indicate that 

In any case, his colossal labour thoroughly tired out Max Muller 
His last words were, T am tired 9 As in a dying man the bodily 
sensation is paramount, these words perhaps should not be taken too 
seriously But they echoed the refrain of his last years — that he was 
very tired In the letter to his son written just over a year before his 
death (quoted on page 252) he said that he wanted rest but added 
that so far as his life was concerned it might be a hopeless fight, it 
could hardly be otherwise. 

The same letter contains what might be called his last testament 
T am prepared to go,’ he wrote, fit would be strange if I were not, 
with such a long life behind me, and most of it devoted to religious 
and philosophical questions And having lived this long life, so full 
of light, having been led so kindly by a fatherly hand through all 
storms and struggles, why should I be afraid when I have to make 
the last step ? I have finished all my work, and what is more I see 
that it will be carried on by others, by stronger and younger men 
I have never piled mud in the market, I gladly left that to others, 
but I have laid a foundation that will last, and though people don’t 
see the blocks buried in a river, it is on these unseen blocks that the 
bridge rests I cannot do any more work 9 

That was as much as any scholar or scientist could say of his 
work Max Muller was a pioneer and explorer, and he will be re- 
membered as such But he was also a man, and in our idea of him as 
such we need not assess the value of his life as only relative
