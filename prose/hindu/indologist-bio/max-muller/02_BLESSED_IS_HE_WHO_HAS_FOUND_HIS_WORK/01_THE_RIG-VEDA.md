THE RIG-VEDA 

It took Max Muller five years of continuous labour, which was 
partly mechanical drudgery, to complete the editing and printing of 
only the first volume of his edition of the Rig-Veda To understand 
the spirit and motivation of this project as well as his interest in the 
wider field of Sanskrit literature as a whole, it is necessary to take 
note of a basic contrast , that which existed between the German and 
English attitudes towards India in his young days This is essential 
because in his own position there was an amalgamation of the two 
He began as a purely German Indophile and Indologist, and soon 
assumed the roles in their Bntish form, without however losing 
his original affiliation and inspiration 

Generally speaking India attracted Continental Europeans, 
especially the Germans, and repelled the British This difference 
persisted even down to the last quarter of the nineteenth century 
For instance, when Sir Henry Maine in 1875 delivered the Rede 
Lecture before the University of Cambridge on ‘The Effects of 
Observation of India on Modern European Thought’, he began by 
remarking that in speaking on a subject connected with India he 
would under ordinary circumstances preface what he had to say 
with an apology But the proverbial dullness attributed to Indian 
topics by Englishmen, he continued, did not reflect any particular 
credit on the latter, nor was it felt by the learned classes in any other 
country Then he described the situation on the Continent. 

No one can observe the course of modern thought and enquiry on the 
Continent, and especially Germany, without seeing that India, so far 
from being regarded as the least attractive of subjects, is rather looked 
upon as the most exciting, as the freshest, as the fullest of new prob- 
lems and of the promise of new discoveries The fervour of enthusiasm 
which glows in the lines written by the greatest of German poets when 
the dramatic genius of the Hindoos first became known to him through 
the translation of Sakuntala , seems to have scarcely abated in the 
scholars of our day who follow philological studies and devote themselves 
to the new branches of investigation constantly thrown out by the 
sciences of Comparative Philology and Comparative Mythology No

one can avoid seeing that their view of India affects in some degree 
their view of England, and the community, which is stigmatised more 
systematically on the Continent than it is perhaps aware, as a nation of 
shopkeepers, is thought to have had a halo of romance spread around 
it by its great possession 

Seven years later, in 1882, Max Muller said the same thing, 
again at Cambridge, when delivering a course of lectures on India 
In England, he told his audience, a study of Sanskrit, and of the 
ancient poetry, the philosophy, the laws and the art of India was

looked upon at best as curious, but was considered by most people 
as useless and tedious, if not absurd Then he drew the contrast 

In France, Germany and Italy, even in Denmark, Sweden and Russia, 
there is a vague charm connected with the name of India One of the 
most beautiful poems in the German language is the Weisheit des 
Brahmanen , , the ‘Wisdom of the Brahman 5 , by Ruckert, to my mind 
more rich in thought and more perfect in form than even Goethe's 
West-osthcher Divan A scholar who studies Sanskrit in Germany is 
supposed to be initiated in the deep and dark mysteries of ancient 
wisdom, and a man who has travelled in India, even if he has only dis- 
covered Calcutta, or Bombay, or Madras, is listened to like another 
Marco Polo In England a student of Sanskrit is generally considered 
a bore, and an old Indian Civil Servant, if he begins to describe the 
marvels of Elephanta or the Towers of Silence, runs the risk of pro- 
ducing a count-out 

This was in every way natural, for the German and British in- 
volvements in India were of wholly different kinds The German 
interest was spontaneous, the product of a combined emotional and 
intellectual urge created by the Romantic Movement, whereas the 
British was forced, a by-product of the establishment of British 
political power In other words, the German interest was ideological 
and imaginative, the British practical and objective For the Germans 
the knowledge of India was an ingredient in a process of becoming , 
by the acquisition of which they wanted to make their European 
personality deeper and fuller They felt that India had thoughts and 
feelings which were different as well as complementary to theirs 
The Englishman would not even consider the possibility that any- 
thing from India could enrich his English personality His problem 
was what to do with India, an unwanted, troublesome and largely 
unintelligible possession for which his country was becoming 
politically responsible 

The Romantic Drang nach Osten , with India as its particular goal, 
refurbished the old Graeco-Roman notion of ex Onente lux , which 
tempted even Plotmus to think of going to India, and this urge 
proclaimed its faith quite early and explicitly Friedrich Schlegel 
declared, even before he knew Sanskrit himself, that it was in the 
East that the Europeans must look for the highest Romanticism 
After he had learnt the language — he could not have learnt much — 
he stated his conviction even more emphatically In his famous 



126 SCHOLAR EXTRAORDINARY 

JJber die Sprache und Weisheit der Indier (On the Language and 
Wisdom of the Hindus), which he published in 1808, he issued 
what might be called the manifesto of a new Renaissance for 
Europe from India 

If the study of the Indian language [he wrote] were able to find only a 
few men to pursue it\* Thus in Italy and in Germany in the fifteenth 
and sixteenth centuries was seen a sudden outburst of an ardent love 
for Greek and Latin literature within a very short period of time, so 
that through a rediscovered knowledge of antiquity the whole aspect 
of science or to be more exact that of the world came to be changed 
and as it were renovated Not less sweeping, not less general, we ven- 
ture to say, will be the result of Indian studies, if they are undertaken 
with equal ardour and if they are introduced into the classical circle of 
learning in Europe And why should it not be so ? 

Though this fervent expectation from India had come into exis- 
tence without any worthwhile acquaintance with Indian literature 
and history among the German pre-Romantics and Romantics, it 
was actually sustained and developed by the objective and pains- 
taking work in India of a number of English Orientalists who, in 
whatever leisure they could secure from their administrative work, 
tried to collect as much reliable information about the history and 
civilization of their Hindu subjects as they could, men like Sir 
William Jones, Wilkins, Colebrooke, Halhed, to mention only the 
more important figures They were aided and encouraged in this 
work by the policy of Warren Hastings, who believed in and 
patronized Oriental learning both from intellectual curiosity and a 
realization of its importance for the rightful governing of India 
which, according to his own conviction, could be done only in the 
Indian way These scholars founded the Asiatic Society of Bengal 
m 1784, began to publish their work in its journal, Asiatic Re- 
searches , and within ten years a number of important Sanskrit works 
m translation made it possible for men of letters in Europe to form 
some adequate idea of what Sanskrit literature was like. The key 
works and dates of this early phase were as follows Bhagavad-Gita 
by Wilkins in 1785; his Httopadesa in 1787, Sakuntala by Sir 
William Jones in 1789; Gita-Govinda by Jones in 1792. 

None of these men, with the exception of Sir William Jones, had 
enthusiasm in the slightly pejorative connotation of the age, and 
even Jones did not allow his enthusiasm for ancient India to sup-

press his scientific spirit On the other hand Colebrooke, who made 
the most substantial contributions to the extant body of information 
about the Hindu past, was the coolest and the most rigorous of 
them all As a young official in India he at first even resisted the 
enthusiasm of the local Orientalists, considering it facile and super- 
ficial But his accuracy and industry made him the foremost scholar 
among them when he applied himself to Indian subjects 

But their work had a sensational effect in Germany, where the 
Asiatic Researches were read, along with the other books, with an 
almost delirious interest Of all the early books it was Jones’s trans- 
lation of Kalidasa’s Sakuntala which produced the most powerful 
impression He published it from Calcutta under the title of 
Sacontala or The Fatal Ring An Indian Drama , and it went into 
five impressions immediately and made Jones famous all over 
Europe. Herder wrote to one of his friends 

Do you not wish with me that instead of these endless religious books 
of the Vedas , Upavedas , and U pang as , they would give us the more 
useful and more agreeable works of the Indians, and especially their 
best poetry of every kind ? It is here that the mind and character of a 
nation is best brought to life before us, and I gladly admit that I have 
received a truer and more real notion of the manner of thinking among 
the ancient Indians from this one Sakuntala , than from all their 
Upangas and Bagavedams 

Goethe’s apostrophe to Sakuntala is, of course, famous 

Willte Du die Bluthe des fruhnen, die Fruchte des spateren Jahres, 
Willt Du, was reizt und entzuckt, willt Du was sattigt und nahrt, 
Willt Du den Himmel, die Erde mit emem Namen begreifen, 

Nenn ich, Sacontala , Dich, und so ist Alles gesagt 

(Wilt Thou the blossom of spring and the fruits that are later in season, 
Wilt Thou have charms and delights, wilt Thou have strength and 
support, Wilt Thou with one short word encompass the earth and 
heaven, All is said if I name only, Sacontala , Thee.) 

Goethe wrote this when he was getting tired of the intellectual 
Charlotte von Stem and finding a different kind of happiness in the 
arms of his bettschatz (treasure of the bed), Christiane Vulprns, 
whom the proud Weimar ladies called his Tatter Half’ Perhaps he 
saw in the unsophisticated hermitage girl that Sakuntala was, an 
etherealized Christiane

Goethe's admiration of Sakuntala is however just symbolic, and 
it is referred to only because of his great name He was not in the 
mam stream of Orientalism in Germany, literary or speculative 
He was not interested either in Hindu religion or in Hindu philo- 
sophy, and felt a kinship solely with such Sanskrit poetry as he 
could read in translation Hindu art repelled him, the worshipper 
of the Apollo Belvedere, and he wrote ‘The tiresome trunks of 
elephants, the coiling nests of crawling snakes, the age-old tortoise 
m its cosmic swamp, those kingly heads on a single trunk — such 
things will turn us mad 5 And he cried T should like to live in India, 
if only there had been no stone-masons there 9 

The typical impact of ancient Hindu India on the German mmd 
was seen in the true Romantics who came later — the two Schlegels, 
Novahs, Tieck, Jean-Paul Richter, Ruckert and the like, and among 
philosophers in Schopenhauer above all, but in Hegel and Schellmg 
too The first contacts with the authentic literature from India 
produced the most uncritically enthusiastic notions about the signi- 
ficance of Hindu civilization Sanskrit was represented as the 
mother of all languages The beginnings of all language, of all 
thought and of all religion were traced back to India F Schlegel 
even thought that the architectural monuments of Hindu India were 
as old as the Egyptian \* 

Bearing this attitude in mmd, in 1840 H H Wilson, the leading 
English Sanskritist of his time, who distrusted the German school of 
Sanskrit, wrote in the preface to his translation of the Vishnu 
Purana 

It is the boast of inductive philosophy that it draws its conclusions 
from the careful observation and accumulation of facts, and it is 
equally the busmess of all philosophical research to determine facts 
before it ventures upon speculation This procedure has not been 
observed in the investigation of the mythology and traditions of the 
Hindus Impatience to generalize has availed itself greedily of what- 
ever promised to afford materials for generalization, and the most 
erroneous views have been confidently advocated, because the guides 
to which their authors trusted were ignorant or insufficient 

In the first thirty years of the mneteenth century, following some 
twenty of the eighteenth, as A W Schlegel said, Europe had 
acquired more knowledge about India, both ancient and modern, 
than she had obtained in the twenty-one centuries since Alexander

the Great This knowledge was assimilated in Germany in two 
ways First India, or whatever the Germans of that age looked upon 
as India, was absorbed as an element in the German selfhood, 
poetical as well as philosophical, which was expanding under the 
many-sided influence of the Romantic Movement, and in that 
absorption there was no India per se but only India as a colouring 
material of the stuff of German thought and feeling In the second 
approach India was treated as the primary object of investigation 
This activity manifested itself in the growth of a definite German 
school of Sanskrit and of Indology in a number of universities, and 
this school built up through erudition a German image or idea in 
the Platonic sense of India But though not unscientific, that 
image too was very characteristically German— a projection of the 
German Weltanschauung on India It was based wholly on an exege- 
sis of books, and was an intellectual and imaginative but also a very 
selective reconstruction of the Hindu civilization and mind The 
length to which German speculation could go in pursuing its quest 
of India is very forcefully illustrated in Hegel, who wrote in his 
Philosophy of History 

India has always been the land of imaginative inspiration, and appears 
to us still as a fairy region, an enchanted world In contrast with the 
Chmese state which presents only the most prosaic understanding, 
India is the region of phantasy and sensibility It is in the interest of 
spirit that external conditions should become mternal ones, and that 
the natural and the spiritual world should be recognized in the sub- 
jective aspect as belongmg to intelligence, by which process the unity 
of subjectivity and being generally — or the idealism of existence — is 
established This idealism is found in India, but only as an idealism of 
imagination In India the state of absolute being is presented as in 
the ecstatic state of a dreaming condition, and therefore in India was 
to be found, not the dreaming of an actual individual, but the dreaming 
of the absolute spirit\* 

The German historical reconstruction of India was not quite this 
castle in the very rarefied air of German philosophy Its feet at least, 
if not the head as well, was in touch with the Indian soil Even so, 
it was also a German structure built on concrete piles driven into 
the very treacherous morass of dependable knowledge about 
ancient India. It created the myth of Indian spirituality, which still 
haunts the world as part of two modern phenomena, the Hindu

chauvinism of our day, and the spiritual degeneracy of the contem- 
porary West 

Gradually however the absorption of India into the German per- 
sonality stopped, and the foundation of the German Empire in 1870 
is the key event in this eclipse On the other hand, the intellectual 
and scholarly interest too lost its pioneering spirit and its initial 
fervour The urge to discover a new world of thought and feeling 
m India weakened, and Indology became an established academic 
discipline concerned with filling out the gaps and correcting the 
details of the structure already created 
As early as 1859, when Max Muller published his first book on 
ancient Sanskrit literature, he had become conscious of this drift 
towards ossification He remarked that the progress of Sanskrit 
philology was being retarded by an affectation of learned pedantry, 
which had done so much mischief to Greek and Latin scholarship 
and which he had resented in his university days. He admitted that 
the specialist in Sanskrit had much to learn from the methods of a 
Bentley or a Hermann, but he also observed\* 

But in Greek and Latin scholarship the distinction between useful and 
useless knowledge has almost disappeared, and the real objects of the 
study of these ancient languages have been wellnigh forgotten More 
than half of the publications of classical scholars have tended only to 
impede our access to the master- works of the ancients , and a sanction 
has been given to a kind of learning, which, however creditable to the 
individual, is of no benefit to the public at large A similar spirit has 
infected Sanskrit philology Sanskrit texts have been edited, on which 
no rational man ought to waste his time Essays have been written on 
subjects on which it is folly to be wise 

In England, too, the great exploratory and garnering adventure 
of the early English Orientalists finally became a specialized aca- 
demic discipline But before they converged on that ground, the 
British and German learning of Sanskrit and ancient Hindu India 
ran along different, though parallel, courses The very first dif- 
ference was that even to the end of the nineteenth century the 
British learning never wholly lost its utilitarian object of being an 
aid and instrument in governing India But this help was sought by 
the British political authorities in the form of information, and never 
as an ideology to shape policies or even outlooks. This attitude in- 
fluenced even those who officially represented Christianity and

Christian morals in India, namely, the ecclesiastical establishment 
of the Government of India With a few distinguished exceptions 
the regular clergy in India left the cultivation of Sanskrit and the 
languages derived from it to the missionaries This, H H Wilson 
wrote in 1830, had had the harmful consequence of depriving the 
Christian presence in India of the means of exercising its proper 
religious and moral influence on Indians As he put it. 

They have been unable to communicate freely with the Hindus, and 
have consequently failed to exercise that influence over them which it is 
likely they might enjoy to a much greater extent than the Missionaries 
In Bengal the better order of Hindus regard the Missionaries with feel- 
ings of inveterate animosity, whilst they invariably express a high re- 
spect for the clergymen of the Established Church They cannot avoid 
seeing that the latter are held in higher estimation by the European 
society, and that they cannot be reproached with practices which not 
infrequently degrade the Missionary character in the eyes of the 
Natives Did the regular clergy add to their personal respectability a 
reputation for scholarship in Indian literature, particularly the litera- 
ture which the Hindus themselves consider as classical and sacred, 
consequences of the most important and beneficial nature might be 
confidently predicted 

This of course did not happen, and could hardly be expected to 
happen, on account of the very narrow and severely practical view 
of the place of Sanskrit learning held by the British authorities 
The second important difference between the British and Ger- 
man schools of Sanskrit learning was that the British throughout 
remained in touch with the indigenous tradition of Sanskrit learning 
continued by the pandits in their time, which the Germans depre- 
cated when they did not wholly reject it as obsolete or dead If this 
prevented the British Orientalists from building castles in the air, 
it also made them infuse some of the decadence, artificiality and 
fossilization present in the survival of Hindu culture among the 
pandits into their conception of Hindu civilization. They could not 
reconstruct an ancient India which was independent of the India 
of their age In other words, their account of ancient India never 
became so genuinely historical as was the reconstruction in the nine- 
teenth century of classical antiquity by European historians of 
Greece and Rome 

The third difference between Germany and Britain in respect of 



132 SCHOLAR EXTRAORDINARY 

Hindu civilization was that the English people did not accept it as 
an element in their mental formation and their cultural activity 
This result could never be expected from them when they were not 
ready to accept the Hindu heritage even for governing India There 
were a number of basic reasons for this rejection, the most important 
being their first-hand knowledge of living Hindus and of their ways 
The British in India found them to be so crude and ignorant and 
even degenerate that they could hardly believe that they had been 
highly civilized at any time Secondly, the positive and active ideo- 
logy for the government of India, which developed after Warren 
Hastings and which admitted any possibility of progress on the 
part of the Indian people, was based on three schools of English 
political thinking Utilitarianism, Evangelism and Whig Libera- 
lism All these were hostile to the beliefs and customs of the Hindus 
which they regarded as stagnant and obscurantist Lastly, the idea 
of ancient India which the British Orientalists were putting for- 
ward appeared to all progressive Englishmen as archaistic and retro- 
gressive So all those who represented the progressive or liberal side 
of British rule in India discounted the value, and partly even the 
existence, of the Hindu civilization 
No one was more forthright in holding and expressing such a 
view than James Mill, the Utilitarian, who held an influential posi- 
tion in India House in London In his History of British India , 
which was published in 1817 and immediately became a classic, he 
attacked the idea that the Hindus were in any sense highly civilized 
at any period The whole of his second book is a coldly contemp- 
tuous dismissal and denunciation of the Hindus as creators and 
products of a high culture In later editions of the book H H 
Wilson tried to correct Mill’s bias in running footnotes disputing 
all his generalizations Even so Max Muller thought that the book 
was responsible for some of the greatest misfortunes that had hap- 
pened to India Every aspect of Hindu life and culture was taken 
up by Mill and described from a standpoint opposite to that of the 
Orientalists, and the garment made by them was turned inside out. 
It was in demolishing their idea of Sanskrit literature that Mill was 
most ruthless Among peoples who were just entering a civilized 
state, Mill said, all literary expression was in verse The literature 
of the Hindus had always remained in this first state 
Mill more specifically made both the book which established the 
idea of a great literature in Sanskrit, and the man who was respon-

sible for presenting it to Europe, the objects of his criticism Of 
Sacontala he said that though it had some pretty passages, as a 
whole it was not a 'story which was above the powers of imagination 
m an uncultivated age’ and there was nothing in it ‘which either 
accorded with the understanding or could gratify the fancy of an 
instructed people 5 Of Sir William Jones he spoke with regret and 
even some disapproval ‘It was unfortunate that a mind so pure, so 
warm in the pursuit of truth, and so devoted to oriental learmng, 
as that of Sir William Jones, should have adopted the hypothesis of a 
high state of civilization in the principal countries of Asia 5 

Nevertheless Mill succeeded in spreading a view which became 
influential and determined policy In Macaulay his disparagement 
of Sanskrit literature became a cool appraisal, and the basis for the 
support given to English as the medium of education in India In 
his famous minute on education in India written on February 2, 
1835, he wrote about Sanskrit literature 

I have no knowledge of either Sanscrit or Arabic But I have done 
what I could to form a correct estimate of their value I have read 
translations of the most celebrated Arabic and Sanscrit works I have 
conversed both here and at home with men distinguished by their pro- 
ficiency in the Eastern tongues I am quite ready to take the Oriental 
learning at the valuation of the Orientalists themselves I have never 
found one among them who could deny that a single shelf of a good 
European library was worth the whole native literature of India and 
Arabia The intrinsic superiority of Western literature is, indeed, fully 
admitted by those members of the Committee who support the 
Oriental plan of education It is, I believe, no exaggeration to say 
that all the historical information which has been collected from all the 
books written in the Sanscrit language is less valuable than what may 
be found in the most paltry abridgements used at preparatory schools 
in England In every branch of physical or moral philosophy the rela- 
tive position of the two nations is nearly the same 

The disparaging thesis, promulgated by two men who were 
regarded as the greatest authorities on India of their age, persisted 
and was not wholly discredited even in the twentieth century In 
1917 William Archer, the dramatic critic, published a book entitled 
India and the Future , in which he denied that India was civilized in 
the accepted European sense. I myself remember the scandal it 
raised, and its refutation came, among others from Aravmda Ghosh, 
more famous under the name of Shri Aurobindo.

Of course, in spite of the detractors, the English Orientalists 
carried on their researches as scholars and their propaganda as 
apologists But their discoveries and views as well as their defence 
built up only a counter-thesis for those who were seriously interested 
m ancient India As for the educated British public, at their most 
understanding and sympathetic they recognized ancient Indian 
culture as a civilization in being at one time, but which was also for 
them a thing apart The majority were indifferent, except when 
they looked at things Indian as curiosities Outside a circle of more 
or less charlatanesque dabblers and pedlars of Indian spirituality, 
there was no disposition to assign any universal human value to the 
religion, philosophy, literature and art of the Hindus 

Max Muller avoided both extremes, the callow German en- 
thusiasm and the hardboiled English contempt He adopted and 
retained in his attitude to India the strongest and the most sympa- 
thetic features of the interest in that country of both Englishmen 
and Germans He never shed the enthusiasm he had imbibed from 
the Romantic Movement, nor the pioneering spirit of the early days 
of Sanskritic studies Driven by the ideological motivation of the 
German Indophiles, he continued to seek the origins of religion and 
thought through a study of ancient Indian literature He also believed 
that it had a value for all men and for all time But he derived from 
the English Orientalists his conviction of the practical importance 
of Sanskrit for British administrators as well as for contemporary 
Hindus He thought and said that British rule would be more 
understanding and sympathetic, and therefore more productive of 
good for the Indian people if the ruling order became familiar with 
their culture On the other hand, he expected a regeneration of the 
life of the Hindus by bringing their own cultural heritage to their 
knowledge Lastly, he showed the most humane side of the English 
scholarly interest in India by becoming not only an apologist but a 
very vigorous champion of Hindu culture, and telling Englishmen 
how much they had to learn from India By combining all these 
positions in his function of Indologist, he maintained the primacy 
of England in Sanskritic studies in the Western world / 

He proclaimed the larger purpose of Sanskrit philology quite 
emphatically in the introduction to the first book he wrote on San- 
skrit literature A History of Ancient Sanskrit Literature , published 
in 1859 He wrote. 



THE RIG- VEDA 


135 


The object and aim of philology, in its highest sense, is but one, to 
learn what man is, by learning what man has been With this principle 
for our pole-star, we shall never lose ourselves, though engaged in the 
most minute and abstruse inquiries Our own studies may seemingly 
refer to matters that are but secondary and preparatory, to the clear- 
ance, so to say, of the rubbish which passing ages have left on the 
monuments of the human mind But we shall never mistake that rub- 
bish for the monuments which it covers If, then, it is the aim of 
Sanskrit philology to supply one of the earliest and most important 
links in the history of mankind, we must go to work historically, that 
is we must begin, as far as we can, with the beginning, and then trace 
gradually the growth of the Indian mind, in its various manifestations, 
as far as the remaining monuments allow us to follow this course 

The primary object of Muller’s Sanskrit studies was thus neither 
philology nor literature as such, but the evolution of religious and 
philosophical thought Indeed, to his history of ancient Sanskrit 
literature he added the qualification ‘so far as it illustrates the 
primitive religion of the Brahmans’ Therefore he was bound to 
specialize in Vedic literature Mentioning the fact that all later San- 
skrit books on religion, law and philosophy refer back to one early 
and unique authority called by the comprehensive name of the Veda, 
he wrote 

It is with the Veda, therefore, that Indian philosophy ought to begin 
if it is to follow a natural and historical course So great an influence 
has the Vedic age (the historical period to which we are justified in 
referring the formation of the sacred texts) exercised upon all suc- 
ceeding periods of Indian history, so closely in every branch of litera- 
ture connected with Vedic traditions, so deeply have the religious and 
moral ideas of that primitive era taken root in the mind of the Indian 
nation, so minutely has almost every private and public act of Indian 
life been regulated by old traditionary precepts, that it is impossible 
to find the right point of view for judging of Indian religion, morals, 
and literature without a knowledge of the literary remains of the 
Vedic age 

But in actual fact, Muller’s study of Sanskrit literature did not 
begin at its starting point, and in the circumstances it could not 
The early European Orientalists could not begin the study of San- 
skrit and Sanskrit literature with the earliest books in the language. 
As Max Muller pointed out, the Hellenists began where they ought 



136 SCHOLAR EXTRAORDINARY 

to begin, namely, with Homer, Herodotus and Thucydides, and not 
with Anacreontic poetry or Neo-Platomst philosophy But the 
Orientalists concerned with ancient India had to begin with later 
books, like the code of Manu , the Gita , the Hitopadesa , Sakuntala 
and such works in classical Sanskrit At that stage of Sanskntic 
studies no authentic text of the Vedas was available, nor was Yedic 
Sanskrit known 

So Max Muller also began with classical Sanskrit literature, and 
he also shared the current admiration for it His first work in San- 
skrit scholarship was a translation of the Hitopadesa But from the 
beginning his mam interest was in ideas, and therefore he had been 
drawn towards the ZJpanishads> though he had also read a little of 
the Rig -Veda 

In later life, in a letter to Gladstone (January 18, 1883), Max 
Muller described this backward progression of Sanskntic research 
from classical Sanskrit literature to early Vedic literature, and also 
explained its significance In presenting Gladstone with a copy of 
his lectures on India delivered at Cambridge in 1882 he tried to 
interest the great statesman, and he wrote 

I must confess I have long wished for an opportunity of engaging your 
interest in behalf of India , I do not mean the mere surface India, with 
its grotesque religion, its pretty poetry, and its fabulous antiquity, but 
the real India that is only slowly emerging before our eyes, a whole, 
almost forgotten act in the great drama of humanity, very different 
from Greece, from Rome, from modern Europe, and yet not so 
different that in studying it we cannot feel that mutato nomine de nobis 
fabula narratur The discovery of that real India, of that new intellec- 
tual hemisphere, is to my mind a far greater discovery than that of 
Vasco da Gama’s 

Then he described the manner in which this India of his was 
recovered and studied 

It was a misfortune [he observed] that all early publications of Sanskrit 
texts belonged really to the Renaissance of Sanskrit literature Kali- 
dasa’s plays, which were supposed to be contemporaneous with Virgil, 
belong to the sixth century, the Laws of Manu, which Sir William 
Jones placed 1280 b c , cannot be older than 300 a d But there was an

growth from the simplest beginnings to the highest concepts which the

human mind is capable of, it is there that we can learn what man is, 

by seeing once more what man has been 

As an old admirer of Gladstone, Max Muller hoped that he would 
look at the work the Sanskrit scholars had been doing recently, but 
he was also realistic enough to see that the fulfilment of his desire 
was not to be expected However, the letter very clearly explained 
the beginning of Vedic studies 

As has been mentioned in a previous chapter, it was after going 
to Pans and meeting Burnouf that, following the old scholar’s 
advice, Muller decided to make the Rig-Veda the mam subject of 
his researches When he saw Burnouf the latter told him ‘We 
know what is in the Upanishads , but we want the hymns and their 
native comments.’ 

Burnouf made his advice even more explicit ‘Either one thing 
or the other Either study Indian philosophy and begin with the 
Upanishads and Sankara’s commentary, or study Indian religion 
and keep to the Rig-Veda , and copy the hymns and Sayana’s com- 
mentary, and then you will be our great benefactor ’ He insisted 
more particularly on publishing the commentary on the Rig-Veda 
by Sayanacharya, which dates from the fourteenth century ‘Don’t 
publish the extracts from the commentary only,’ he added ‘If you 
do, you will publish what is easy to read, and leave out what is diffi- 
cult ’ Max Muller thought that it would be very difficult to find a 
publisher for so large a work, but when he confided his fear, said 
‘The Commentary must be published, depend on it, and it will be ’ 
So Max Muller was launched on the project which kept him en- 
gaged for thirty years 

At this time the study of the Vedic literature was in a very rudi- 
mentary state The legend of the Veda as the ‘AryanBible’ had been 
created long before the true text of the Rig-Veda was known The 
earliest authentic account of Vedic literature was given by Cole- 
brooke in his paper ‘On the Vedas or Sacred Writings of the 
Hindus’, published in the Asiatic Researches , vol VIII, printed in 
Calcutta in 1805, and for decades this essay remained the basis of all 
serious and scholarly discussion on the subject The only printed 
text available was that of the first book of the Rig-Veda , edited with 
a Latm translation and incomplete notes (also in Latin) by Rosen, 
and published in 1838 in London by the Oriental Translation Fund 
of Great Britain and Ireland. It was by basing himself on this text

supplemented by the manuscripts in the Bibliotheque Royale that 
Burnouf lectured on the Rig-Veda But he never published any 
extensive work on it His incidental comments are embodied in his 
commentary on the Yagna 

Burnouf not only told Muller what Vedic mss were to be found 
m the Bibliotheque Royale, but lent him his own mss Muller then 
began to copy and collate all the manuscripts he could use, but he 
found to his astonishment that he was making many mistakes 
Therefore, in order to avoid the extra labour of comparing his own 
copies with the originals, he devised a method of using transparent 
paper and tracing every letter At first his progress was slow, but 
with practice he increased his speed, and his materials grew in 
extent and value 

Max Muller trod a lonely path, and worked independently of the 
other Sanskntists in the field, though he was engaged on a task 
which was most important and urgent in connexion with the Rig- 
Veda, namely, the publication of a full text with the commentary of 
Sayana Rudolph Roth, who with Muller, became the most notable 
scholar on the Rig-Veda , was several years his senior But they never 
got on well together, though they were fellow-pupils of Burnouf 

It has already been related how Muller came to England to carry 
on his work and secured the patronage of the East India Company, 
and how at last he settled at Oxford because the printing was being 
done by the University Press The work had begun in the early part 
of 1847 as soon as th e question of financing it had been decided At 
first progress was slow because many of the types had to be manu- 
factured, and printing Sanskrit needed 300 types What surprised 
Muller when he was superintending the printing from London was 
that on the proofs many of his own mistakes on the copy were either 
corrected or queried At last he asked if there was a Sanskrit scholar 
at Oxford who was doing this He was told that there was none, but 
that it was the compositor himself, who did not know a word of 
Sanskrit, who was responsible for both When at Oxford he asked 
the man how he came to make the corrections ‘Well, sir, my arm 
gets mto a regular swing from one compartment of types to another, 
and there are certain movements which never occur. So, if I sud- 
denly have to take up types which entail a new movement I feel it, 
and I put a query 9 Of course, this was due to the fact that in all 
languages certain combinations (like s following an h in English) 
can never occur, and these impossibilities are numerous in Sanskrit 



THE RIG-VEDA 


139 

But by July 1847 the first two sheets of the text of the Rig-Veda 
were printed off, and on July 13, he sent them to Burnouf in Pans, 
followed by the first sheet of the commentary by Sayana on October 
8 His object in doing so was to obtain Burnouf’s opinion on the 
soundness of the general principle of printing and style that he had 
adopted The old scholar sent his enthusiastic approval in a letter 
written on November 9, 1847, writing T thank you for having sent 
me the sheets of your grand edition of the Rig-Veda I use the word 
grand, not to avoid saying excellent, for I consider it both grand and 
excellent, but because I must express my admiration of Professor 
Wilson’s fine and vigorous Devanagari type ’ 

As to the quality of the editing, Burnouf said T must own that 
I am astonished that in so short a time you have been able to master 
the mass of materials in hand 5 Then the old scholar and pioneer in 
France of Vedic studies, concluded with a generosity which is not 
common among specialists He wrote 

I congratulate you with all my heart on your debut, and I venture to 
say on your success, for your success is secured It is a great delight 
to do it for a man whose knowledge I admire and whose character I 
love And I think I may be allowed to reflect with pleasure on any 
effort I may have made to encourage you to march on in entire inde- 
pendence, avoiding all collaborations This is the only thing on 
which I can pride myself, and again it is entirely to your honour, be- 
cause it only proves that I recognized all that science might expect 
from you 


Anything nobler from an old scholar to a scholar of twenty-six 
can hardly be imagined. 

Max Muller steadily produced the sheets, and in two years 
finished the editing and printing of the first volume, which was 
published at the end of 1849 The Oxford University Press must be 
given the credit for producing a volume which in its beauty of 
typography and layout recalled to me some of the early incunabula 
from the presses of Aldus and Jenson The volume, a heavy quarto, 
was presented to the British Museum by the Court of Directors of 
the East India Company It is in mint condition, and on its flyleaf is 
pasted a letter in the beautiful handwriting of the day, forwarding 
it and explaining the scope of the work

SCHOLAR EXTRAORDINARY 


Sir, 

The Court of Directors of the East India Company impressed with 
a sense of the great Literary and Antiquarian Value of the ‘Rig-Veda 
Sanhtta 3 or Sacred Hymns of the Brahmans as containing important 
facts relating to the early Religion, History, and Language of the 
Hindoos, and actuated by a desire to perpetuate and render the Work 
accessible to the World of Letters, have authorized the publication at 
the Company’s expense of an Edition of the Manuscript, together 
with its Sanskrit Commentary by Sayanacharya , and the First Volume 
of the Work, which it is expected will be comprized in four volumes has 
now issued from the Press, Edited by Dr Max Muller of Berlin, under 
the general superintendence of Professor H H Wilson, the Com- 
pany’s Librarian 

The Work is intended for sale to those who may desire to possess it, 
but it is the intention of the Court to make gratuitous distribution of 
Copies to certain Public Institutions, and to a few distinguished indi- 
viduals, and the Court have commanded me to state that they have 
much pleasure in presenting a Copy of the first Volume, which is here- 
with forwarded for deposit in the Library of the British Museum 

The remaining volumes will be forwarded in like manner as they 
successively appear 

They were, and the six volumes of the first edition in the Depart- 
ment of Oriental Printed Books and Manuscripts of the British 
Museum are this presentation set bound in morocco 

One particular feature of bibliographical interest in this volume 
might be mentioned It had a second title-page in Sanskrit, in 
which Max Muller Sanskritized the names of Germany, Oxford 
and himself respectively as Sharmanya Desha (the Brahmimc 
country), Ukshatarana (ford of the Ox), and Bhatta Moksha Mulara 
(the learned Moksha Mulara, the nearest Sanskrit-sounding equiva- 
lent to his name, but later translated by the pandits of India as the 
‘giver of the root of salvation’ by means of an etymological flight 
worthy of Sayanacharya himself) Since, in boyhood, I often saw 
him mentioned as Moksha Mulara in Bengali magazines and books, 
I assumed that we in India had transformed his name mto an Indian 
form But from the first volume of his edition I discovered that it 
was Muller himself who was responsible for this 
After the publication of the first volume Muller proceeded with 
the preparation of the second volume, but his appointment as 
Deputy Taylorian Professor of Modern Languages prevented his 
giving full attention to the Rig-Veda Still he carried on for more

than two years, and finished the preparation of the greater part of 
volume two But towards the end of 1852 he fell ill, and found it 
advisable to follow the advice Bunsen had long been giving him, to 
engage an assistant for the Rig-Veda Bunsen also seems to have 
suggested the name of a Sanskrit scholar in Berlin, Dr Aufrecht 
Muller entered mto negotiations with him, and Aufrecht arrived at 
Oxford in the middle of December 1852 As this step was to pro- 
duce a very unpleasant sequel for Max Muller, and after his death 
for his wife, it is necessary to describe his relations with his assistant 
m some detail Early in December Muller wrote to Bunsen £ I expect 
Aufrecht daily You have always advised me to seek help, and I 
could no longer get through my work alone, with the many inter- 
ruptions caused by my health Aufrecht is a very conscientious 
scholar, and as far as the rest goes that will be all right ’ 

After that Muller reported to his mother on December 19 ‘Dr 
Aufrecht is a very clever man, a Sanskritist, etc. We work together, 
and he helps me with my Veda , for which I pay him enough to live 
here We shall try the plan at first for six months, and I hope it will 
go well. 5 

Aufrecht as a scholar seems to have been of the type which made 
Mock Turtle describe his classical master as an old crab Besides, 
he had not been baptized, and that caused him mental unsettle- 
ment So after a few weeks’ association with him Muller again 
wrote to his mother, on February 2, 1853 

I get on better with Aufrecht, but not so very well yet He decidedly 
desires to be baptized, but he does not feel inclined to talk to others on 
this point or anything connected with it It is possible that when he 
has once taken this step he may get to feel more inner satisfaction and 
confidence in friends But there can be no question about working 
together , for as soon as one presses him a little hard he draws his head 
mto a shell like a tortoise But I still hope that in time things will 
take a better shape 

Seventeen days later Muller writes to his mother again, and says 
‘I am very well and happy Aufrecht begins to “thaw”.’ During the 
Easter holidays of 1853 Aufrecht, according to his own wishes, was 
baptized by Bunsen’s son, Henry, who was an Anglican clergyman 
and Rector of Lilleshall 

The second volume of the Rig-Veda was published early in 1854, 
and in its preface, dated Christmas, 1853, Max Muller formally 



142 SCHOLAR EXTRAORDINARY 

acknowledged Aufrecht’s help for the first time in these words Tn 
the latter portion of this volume I have been able to avail myself of 
the assistance and active co-operation of my learned friend Dr 
Aufrecht of Berlin, and the benefit hence derived cannot be too 
highly valued 5 

On March 10 he wrote to his mother ‘Aufrecht is still working 
for me, but he lives in another house for himself, and gives private 
lessons He is happy here, and very useful to me, but it is rather 
expensive ’ 

At the beginning of 1855 Aufrecht decided to leave Max Muller 
and Oxford, and to go to London, So Muller wrote to Bunsen 
‘Aufrecht has at last made up his mind to go to London I have 
written to Dr Jelf, who may probably secure for him the Sanskrit 
Professorship at King’s College Aufrecht was too good for this 
mechanical work ’ 

In the preface to the third volume, published in 1856, Muller 
acknowledged Aufrecht’s assistance as follows T have had again 
for this volume the valuable assistance of my learned friend Dr 
Aufrecht, and I sincerely regret that I shall no longer enjoy this 
advantage ’ 

Finally, in the preface to the fourth volume published in 1862, 
Muller wrote 

I have stated on former occasions how much I owed to the assistance 
of my learned friend Professor Aufrecht, and I am glad to say that in 
the present volume also I have to a considerable extent had the benefit 
of his co-operation Though I regret his departure from Oxford, 
nothing could have been more beneficial to the interests of sound 
Sanskrit scholarship in this country than his appointment to the Chair 
of Sanskrit at Edinburgh 

After the departure of Aufrecht Muller secured the help of other 
young Sanskrit scholars, and carried through the work to its com- 
pletion by publishing the fifth volume in 1872 and the sixth in 1874 
On July 1 Max Muller wrote the last lines of his text of the Rtg~ 
Veda , and only the preface remained to be written 
The first International Congress of Orientalists was held in 
London from September 14 to 21, 1874 To it came all the dis- 
tinguished Oriental scholars of the day, including Max Muller’s 
first teacher of Sanskrit, Brockhaus Muller presided over the Aryan 
section and delivered a very eloquent address on the importance of 



THE RIG-VEDA 


143 


Oriental studies and learning At the end of the address he pre- 
sented the last sheet of the last volume of the Rtg-Veda to the Con- 
gress The volume was published at the end of the year, and in its 
preface he took leave of the work in the style of Gibbon ‘When I 
had written the last line of the Rtg-Veda and Sayana’s commentary, 
and put down my pen, I felt as if I had parted with an old, old 
friend ’ 

In the preface Muller also clearly explained how he had worked 
with his assistants and acknowledged their help 

I believe I have acknowledged, without stmt, whatever assistance I 
have received from other scholars durmg the progress of my work 
They themselves have assured me, that I have said more than they 
deserved or expected I have never liked the rule, followed by nearly 
all scholars, of not acknowledging services for which payment has 
been accepted But as it has been broadly hinted, that for certain por- 
tions of Sayana’s commentary, I had parted with my editorial respon- 
sibility, I take this opportunity of stating, once for all, that there is no 
page, no line, no word, no letter, no accent, in the whole commentary, 
for which I am not personally responsible 

At this point I must go back to Max Muller’s first detailed exami- 
nation and description of the Rtg-Veda and the whole of Vedic 
literature, which was published in 1859 Already, when he was com- 
pleting the first volume of his presentation of the text of the Rtg- 
Veda , Muller had written a long explanatory essay, both descriptive 
and historical, on Vedic literature, and he wished to print it as a pre- 
face to the volume With the approval of Bunsen he wrote a letter 
to the Court of Directors of the East India Company seeking per- 
mission to do so 

The Directors agreed to his petition, which was a great sui prise 
to Muller This happened thiough Bunsen’s intervention Max 
Muller thought he would print and publish it in England, and a note 
was inserted in the first volume announcing that an introductory 
memoir on the literature of the Vedas was ready for publication 
Ten sheets of the essay were printed by 1851, when he was 
appointed Deputy Taylorian Piofessor and had to give up the pro- 
ject for want of time. However, he adapted parts of the intended 
prolegomena into an essay for the Prix Volney awarded by the 
Institute of France The competition was hard, but Burnouf and 
other friends worked foi him, and e,\*rly in. October 1849 Burnouf 



144 SCHOLAR EXTRAORDINARY 

gave him the glad news that he had got the prize, which was 1,200 
francs 

For ten years Muller could do nothing further with the essay, 
but in 1859 he brought it out as his first full-length book, A History 
of Ancient Sanskrit Literature , and dedicated it to Horace Hayman 
Wilson, as ‘a token of admiration and gratitude by his pupil and 
friend, Max Muller' In the meanwhile, a good deal of work had 
been done by other scholars who had concerned themselves with 
the Vedas In the preface to his book Muller mentioned the names 
of Wilson, Burnouf, Lassen, Bemfey, Roth, Boehthngk, Kuhn, 
Regmer, Weber, Aufrecht, Whitney, among the most notable 
workers He himself had also published a short essay on the Vedas 
m 1853 He regretted that owing to external circumstances he had 
been anticipated by others in producing a general account of Vedic 
literature, but that regret was balanced by his satisfaction in finding 
that in the mam his original views had not been shaken either by his 
own further researches or by those of others Quite deliberately the 
preface of the book was dated August 3, 1859, ^he day of his wedding 
Like his marriage, the book was a great success It is surprising 
to note that this highly specialized book of 607 pages, containing 
in its index of 19 pages more than 1,500 Sanskrit words and names, 
and also Sanskrit citations in the text in Deva Nagan type, was com- 
pletely sold out in its first edition in less than five months, and a 
second edition had to be brought out in i860 There were also long 
and appreciative reviews not only in the learned journals but also 
in the newspapers The Times published a flattering review on 
December 30, 1859 Two of the scholarly reviews were by Wilson 
himself in the Edinburgh Review for October, i860 (the last thing 
he wrote, but published after his death), and by the great French 
Orientalist Barthelemy St Hilaire, in five articles in the Journal des 
Savants , the famous journal of scholarship 
The French scholar said that Muller's book showed considerable 
progress in Vedic studies and answered a number of questions, and, 
above all, it brought order and light into the huge and confused 
treasure-house of the primitive monuments of Brahmanic religion 
According to him the book was of so high an order that it was not 
likely to be surpassed or even equalled for a long time Wilson 
wrote Tt is not possible in a brief survey like the present to render 
justice to a work every page of which teems with information that 
no other scholar ever has, or could have, placed before the public \* 



THE RIG-VEDA 


145 


A third edition of the book was also called for But Max Muller 
thought that Yedic studies were making such rapid progress that 
with the time he could give to the subject he could not keep abreast 
of it His failure to get the Boden Professorship of Sanskrit at 
Oxford at the end of i860 made it impossible for him to devote 
himself exclusively to Sanskrit literature To carry on the publica- 
tion of the text of the Veda was in itself a task heavy enough So he 
never re-published this pioneering book 

But he did not feel happy about it In a letter to his wife written 
on December 7, 1864, he said ‘I still have a great work to do, and 
I often feel that I might have done a great deal more, if I kept the 
one object of my life more steadily in view I sometimes wish you 
would help me more in doing that, and insist on my working harder 
at the Veda and nothing else I hope I shall finish that work \* Then 
he explained to her how his edition and translation of the Veda 
was likely to help the Hindus in recovering the original spirit of 
their religion (see p 90) and observed ‘If those thoughts pass 
through one’s mind, one does grudge the hours and days and weeks 
that are spent in staying in people’s houses, and one feels that with 
the many blessings showered on one, one ought to be up and doing 
what may be God’s work ’ 

Notwithstanding his self-accusation, he continued to work on 
both the text and translation of the Rig-Veda Moreover, till almost 
the end of his life he never neglected any opportunity to explain the 
meaning and importance of the Vedas to a larger public He de- 
livered a long lecture at Leeds in March, 1865, before its Philoso- 
phical Institution, devoted five of his seven lectures at Cambridge 
m 1 88a to the Vedas , and, last of all, summed up his views on them 
in the second volume of Auld Lang Syne , containing recollections of 
his Indian friends, among whom he counted the Rig-Veda That 
was in 1898, two years before his death 

He even made use of social occasions to promote knowledge and 
respect for Vedic literature When the phonograph was invented 
one of its first appearances in England was at a party at the house of 
J. Fletcher Moulton, Q c , and afterwards in P There was a fashion- 
able company, with some eminent men of letters and men of science 
Among them was also the American journalist, a friend of Max 
Muller’s, Moncme D Conway, who in his long notice on Muller 
after his death, published in the North American Review , described 
the incident. I shall quote his account 



146 SCHOLAR EXTRAORDINARY 

Max Muller was first called on to utter something in the phonograph 
We presently heard issuing from it these sounds Agmm tie purohitam 
Yajnasya dev am ntvtjam — hotaram ratnadhatamam 
There was a burst of merriment when these queer sounds came from 
the machine, but a deep silence when Max Muller explained that we 
had heard words from the oldest hymn in the world — the first (if I 
remember rightly\*) in the Vedas ‘Agm I worship — the chief priest of 
the sacrifice — the divine priest — the invoker — conferring great wealth \* 

And then young people gathered round the smiling scholar to ask 
questions Moncure Conway did not hear exactly what Muller said 
to them because he 

stood apart observing the picturesqueness of the scene, and finding in 
it something symbolical of the whole career of the polite scholar He 
had evoked from the oral Sanskrit phonograph the ancient Aryan 
literature and mythology, the thin, metallic voices became real and 
cast their poetic spell not merely on the learned, but on fashionable 
young ladies and gentlemen in drawing-rooms, throughout Europe and 
America, adding vast estates to then minds, delivering them from the 
mere^pmhole views of humanity and of the universe to which our 
ancestors were limited 

I shall end this chapter by adding to Conway’s vivid account of 
the impact of his work on the Vedas , the observation on it of one of 
the leading Sanskrit and Vedic scholars of our times, in Louis 
Renou ‘Nul n’a contnhue davantage / he says in a monograph en- 
titled Les Maitres de la Philologie Vedique 3 c a creer le miracle vedique,
