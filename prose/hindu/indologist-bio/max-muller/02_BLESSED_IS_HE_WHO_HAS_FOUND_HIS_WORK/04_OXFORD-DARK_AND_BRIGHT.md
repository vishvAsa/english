OXFORD-DARK AND BRIGHT 

By the time Max Muller, as Taylorian Professor, had become an 
associate member, so to speak, of the academic club of Oxford — the 
date being February 1854 — the university had ceased to be the 
happy convent it was even in 1848 The Pax Oxomana was shat- 
tered at one stroke by the appointment of the Royal Commission of 
1850 As Mark Pattison said, if a man had fallen asleep in 1846 and 
woken up again in 1850 he would have found himself in a different 
world It was tom into two factions, the opponents and the sup- 
porters of reform The old guard was in power, and feeling ran so 
high against the renegades that one of them asked a junior professor 
to invite him to dinner because the heads of colleges would no longer 
admit him to their table Actually, the Commission made a dif- 
ference to the social habits of Oxford Before its appointment there 
were hardly any private dinners besides those in the halls But the 
Commission broke up the academic society into sets, and private 
dinners had to keep up the social life of those who were excluded 
from the high table on account of their support for reform 

The umversity as an official body refused to co-operate with the 
Commission It questioned not only the kind of reform that was 
proposed, but also the power of Parliament to legislate for Oxford 
‘The Government did not know Oxford, nor Oxford the Govern- 
ment/ was the accepted formula, and men who were thorough- 
going Erastians in always submitting to the supremacy of the State 
over the Anglican Church, now opposed the intervention of the 
State in the affairs of an organ of the same Church — the University 
of Oxford As Max Muller found, even those who thought reform 
necessary were afraid of calling in the government Some of them 
told him that if they once let in the government, it would interfere 
too much 

The case of the opponents of reform, a majority of whom cer- 
tainly put the vested interests of a closed corporation before 
education, was stated at its most idealistic and disinterested by Dr 
Pusey He was never in doubt about the basic issue, which in his 
eyes was clear should Oxford continue to be a religious body in

obedience to the intentions of the founders, or was it to become 
merely a seculai educational institution ? He had only one answer 
to the question He did not object to improvements, but declared 
firmly ‘Only let it be xeally solid, and, above all, under the control 
of a firm, unwavering faith, to the glory of God It will yet be well 
with Oxfoid if she forget not her own motto — Dominus illummatio 
mea ' None the less, the Commission reported, and the reform bill 
was passed What shocked the anti-reform men most was that 
Gladstone, the member for Oxford and at first an opponent of State 
interference, became a convert himself and carried through the 
reforming measures in Parliament For this he was to lose his seat 
later But reform was set in motion, and Dr Pusey, who was to fight 
the rearguard action against it to the last, could only lament Fuit 
Ilium, futt Ilium f — We were Trojans once, but Troy is gone 1 

Of course, old Oxford did not die at once For at least two 
decades it kicked very hard, and even after that a core of anti- 
reform opinion remained there, just as Jacobitism survived into the 
Hanoverian age The most characteristic expression of the conser- 
vative attitude is to be found in seven volumes of reproductions of 
Oxford caricatures preserved in the Bodleian Satire is always con- 
servative, as the whole tradition from Aristophanes to Punch proves 
3o were these caricatures, and even more so their captions, in 
nany instances in faultless Greek or Latin, which showed that 
eform had served even the satirists by raising the level of classical 
iducation at Oxford 

As was to be expected, all the champions of reform came in for 
heir share of ridicule or censure, and most of all Jowett, who was 
lot only a very active reformer, but was also suspected of having a 
jood deal of arriere-pensee in his reforming zeal 

Academic refoim at Oxford in the second half of the nineteenth 
entury, like parliamentary reform, was earned out in three stages, 
►efore and after 1854 by a commission of inquiry, an Act of Parha- 
rient and an executive commission There was in 1872 another 
ommission of inquiry, and an Act of 1877 This was followed by 
n executive commission from 1877 to 1881 As a result, there was 
ubstantial improvement in details of organization as \*vell as teach- 
ig But there was no revolutionary change in the university's formal 
ructure and functioning For instance, the very basil issues which 
le reformers had raised, such as the relation betwecnlhe university 
id the colleges, the imbalance between professori jf and tutorial

teaching, of the extension of research, were dealt with superficially 
and remained open even till after the First World War, when they 
had to be examined again 

Nevertheless, a great change certainly came over the spirit in 
which Oxford carried on its work This was due far less to the specific 
measures of reform than to the Zeitgeist , illustrating the invariable 
principle that it is the society which shapes the educational system, 
and not the system the society 

Once anybody wanted to see it, the basic transformation was all 
too obvious As an institution, from having been an educational 
monastery run by a clerical oligarchy deriving its authority from an 
overwhelmingly clerical franchise of Masters of Art, the university 
became for all practical purposes a secular body In function, it 
ceased to be primarily a clerical seminary, and though it did not lose 
its novices, it became the educational centre of a modern bureau- 
cratic State and a worldwide Imperial polity In putting their classi- 
cal disciplines to this extended use, the dons of Oxford took a great 
deal of pride as the teachers of senators, consuls and proconsuls But 
m reality it was the British Imperial State which made the umversity 
serve it, in the same way as the schools of rhetoric and law in Rome 
and the schools of philosophy in Athens served the Roman Empire. 

Naturally schooling, widened and immensely improved, re- 
mained the mam function of Oxford, and the dominance of the 
colleges and the tutorial system continued Among the students 
the crammers more or less balanced the idlers Despite all that, the 
outstanding feature of the reformed Oxford was not that it became 
a better university, but that it was converted into a very advanced 
public school For its students Greek and Latin meant what they 
did at Eton, Harrow or Rugby, and by an unwritten convention 
sport and games became a part of the academic curriculum As a 
result, they lost their free and personal character, and became or- 
ganized, obligatory, strenuous and honoured disciplines Those 
who regarded boat-racing as being as much a part of Oxford educa- 
tion as were the Greats, did not always recollect, even if they were 
dons instead of undergraduates, how recent this was. Muscular 
Christianity pleached by some Oxford men never became a force 
m English life, but muscular umversity education did 

With this transformation Oxford ceased to be the home of 
dreams and lost causes, and offered a complete contrast to its past by 
becoming a participant in British success and by affiliating itself 



OXFORD— DARK AND BRIGHT 205 

to the imperial greatness of Britain Gladstone, who set the reform- 
ing movement going, did not seem to be wholly satisfied with what 
he had sponsored, and on his deathbed he could only recall the 
Oxford dedicated to the glory of God which he had known in his 
student days Thus to a message sent to him by the Hebdomadal 
Council in 1898 he replied £ There is no expression of Christian 
sympathy that I value more than that of the ancient university of 
Oxford, the God-fearing and God-sustaimng university of Oxford. 
I served her, perhaps mistakenly, but to the best of my ability ’ But 
that Oxford of his was as dead as that of Newman By the end of the 
century Oxford had transferred its allegiance from God to Caesar. 

The imperialistic re-orientation of Oxford quite naturally brought 
into existence a worship and awareness of Oxford education such 
as had not existed before The men who passed out from unre- 
formed Oxford took their association with it for granted, as they 
did their parentage and their ancestral homes But the products of 
reformed Oxford began to look upon themselves as members of a 
corps d’ehte, and acquired a feeling for it which was similar to 
conscious family pride In the normal English Oxonian, this pride 
remained unassertive and reticent, though at times very studiedly so 
and therefore not quite convincing in its modesty But among those 
Englishmen who went out from Oxford to the colonies and depen- 
dencies, and among the White colonials and the Orientals who came 
to Oxford, the cult of Oxford became meretricious, and even dubious 

The worship of Oxford as exported was of a piece with the 
English imperialistic sentiment of the late mneteenth century, which 
was self-conscious, intellectually shoddy, and wholly unworthy of 
the historic phenomenon that the British Empire in its practical 
existence really was Thus it was natural that Cecil Rhodes, the 
most counterfeit of English imperialists, who thought that spec- 
tacular financial success in a colony (and of all places on the Rand), 
gave him a right to patronize the British Empire, should become a 
benefactor of Oxford And the callowness of the imperialism of 
Oxford was shown by its grateful acceptance of his bounty Even 
Oriel accepted it, and allowed Rhodes Gaudens to look down on the 
university church of St Mary the Virgin from his niche in the 
pediment opposite 

But the most baneful impact of imperialistic Oxford was seen 
m the Indians who came there. The English civil servants and 
educationalists in India were mostly from one or other of the two

ancient universities, and they buttressed their prestige there by 
fostering an abject worship of Oxford and Cambridge among 
Indians So the more ambitious and wealthy among them came over 
for their higher education, which was really a pursuit of career and 
prestige, and even with a third-class degree they could ensure both 
If they were clever enough they could make an aegrotat degree do 
as well But they also showed what a femme fatale Oxford or 
Cambridge could be for them 

Max Muller at Oxford saw many of them, and in spite of being a 
champion of India and Indians he has not left a favourable account 
of them As he put it 

The manners of young Indians when they arrive at Oxford are generally 
excellent, but they soon acquire what they consider English manners, 
rough and ready, bluff and blunt, and by no means an improvement 
on their own The same young man who at first enters your room with 
folded hands and a graceful salaam, will after a very short time walk in, 
sit down, stretch out his legs, and address you in the most familiar 
terms They imagine this is English 

He continued 

Even if they pass their examinations, I am afraid that some of them 
return to India not much improved by their English exile The worst 
of it is that they often return desillusionne At first everything English is 
grand and perfect in their eyes, an Oxford degree is the highest goal of 
their ambition But when they have obtained it, chiefly by learning by 
heart, they make very light of it And this making light of it is soon 
applied to other things English also, which they hear constantly criti- 
cized or abused, particularly in the newspapers and parliament, so that 
they often leave England better informed, it may be, but hardly better 
affected towards the Government which they are meant to serve 

^ Max Muller had some understanding of what rankled in the 
mmds of these Indian students It was the absence of personal rela- 
tions with their English fellow-students 

At Oxford [he wrote] they find it very hard to make friends among the 
better class of undergraduates Most of our undergraduates come from 
public schools, and have plenty of friends of their own If they are 
asked to be kind to any of the Indian students, all they can do, or really

be expected to do, is to invite them once or twice to a breakfast party 
They have hardly any interests in common with them, and anything 
like friendship is out of the question 

He continued sadly ‘The present state of things is certainly dis- 
couraging, particularly as it seems impossible to suggest any real 
remedy 5 The Indians themselves made it worse by setting down 
this natural canalization of social intercourse to racial and political 
pride and treating it as conscious apartheid Moreover, they them- 
selves had a sense of guilt They felt keenly that they had come to 
promote their own worldly interests by serving a foreign govern- 
ment, and therefore the more thoroughgoing their interested 
association, the more rancorous was their vicarious disaffection 
Yet the same men, when they went back to India and enjoyed 
their prosperity and prestige, showed an arrogance to their own 
countrymen which was not less than that of the English rulers This 
internal dichotomy almost predetermined that Indians from Oxford 
and Cambridge should be sterile adventurers incapable of exer- 
cising any influence on the life and culture of their own people In 
fact, some of the most brilliant Indian students of Oxford turned 
out to be the worst careerists in their country Even Nehru failed 
to impinge on Indian life and behaviour with his ideas 

Max Muller also had a concept of a possible Imperial role for 
Oxford and Cambridge, but in its combination of vision with 
realism it was in complete contrast to the pretentious and artificial 
idea which lay behind the Rhodes Scholarships He did not believe 
that the peculiarly English traits and outlooks could be imposed on 
aliens simply by giving them an opportunity to pass through the 
two universities In fact, in a letter written to the Duke of Argyll 
when he became Secretary of State for India in 1868, Muller said 

India can never be anglicized, but it can be remvigorated By encourag- 
ing a study of their own ancient literature, as part of their education, a 
national feeling of pride and self-respect will be reawakened among 
those who influence large masses of the people A new national litera- 
ture may spring up, impregnated with Western ideas, yet retaining its 
native spirit and character A new national literature will bring with 
it a new national and a new moral vigour

the nineteenth century in Bengal, but it did not come abouj: by

bringing Indians to Oxford and Cambridge Max Muller’s pre- 
scription was to give the desired education in India by training 
Englishmen at Oxford to play their educational role there effectively 
He saw the fulfilment of British rule in India in this educational 
mission, which was really a task of cultural proselytization He had 
put forward the idea as early as 1856, in a letter written to Bunsen 
m which he said 'After the last annexation the territorial conquest 
of India ceases — what follows next is the struggle in the realm of 
religion and of the spirit, in which, of course, centres the interests 
of the nations ’ He repeated the idea in different words to the Duke 
of Argyll 'India has been conquered once, but India must be con- 
quered again, and that second conquest should be a conquest by 
education ’ 

He added in the same letter that as a result of Western education 
a class of young Indians had already risen in Bengal, who were 
known as Young Bengal and who were ready to play their part in 
this movement of cultural proselytization, because they were the 
'product of English ideas grafted on the native mind’ He informed 
the Duke that Englishmen in India were always finding fault with 
this Young Bengal, but set down his view that in spite of their faults 
they had promise, observing shrewdly that ‘their faults were apparent 
everywhere, but their good qualities were naturally hidden from the 
eyes of careless observers’ Then he gave the example of a young 
Bengali who had just published a book on his travels in Europe, in 
which he said that 'if it was the will of Providence that a nation 
would have a yoke on its neck the yoke of the English was the least 
galling’ Max Muller also quoted to the Duke the words in which 
this young man summed up the achievement of the English people 
m India, and at the same time put his finger on the weak spot of the 
British attitude towards Indians . 

Nothing less than British phlegm, and imperturbability, and constancy, 
and untiring energy could have steadily prosecuted the task of con- 
solidating the disjointed masses of India, and casting her into the 
mould of one compact nation They want but ‘high thoughts seated in 
a heart of courtesy 5 to attach us to their rule, with a feeling of loyalty 
that, not merely playing round the head, should come near to the 
heart 


On this Muller commented . 'A society leavened by such men will 
make it possible for the Government to save hundreds and thou- 



OXFORD— DARK AND BRIGHT 209 

sands in soldiers and policemen, and millions in wars and sup- 
pression of rebellions \* 

Muller had also thought out how the emergence of such a class 
of Indians could be promoted It was that young Englishmen 
should have the kind of education in English universities which 
would make them capable of playing their cultural role by giving 
them on the one hand intellectual competence and knowledge and, 
on the other, sympathy and understanding for the Indian people 
The very first step which had to be taken to realize this purpose was 
to create a school of Indian languages in the universities His long 
campaign to establish such an institution and to introduce the study 
of Oriental languages in England, has been described in the previous 
chapter 

But Max Muller’s concept of a cultural mission in India was 
never taken seriously in England, either in its doctrmal or in its 
practical aspect On the contrary, young Englishmen went to serve 
m India in ignorance of the country and with contempt for the 
people The only corrective to that situation, which was provided 
more by the circumstances than by any conscious perception of the 
problem, was to bring young Indians over to Oxford or Cambridge, 
give them an English veneer, and sterilize them It was an applica- 
tion of the idea which afterwards Rhodes consecrated with his 
money. This was a negation of true imperialism, and it is no wonder 
that the country named after Rhodes and the country where he 
achieved his spectacular success have both become the most unequi- 
vocal symbols of the failure of British imperialism 

However, one must not judge the imperial aspect of reformed 
Oxford by its expression among the colonial British and the Indians 
educated at Oxford and Cambridge. It had a higher and more im- 
posing aspect, as shown by men such as Curzon and Milner who 
were more authentic Oxford men than Rhodes Long before either 
of them Max Muller had found himself wishing that the lure of the 
Indian Civil Service had not brought Indians to Oxford, and that 
they had remained in their own country to serve it as scholars and 
thinkers. 

In spite of all this an Oxford Magna did emerge out of the re- 
forms, between which and the larger political and imperial existence 
of the English people there was a very close nexus Oxford, too, 
became proudly conscious of the relationship In the earlier stages 
of reform the most majestic political personality moulded by

Oxfoid, Gladstone, was hounded out, but with the completion of 
reform the university took pride in noting the fact that in the last 
year of the nineteenth century there were ten Oxford men in a 
Cabinet presided over by its Chancellor 

Along with this however the old Oxford Parva was not only 
allowed to survive, but was even infused with a new vitality Its 
scholarship, speculations and art of living were made more active 
and fervid All activities of the mind were recreations pursued and 
valued more for the sense of self-realization than for the contribution 
they made to knowledge or thought Nowhere was the Latin saying 
Abeunt studia in mores (study fulfils itself in a manner of living) 
better illustrated than in this little Oxford, Oxford Parva sed Apia 
There settled on its grey stones some light from far away Fiesole and 
Sienna The men who represented this Oxford were figures like 
T H Greene, F H Bradley, Walter Pater, to mention only a 
typical few 

The scholarly and speculativ e creations of this Oxford enlivened, 
enriched, and sustained mental life in the outside world, even in- 
cluding India But in its own existence they were only parerga 
aeademica y incidental music at a banquet The value of the educa- 
tion which Oxford gave was frankly recognized by all , but anyone 
who knew anything about scholarship, learning, science and specu- 
lative thought, also knew that love of knowledge for its own sake 
was the last thing fostered by new Oxford among its students On 
this point foreigners, natives and domiciled foreigners were all 
agreed Renan observed that a minor German university with its 
poor and uncouth professors did more for the human spirit than the 
aristocratic university of Oxford with its princely revenues, its 
magnificent buildings, its opulent style of living and its idle fellows 

Pattison, whose one positive passion in life was the pursuit of 
learning and who as reformer had before his eyes the vision of 
Oxfoid as a home of higher research and advanced learning, be- 
came a confirmed misanthrope when reform was at last fully under 
way He did not deny that Oxford efficiently performed its function 
as a great national lycee But this was precisely the Oxford he dis- 
liked and disapproved of To him this function showed a preference 
for the ‘lower states of education of which all men do or can par- 
take’, as against the superior education which a university pro- 
fesses to administer In his exasperated moments he called this 
Oxford a cramming shop

Max Muller, who was associated with the reformers from the 
beginning but would not take any active part in the movement be- 
cause he was a foreigner, very soon became disappointed with the 
outcome of the reforms Even in 1855 he wrote 'Oxford is in a sad 
condition , the reform has done nothing, and we are worse off than 
before Gladstone’s Bill has introduced a complicated and im- 
practical system, which suffocates all proposals for the better . 
What remains therefore is nothing but the coffee-grounds which 
nobody desires to have — clergymen without a parish and scholars 
without scholarship 1 ’ 

Thirteen years later, on October 27, 1S68, he spoke no less em- 
phatically in his inaugural lecture delivered as the new Professor 
of Comparative Philology 

Noblesse oblige [he declared] applies to Oxford at the present moment 
more than ever, when knowledge for its own sake and a chivalrous 
devotion to studies which command no price in the fair of the world, 
and lead to no place of emolument in Church or State, are looked down 
upon and ridiculed by almost everybody 

There is no career in England at the present time for scholars and 
students No father could honestly advise his son, whatever talent he 
might display, to devote himself exclusively to classical, historical, or 
physical studies The few men who still keep up the fair name of 
England by independent research and new discoveries in the fields of 
political and natural history, do not always come from our universities , 
and unless they possess independent means, they cannot devote more 
than their leisure hours, left by their official duties in Church or State, 
to the prosecution of their favourite studies 

This, he declared, neither ought to be nor need be, for if only 
twenty men at Oxford and Cambridge had the will everything was 
ready for reform and the restoration of the ancient glory of Oxford 
In 1878, a writer giving a portrait of Max Muller in Contemporary 
Portraits , New Series, No 10, quoted the passage from his inau- 
gural lecture and explained why it was so, as he saw it 'The reason,’ 
he said, 'that meets these pertinent queries is the shameful one that 
Oxford is of the world and that in the world’s ways the ideally best 
must hide its shamefaced beauty before the power of position, the 
scorn of vested interests, the laziness of the luxurious, the intrigues 
of self-seekers, the worshippers of material prestige .\* 

Strong as this was, it was also the view of the life and aspirations

of the Oxford dons held by the town, which had very little respect 
for the gown As it happened, the university and the colleges were 
themsehes responsible for creating such notions They had refused 
to disclose the facts about their revenues to the Commission of 1850, 
and, as a result, speculation was rife about their hidden and hoarded 
wealth It was the Cleveland Commission of 1872, which, in its 
report published in 1874, for the first time fully revealed the extent 
of the wealth and properties of the university and the colleges, and 
show ed that they were neither as wealthy as many had supposed, 
nor careless as landowners But great landowners they still were, the 
university being the junior partner and the colleges collectively the 
semor The income of the two was classified under six heads 
(1) Lands, (2) house property, (3) tithe rent charges, (4) other rent 
charges, such as free farm rents and fixed charges, (5) stocks, 
shares, and other securities , (6) receipts from fines, tuition, minerals, 
etc Overwhelmingly, the money came from landed property, of 
which the university had 7,684 acres, and the colleges jointly 
184,764 acres The total income of the university was £47,000, of 
wdiich £29,000 came from property The total income of the 
colleges was £363,000, of which £280,000 came from the same 
source 

The authorities of the university and the colleges showed them- 
selves as very competent managers, and never buried their material 
talents Mark Pattison, with all his love of learning and absorption 
m mental life, was not less attentive to the properties of Lincoln 
Jowett, for all his cherubic looks, was an astute business man both 
as master and as Vice-Chancellor Max Muller has left a most illu- 
minating account of the business flair of an Oxford don and clergy- 
man, Dr Bull, Canon and Bursar of Christ Church 

A well-known banker had for years been handling the money of 
Christ Church, and no one suspected him One day, however, 
Dr Bull invited him to dinner, and he was struck by the very pious 
and orthodox remarks the banker made, which he thought suited a 
Canon of Christ Church more than a wealthy and worldly banker 
from London Without saying a word Dr Bull went to London the 
next day, drew out all the money of the college, and the day after, 
to the dismay of all London, the bank failed All the other depositors 
lost their money, but not Christ Church 

But in the pre-reform days, that is, in the days of the Don Logs, 
the scramble was not indecorous, for the distribution of patronage

and preferment was controlled by a fixed procedure and confined 
to an oligarchy without reference to merit But the reforms which 
dragged merit into the question of preferment, at once promoted 
the scramble by bringing into existence a class of pushing Don 
Storks and giving respectability to their monetary ambitions The 
first appearances of the factionalism were seen in the rejection of 
Pattison’s claim to the Rectorship of Lincoln in 1851 and of Jowett’s 
to the Mastership of Balliol in 1854 Max Muller was also to suffer 
from it, as will be related later For a decade or so the tactics for deny- 
ing money to a person not acceptable to the dominating caucus was 
to fasten the odium theologicum on him But as time passed the re- 
ligious or dogmatic narrowness declined, and the scramble became 
a tussle for money pure and simple 

Two men, above everybody else, stood out among the leading 
personalities of the reforming Oxford in the latter half of the nine- 
teenth century, and they represented both its bright and dark sides 
They were, of course, Jowett and Pattison No one living at Oxford 
in those days could be unaware of their overwhelming presence 
Jowett provided its son et lumiere , and Pattison its thunder and 
lightning Moreover no one, judging them contemporaneously or in 
historical retrospect, could deny that they had their unquestionable, 
though particular, greatness and genius But no one could also fail 
to be conscious that both had traits of character which repelled or 
alienated. No theologian to my knowledge has described what the 
fallen angels were like when they had rebelled and been thrown out 
of heaven Jowett and Pattison could give a very good idea of them, 
the first as Belial and the second as Moloch Both showed them- 
selves at Oxford as seraphim who had qualified for hell „ 

It is curious that of the two Pattison should, in the final summing- 
up, turn out to be the better scholar Jowett was the best boy at 
St Paul’s, won the Balliol scholarship, was elected fellow as an 
undergraduate and took a first Pattison, on the contrary, never 
went to school and was taught by his father at home, got a second 
class at Oxford, and after failing to be elected fellow at Oriel, 
University and Balliol, got a Lincoln fellowship as a sort of consola- 
tion prize Yet he could despise Jowett’s scholarship. But Mark 
Pattison’s poor opinion of Jowett’s scholarship was both unfair 
and irrelevant” Scholarship is a matter of temperament Pattison had 
that, while Jowett did not Jowett was essentially and above all a 
pedagogue and a moralist. What Jowett sought to do was to pour 



214 SCHOLAR EXTRAORDINARY 

on to the three mam interests of nineteenth- century Englishmen, 
politics, money and religion, the spikenard of a refurbished Hel- 
lenism, which might be called Victorian neo-Platomsm, but which 
was of course very much more superficial Jowett was called 
‘Master’ by men and women of fashion, and the Master he 
remained 

Pattison could see with perfect clearness where he and Jowett 
differed as to the end of university education ‘The separation be- 
tween Jowett and myself’, he wrote, ‘consists in a difference upon 
the fundamental question of university politics — viz , Science and 
Learning v School keeping ’ 

Pattison’s defects of character were obvious, and therefore clever 
novelists could satirize him easily Swinburne broke out with the 
epigram that Pattison was a ‘morally and spiritually typical and 
unmistakable ape of the Dead Sea’ Jowett’s failings, on the other 
hand, were extremely insidious, and could hardly be perceived by 
outsiders unless they were almost cynically percipient Also, he had 
the intelligence and moderation to utilize them for advancing his 
career rather than letting them damage it He was a flatterer of the 
aristocracy and of people of fashion 

There could be no doubt whatever but that Pattison was the 
greater man He achieved at its highest level the personality of a man 
endowed with great intellectual power and with a demoniac pas- 
sional potential, but without the faculty of positive and disinterested 
love which is the Christian cantas In its default, he was bound to 
arrive at the state of mind which proclaimed itself in an invincible 
repugnance for all action He feared moral and religious enthusiasm, 
for he knew not where it might lead He distrusted religion, and set 
down in his memoirs that ‘religion is a good servant, but a bad 
master’ 

In nothing else was the desiccation of Mark Pattison shown 
more characteristically than in his intense desire for love and his 
failure to get it, with one exception He wanted love, but never 
realized that love cannot be had without loving, without shedding 
all egoism Pattison in everything was an uninhibited egoist, and 
even his affection for Meta Bradley was a projection of his self-love 
flattered by the adoration of a weak woman His wife described her 
horror of his last days in the following words ‘Let not my last days 
be like his \* The moral rum is awful ’ 

Jowett was the opposite He inspired affection and could also show 



OXFORD-DARK AND BRIGHT 215 

affection But the interchange was superficial, for he distrusted 
passion and always employed that word in a bad sense Therefore, 
over his puntamsm, which was both fierce and narrow, he suc- 
ceeded in laying a coat of unctuousness, which made worldlings 
look up to him for moral inspiration and guidance But there was 
also no doubt that his moral sense was fundamentally right His 
intellectual capacity and moral sensitiveness were such that one 
could not easily perceive that he was an adventurer V ery few adven- 
turers in the world have taken an adventurer’s life to a higher level, 
morally and intellectually 

There is one test which is dependable in judging the personality 
of any Oxford man in the latter half of the nineteenth century, and 
that is his attitude to John Henry Newman, the disinherited among 
the great sons of Oxford Jowett and Pattison agreed in substance 
over him, but in a wholly different spirit After reading the life of 
Newman, in 1891 Jowett wrote to Margot Tennant (later Asquith) 

Considering what he really was, it is wonderful what a space he has 
filled in the eyes of mankind In speculation he was habitually untruth- 
ful and not much better in practice His conscience had been taken out, 
and the Church put in its place Yet he was a man of genius, and a 
good man in the sense of bemg disinterested Truth is very often 
troublesome, but neither the world nor the individual can get on with- 
out it 

Mark Pattison also believed, like Jowett, that Newman did not 
care for truth apart from dogma, but he showed no personal dis- 
respect for him He had called Newman 'Master’, and to the end he 
called him that When Pattison was dying, Newman wrote to him 
expressing a wish to see him He at once agreed, though his anti- 
relxgious cynicism attributed a motive to the visit After it was over 
Pattison wrote Tt was not all personal regard, but the hope, how- 
ever slight, that I might still be got over in my last moments ’ 
Though cynical, the comment was not disrespectful to Newman 
personally Newman did have that hope, but it could not be dis- 
honourable in a man of faith to hope to bring back to the fold a 
follower who had strayed from it 

The truth of the matter is that in the unfolding of their careers 
both the men remained true to their origins, commercial and cleri- 
cal Jowett remained throughout the successful businessman, and 

Pattison the unsuccessful cleric

Between them they represented the new Oxford in its personal 
ambitions and in its consciously adopted educational role, though 
one gloated on success and the other almost exulted in failure 
There were, however, two others who kept up the spirit of old 
Oxford through the changing times, here again with contrasted 
results for themselves These men w ere Dr Pusey and Dean Lid- 
dell Pusey died fighting to the last for an Oxford in the service of 
religion Liddell adapted himself to the reformed Oxford very 
successfully, and even helped further reforms, but in spirit he re- 
mained true to old times 

A very mistaken idea of Dr Pusey as an intolerant bigot was 
current among his latter-day contemporaries, and still survives 
Actually, in spite of his failure and indeed owing to that very defeat 
— for at Oxford only defeat could canonize a man to greatness — he 
was the only samt and hero in the Oxford of the late nineteenth 
century He was indeed uncompromising in what he regarded as 
true doctrine and its application To give only one instance of his 
intolerance, which came within Max Muller’s personal knowledge 
he refused to admimster the Holy Communion to Muller because 
he had not been confirmed by a bishop But he also helped Muller 
m his efforts to get the Boden Professorship of Sanskrit, and no one 
canvassed more energetically for him He met the Hindu reformer 
Keshub Chunder Sen, and though they had a long argument, they 
also parted as friends He also had the warmest sympathy for stu- 
dents in every branch of Oriental philology After Pusey’s death in 
1882 Max Muller, who had considered him dangerous in early life, 
paid the most unqualified tribute to his greatness of character in a 
letter to The Times 

In fact, Pusey was a true Christian in the very combination of 
intolerance and understanding. There is no greater misrepresenta- 
tion of Christianity than to call it a religion of strength made perfect 
m weakness The modern conception of Christianity as a religion of 
degenerate compassion which enjoins tolerance for all human fail- 
ings, crimes and perversions, is a grotesque distortion On the 
contrary, Christianity was merciful to the weak because it was so 
strong Pusey was a true Christian in that he condemned himself 
(not merely others) as a sinner 

Pusey’s excessive sense of his own sinfulness may now seem 
horribly unnatural, but Christianity was never a religion for the 
natural man, whom it regarded as unregenerate man living in 



OXFORD— DARK AND BRIGHT 217 

original sin A conviction of sinfulness, however unfounded, was of 
the very essence of Christian faith and morality, and, as the bio- 
graphers of Pusey point out, self-condemnation has come from 
St Augustine, St Francis of Assisi, St Vincent de Paul, John 
Bunyan, St Francois de Sales and John Wesley Pusey only con- 
tinued that tradition It was strange that a man who was really 
angelic should consign himself to hell with only a slender hope that, 
justified by faith alone, he would be allowed to redeem himself 
there, whereas the two fallen angels, Pattison and Jowett, con- 
tinued to strut and bask in the heaven that was Oxford But cer- 
tainly Pusey’s self-torture was preferable to the moral complacence 
of Jowett, purred out to fashionable men and women, who saw in it 
a gilding of their worldly hedonism 

It was in such a setting that Max Muller had to live his life at 
Oxford His reaction was a strange dichotomy of attraction and 
repulsion, as was perhaps unavoidable from the dual nature of 
Oxford The whole relationship can be illustrated by Muller’s 
relations with Jowett, which were symbolic They became friends 
very early, and in all the vicissitudes of Jowett’s career Muller 
sided with him He was on Jowett’s side when the latter brought 
theological troubles on himself, and by that association Muller also 
got into trouble And he expressed himself even more strongly when 
at one stage the proposal to increase Jowett’s salary as Regius 
Professor of Greek fell through 

Yet there rankled in Muller’s mind some sense of grievance 
against Jowett, some dark suspicion of duplicity or disloyalty This 
came to a head early in 1876, at the time of the reconstitution of the 
terms of the Professorship of Comparative Philology Muller sus- 
pected Jowett of sitting on the fence, if not actually opposing the 
proposal After the matter had been settled in Muller’s favour and 
Jowett had supported him strongly, Muller wrote to Stanley that 
though he admitted Jowett had behaved well, he still could not 
quite forgive him He observed T cannot understand him Perhaps 
we make idols of our friends, and if they break we cannot bear it ’ 
There is finally the cool statement about Jowett in Muller’s auto- 
biography, published after his death\* 

Jowett knew quite well, and he did not hesitate to say so, that to do 
much good in this world, you must be a very able and honest man, 
thinking of nothing else day and night; and he adds, ‘You must also be 



218 SCHOLAR EXTRAORDINARY 

a considerable piece of a rogue, having many reticences and conceal- 
ments ’ Now Professor Jowett has certainly done some good work 
at Oxford, but if any one were to say that he also was a considerable 
piece of a rogue, what an outcry there would be among the sons of 
Balliol 

The fact was that Max Muller by nature and upbringing was too 
simple a character to be quite at home at Oxford with all its com- 
plexity and sophistication He was uncomfortable with its subtle 
and often casuistical ethics, and on his part he repelled the more 
typically Oxford characters Mark Pattison, without knowing him 
intimately, gave the following psychological explanation of the 
failure of Muller to get the Boden Professorship Tt was due/ he 
said, 'first and chiefly, to his own unpopular manners and to the 
experience his own friends (including myself among the number) 
have had of his inability for real attachment We all knew that he 
only valued us so far as we could be of use to him 9 

For Pattison to say that of Muller was almost scandalous Muller 
never came to know of Pattison’s opinion, but he knew his man He 
looked upon Pattison as the best-read man at Oxford, and added. 
'Anywhere but at Oxford he would have grown into a Lessmg ’ 
None the less he also wrote to Bunsen 'Pattison is as reserved as 
ever, and trusts no one 5 

Moreover, on account of his German-trained mmd he yearned 
for a kind of intellectual communication at Oxford which its society 
regarded as ‘shop-talk’ Even at the age of forty-three Max Muller 
showed a metaphysical proclivity which Oxford, with all its Hegeli- 
zation, had no taste for Thus in 1867 Muller was complaining to 
Professor Bernays\* 

What I miss most here in Oxford is stimulating intercourse in literary 
and scientific circles That is entirely wanting, especially in my special 
branch of study Altogether the Englishman seems to me to have no 
interest for the ‘becoming' or ‘growing 5 , it is all to be tangible and 
ready-made All dialectic is wanting in the true sense of the word 
However, there are deep shadows everywhere, and I do not want to 
forget the bnght sides of English life, and I am afraid that I should 
find it somewhat difficult to get accustomed again to the rather narrow 
German trousers 


He was however very grateful to Oxford, and added in the same 



OXFORD— DARK AND BRIGHT 219 

letter that ‘here in Oxford, I must say, everything is done to make 
up for what has been done amiss’ 

Max Muller decided to solve the social problem of remaining at 
Oxford by following St Paul’s dictum about the world Thou shalt 
be in it, but not of it He tried to keep aloof from the incessant 
movement of wheels within wheels at Oxford for monetary and 
other worldly advantages Nor would he join the reforming move- 
ment actively, because he felt that his open participation in it 
would do harm because he was a foreigner, and of all foreigners a 
German For this he suffered personally However, 1 emaimng depen- 
dent on the academic community of Oxford for money and position 
he could not hope to be entirely free of its intrigues, rivalries, anti- 
pathies and partisanships 

It is Muller’s involvement in the life that was the most typically 
Oxonian of all Oxford life which now has to be described It has 
already been seen how the delay in appointing him to the Taylorian 
Professorship had irked him But this post was not a university 
preferment, and in any case the appointment of a European as a 
lecturer on European languages was not likely to be resented So 
Max Muller had the Professorship easily The Greek language, 
however, was looked upon as a special prerogative of the Oxford 
dons After Liddell came to Christ Church as Dean in 1855, 
Muller discussed with him the Greek lexicon, the famous Liddell 
and Scott, and observed that, good as the dictionary was, its etymo- 
logies were mostly inaccurate Though Liddell was no student of 
comparative philology, he was broadminded enough to ask Muller 
to undertake the task of revising them All seemed settled between 
the two, when one day the Dean came to him, shrugged his shoul- 
ders, and said that the proposal had to be given up He did not 
explain the reason, though evidently he was very displeased 

It was only in 1898, two years before his death, that Muller 
learned from an anonymous review that Scott was the man who had 
obstructed the proposal for revision Even then Max Muller would 
not believe it, because in his early years at Oxford Scott has shown 
great kindness and courtesy to him He had heard also that Scott 
was associated with those who were against him in connexion with 
the Boden Professorship But it is quite possible that Scott had lost 
all friendly feeling for Muller because he was a friend of Jowett, to 
whom Scott had been preferred as Master of Balliol Privately, Max 
Muller held a poor opinion of Scott, and in 1870 he wrote to his 



220 SCHOLAR EXTRAORDINARY 

wife T consider Scott as a thoroughly dishonest man, and yet he is 
respected by many people Who knows who is right ^ 

The next step in the advancement of Max Muller at Oxford was, 
however, a most gratifying experience for him In 1858 he was 
elected a Fellow of All Souls, an unprecedented honour for a 
foreigner at that time This was done at the instance of Henry Coxe, 
Librarian of the Bodleian and known as Bodley Coxe Coxe enter- 
tained a very warm friendship for Muller and, realizing that the 
status and home offered by the college would be a great help to him, 
discussed it with another friend, Sir Robert Herbert, and they 
joined in pressing upon the Fellows of All Souls the advisability of 
electing him under the special powers conferred by the Act of 1854 
This was done, and Muller’s delight knew no bounds 

A writer, after his death recalling Muller’s life at Oxford, observed 
that he never ceased to find an exquisite kind of amusement in his 
own position as a Fellow of All Souls Tor him, the self-devoted 
Stuhengelehrte , the youth of austere training and unworldly ideals, 
to have drifted into that fat paradise of the voluptuaries of learning 
struck him as a delightful joke on the part of Fate, and one which he 
frankly enjoyed seeing appreciated by others 5 To his mother 
Muller wrote 'The bells have been rung again for me in Oxford, 
for I have, quite unexpectedly, received a fellowship in All Souls 
College I had no idea of it, and the thing has excited great sur- 
prise. A fortnight ago I was asked if I should have any objection if 
I were elected, and the next day I was elected Why they elected me 
I have no idea, it is a great distinction 5 

This unsolicited distinction and kindness evoked a sneaking 
kindness in Max Muller for the old unreformed All Souls which 
elected its Fellows as if they were members of a social club But he 
himself was elected under the new Ordinance which required that 
the Fellows should be chosen according to their merits. 

At all events, he showed very little of the don as a new Fellow 
At the annual Gaudy on All Souls 5 Day he would become the 
German student again, and join with the somewhat tumultuous 
merriment of the younger fellows, and be induced to sing Gaudeamus 
tgitur 

Max Muller’s next attempt to secure a higher income and position 
at Oxford, by obtaining the Boden Professorship of Sanskrit, ended 
in a complete failure This was a decisive turning point in his 
scholarly and intellectual life, and for this reason the episode has to

OXFORD— DARK AND BRIGHT 

be narrated fully But the story also illustrates the dark and bright 
Oxford which had become the setting of his life The election to 
this Professorship of Momer Williams instead of Max Muller in 
December i860 was an incident in the long struggle between the 
academic reformers and conservatives, in which the latter, after being 
defeated over the wider question of remodelling the university, won 
a startling incidental victory 

The Professorship was endowed by Lieut- Colonel Joseph Boden 
of the East India Company’s service, who had retired in 1807 and 
died in 1 81 1 He bequeathed all his property, valued roundly at 
.£25,000, ultimately to Oxford to found a Professorship of the 
Sanskrit Language, 'being of opinion that a more general knowledge 
and critical knowledge of the Sanskrit language will be a means of 
enabling his countrymen to proceed in the conversion of the 
Natives of India to the Christian Religion, by disseminating a 
knowledge of the sacred scriptures amongst them, more effectually 
than all other means whatever’ 

The legacy came finally to Oxford at the death of Boden’s 
daughter at the age of mneteen, and after some litigation In 1832 
one of the distinguished early English Sanskritists, Horace Hayman 
Wilson, was appointed to the post As its salary was between £goo 
to £1,000 a year and as it was tenable for life, it was looked upon as a 
very lucrative living at the disposal of the university Certainly 
competition for it would have been much more severe if it had not 
been reserved for a scholar in Sanskrit Thus it happened that over 
about a century the post had only three incumbents Wilson from 
1832 to i860, Momer Williams from i860 to 1899, and Macdonnel 
from 1899 to 1927 Appointment to it was in the hands of the Con- 
vocation, which was to choose the candidate most fitted in its 
judgement to fulfil the post In January 1861 the Convocation had 
3,786 members Thus the election to the Professorship had the 
character of a parliamentary election, and the candidates followed 
the same methods in contesting for the post 

Wilson died on May 8, i860, and the notice of an election to be 
‘holden 5 on December 7 next was issued on May 16 Max Muller 
immediately sent in his application with numerous testimonials, 
and so did Momer Williams Among those who recommended 
Muller were all the noted Orientalists of Europe of the age, digni- 
taries like the Bishop of Calcutta and Raja Radha r anta Deb in 
India, and many leading English ecclesiastical figures, including 



222 SCHOLAR EXTRAORDINARY 

Pusey, Keble, Church and Stanley The supporters of Momer 
Williams equalled in number those of Muller, and included many 
Bengali pundits, but they were not so distinguished For six months 
and more a vigorous election campaign was carried on, with mani- 
festoes, handbills, letters to newspapers and, above all, personal 
canvassing by means of letters and word of mouth Muller had his 
committee, and Momer Williams had two, one at Oxford and the 
other in London In less than a month Muller was sick of the 
business 

There is no doubt that, in a more or less conscious way, Max 
Muller had had his eyes on this post as the culmination of his 
career at Oxford and also as a secure means of pursuing his vocation 
of studying Sanskrit In any case, his friends and fellow-scholars 
had always expected that it would come to him in time 

Before the election took place a supporter of Muller wrote to The 
Times that the difference between the two candidates was the 
'difference between respectable and honourable proficiency, and 
the complete and masterful knowledge of the subject possessed by 
a rare genius and profound scholar, from whose authority on the 
subjects of Indian philology and philosophy there was no appeal in 
Europe 5 This was perfectly true in the light of contemporary repu- 
tation A French Sanskritist kept on declaring, in spite of what 
others were saying, that Muller’s defeat was impossible 

But all this was irrelevant to the question of Muller’s election, 
which was to be swayed by a different consideration — the intention 
of the Founder The paradoxical aspect of the matter was that after 
the rejection of the intentions of the Founders in respect of the 
working of the whole university, the Convocation was being asked 
to respect the intention of a Founder in regard to one Professorship 
The question was thoroughly discussed During the election cam- 
pam both Max Muller and Momer Williams circulated manifestoes 
explaining their respective views on the nature of the Professorship 

Of these, Muller’s was the first and was dated September 3, i860 
He said that if elected it would be his most obvious duty to give 
practical and daily teaching to those who wanted to learn or study 
Sanskrit, but he also pointed out that this alone would be ‘but a 
mean return for the liberality of the Founder of the Chair of San- 
skrit’ He added that a Professor of Sanskrit at Oxford ought to 
lecture on (1) the history and literature of India; (2) the religion and 
philosophy of the Hindus, and (3) Comparative Philology He 



OXFORD— DARK AND BRIGHT 223 

thought that the Boden Professor should create a school of Sanskrit 
Scholarship and Comparative Philology at Oxford 
On the basis of such a definition of the functions of the Professor- 
ship, Momer Williams was ready to concede Muller’s superior 
claim unreservedly But was the definition right ? Williams began 
by saying that before applying for the post he had taken the first 
step of ascertaining what the requirements were for the Professor- 
ship in the exact words of the Founder, and he declared 

Had I found plain instructions that the electors of the University were 
to search throughout Europe for the man most likely to secure a world- 
wide reputation for the Sanskrit Chair, I confess that I should have 
hesitated to prosecute my design But Colonel Boden thought more of 
aiding, by means of Sanskrit, the diffusion of Christianity in India than 
of promoting in all parts of the globe the fame of the Professorship 
The establishment of a school of European comparative philology and 
Indian history, mythology, and philosophy, would doubtless be attrac- 
tive, but such a departure from the one object of the Founder and 
strict province of the Professorship would not, in my opinion, be 
justifiable 

Then he went on to give an analysis of the contents and character 
of Sanskrit literature in order to show which branch of it was most 
important from the Founder’s point of view, and if in so doing he 
also showed that Max Muller’s special studies were irrelevant he 
was not to be blamed, for in what he said he was right 

Williams pointed out that Sanskrit literature could be classified 
under three distinct periods and categories Of these the most 
ancient and the first was the Vedic literature, the second was made 
up of the six systems of Hindu philosophy and the entire collection 
of philosophical writings, and the third comprised the mass of the 
later literature, including the epics, secular poetry and prose, and 
sacred law The Vedic literature, he observed, was not the sacred 
writings used and studied by the contemporary Hindus, and did not 
constitute their scriptures in the sense that the Bible and the Koran 
were Christian and Muslim scriptures. Thus the Rig-Veda (Max 
Muller’s speciality) — which, Williams said, was bemg published at 
an expenditure of time, labour, money and erudition far greater 
than was ever bestowed on any edition of the Bible — was ‘a curious 
monument of a bygone worship, at which the missionary, more 
usefully engaged in studying the present condition of the Hindu 

mind, would content himself with a rapid glance.’

The second class of books, the philosophical texts which Momer 
Williams did not know as well as Max Muller, were according to 
Williams writings of a very abstruse and mystical nature, which 
very few learned natives understood, and which a missionary needed 
to know nothing about beyond their leading principles 

In contrast, it was the third class of Sanskrit books (of which he 
had better knowledge than Muller and on which he had done more 
work), which were the real Sanskrit scriptures, which every mission- 
ary must study if he wished to understand the natives of India and 
be understood by them Moreover, classical Sanskrit, in which these 
books were written and to which Momer Williams had devoted his 
linguistic studies, 'really lived and breathed in the current speech 
of the people’, though nominally dead So, if the missionary had to 
translate the Christian scriptures into the modern Indian languages, 
it was this classical Sanskrit which they had to know, and not Vedic 
Sanskrit, on which Max Muller was the leading authority of the age 
Finally, Momer Williams pointed out, Max Muller’s Sanskrit 
scholarship was of the Continental type, and not attractive to the 
English mmd He had felt that until the study of Sanskrit was in a 
manner anglicized, it would always be nauseous to the English 
palate 'Englishmen, 5 he explained, 'are too practical to study a 
language very philosophically 5 All these arguments, besides being 
patriotic, were also legitimate from the standpoint of the Boden 
Professorship as envisaged by Boden, a pious Colonel of the Indian 
Army. 

If the contest between Max Muller and Momer Williams were 
confined to the airing of antithetical conceptions of the Professor- 
ship, it would have been a sharp academic competition, but not an 
election campaign of the parliamentary type, which is what it be- 
came From the beginning all the spices which make the curry that 
is a parliamentary election were put in it At the end of the cam- 
paign even the ideology of the Professorship was highly emotional- 
ized, and the religious stake involved was explained to the electors

There are Two Candidates, with ample Testimonials

At once Max Muller’s supporters issued a counterblast in almost 
the same words, but with tell-tale modifications, such as ‘By 
general consent one is pronounced a Scholar of world-wide reputa- 
tion, the other a Scholar well known to his Friends and Pupils \* 

But even from the missionary point of view, both Dr Pusey and 
the Bishop of Calcutta wrote in favour of Muller Pusey informed 
Muller that at the time of the first appointment to the Professorship 
m 1832 the question of giving a direct missionary turn to the 
appointment had arisen, and as a voter he had then given weight to 
it On the final notices of the election which he forwarded, he wrote 
m his own hand. ‘Max Muller has already done more for the

be more fitting in my opinion for a great Christian University to 
place in its Sanskrit Chair the scholar who has made the Sanskrit 
scriptures accessible to the Christian missionary’ He gave leave to 
Muller to use his letter in any way he considered fit 
After the question of the intention of the Founder, there also 
arose the question of the wishes of the previous holder of the Pro- 
fessorship, as if the principle of apostolic succession was involved in 
the appointment Momer Williams had no difficulty in producing 
decisive proof of his testamentary right With his application he 
submitted the following letter written by Wilson shortly before 
his death 

14 Upper Wimpole Street, April 21, i860 

My dear Williams, I am quite incompetent to give you any hints for 
your industry, for I have been and am suffering dreadfully I am about 
to undergo an operation, and, as there is always a certain amount of 
risk in such an operation at my age, I recommend your being alive to 
the chance of a vacancy I always have looked to you as my successor, 
but you will have a formidable competitor in M Muller, not only for 
his celebrity, but personal influence However, if God be pleased, I 
may get over the trial, and for a few years more keep you in expectancy 
Yours ever affectionately, 

H H Wilson 

Though this was explicit, a friend of Max Muller’s, W S W. 
Vaux of the British Museum, at once raised the question whether 
Wilson could have meant what he said Vaux wrote 

My dear Muller, I was a little surpnsed to read among Williams’s 
testimonials the short note from our late fnend, in which he states 
that he had always looked forward to his succeeding him in the Boden 
Professorship, whenever he should make a vacancy On many occasions 
— and especially on the last time (about two months since, in the East 
India House Library) when I had the pleasure of seeing h im — he 
stated that, in his judgement, you were the first Sansknt scholar in 
Europe I remarked that I was glad to hear him give so decided an 
opinion, as I and several others were naturally anxious that his suc- 
cessor at Oxford should be the fittest man we could procure To this 
he said, ‘You will be quite right if your choice should fall on Max 
Muller ’ 

But on balance it appeared that Wilson was for Williams Even 
as far back as 1830 Wilson had expressed his low opinion of German 
Sanskrit scholars and provoked a controversy with A W Schlegel. 



OXFORD— DARK AND BRIGHT 227 

The campaign also made full use of personal arguments in the 
manner of parliamentary elections, and in respect of them Muller 
was an easier target than Williams He was accused of intending to 
hold two professorships (the Taylonan and the Boden) at the same 
time , of not being an Englishman , of not being able to write English 
well, and of being irreligious To one of these alone he pleaded 
guilty, ‘that of not having been born in England, and having no 
right to the name of an Englishman’ But he added, ‘If, however, 
residence and work in the University give a right to the name of 
Oxfordman, I may, without presumption, be thought to have 
acquired some claim to that title ’ All the other charges he rejected 
totally, and especially the charge of being irreligious 

As to his English, a friend (who remained unknown) wrote to 
The Times ‘Mr Max Muller’s English is perfect Many who have 
not heard the wonderful force and clearness of his public lectures 
must have read, without knowing it, some of his many contributions 
to periodical literature ’ 

At the very height of the campaign Muller was accused of mis- 
representing Williams in his reply in The Times to the latter’s 
manifesto by misquoting ‘some of his statements in a manner preju- 
dicial to his interests’ Max Muller, who was very sensitive to any 
charge of dishonesty, immediately submitted the matter to four 
distinguished members of the university, who reported as follows. 

We the undersigned, having examined Mr Momer Williams’s Circu- 
lar of October 12, and Mr Max Muller’s Letter of October 23, beg 
leave to state that we consider the charge brought against Mr Max 
Muller, in Mr Momer Williams’s Circular just issued, of having ‘mis- 
quoted’ Mr Momer Williams in a manner prejudicial to his interests, 
to be wholly unfounded 

William Thomson, Provost of Queen’s, 

E B Pusey, Regius Professor of Hebrew, 

William Jacobson, Regius Professor of Divinity, 
Mountague Bernard, Chichele Professor of 
International Law and Diplomacy 

But the game was not all one-sided, and at some moments 
Williams too must have felt both awkward and stung 

There was for instance an attack on Momer Williams on the 
score of his incompetence on the external side of Sanskrit scholar- 
ship It was put about that he could not read a Sanskrit manuscript 



228 SCHOLAR EXTRAORDINARY 

To dispro\e that some evidence was produced, and to this Max 
Muller’s supporters replied as follows 

The extracts given by the Master of University and Mr Medd merely 
prove that Mr Williams is able to recognize the letters of a Sanskrit 
MS when he can compare it with an existing text This is a kind of 
mechanical labour which is paid for at the public libraries at Pans and 
Berlin at the rate of half-a-crown an hour Mr Williams has yet to prove 
that he can take a Sanskrit author existing in MS only and give him to 
the world for the first time 

From Williams’s side a complaint came that some of Muller’s 
supporters had improved on this charge in one of the circulars by 
putting this comment on a circular 'The eyes of Europe are on our 
election Shall we elect a man who is great as a Sanskrit scholar, 
philologist, and teacher, or one who cannot read a Sanskrit MS 
It was in this atmosphere of hustings that the election for the 
Professorship was held on December 7, i860 The voting was 833 
for Momer Williams and 610 for Max Muller The defeat was a 
severe disappointment to Muller and his friends, and they all held 
that the scales were tipped against him on irrelevant personal, 
religious and political grounds Muller himself wrote to his mother 
‘The opposite party made it a political and religious question, and 
nothing could be done against them All the best people voted for 
me, the Professors almost unanimously, but the vulgus profanum 
made the majority ’ His father-in-law expressed himself very 
strongly ‘I know not when I have felt more deeply for the trials of 
others or had more reason to admire patience and resignation to 
God’s will than in the spirit you have shown, in what I know to be 
a most severe trial and bitter disappointment But now that all is 
over, and I have time to think, I am inclined to believe that with 
such unscrupulous opponents we could not have won ’ 

But the noblest comfort for him came from Stanley 

I have never experienced [he wrote] the peculiar trial under which you 
are suffering, but I believe, from my own bitter disappomtment on 
your behalf, I can feel what it is for you You will have many consola- 
tions, I need not dwell upon them But you must also give us the best 
consolation that we can have, and that is the assurance that we have not 
been mistaken in the high expectations we had formed of you You 
can still show that, although not Boden Professor, you are and will

remain the oracle of all who wish to know 7 the secrets of Indian litera- 
ture and religion 

Stanley, through sheer spiritual sympathy, had already anticipated 
the course Muller’s intellectual efforts were to take 

After Max Muller’s death two friends wrote to his wife explaining 
the reason for his failure to get the Professorship One of them was 
Canon Farrar, who was a member of his committee Fie said that he 
was inclined to think that the opposition to him was not strictly 
religious or political, but it sprang from 'the Englishman’s dislike 
to an adopted son’ He added that Muller did 'not realize the stub- 
born fixedness of English and Oxford preference for an old Oxford 
man’ But the other informant, W B Gamlen, told Mrs Max 
Muller that on the strength of the version of the affair given to him 
by 'Tommy’ Sheppard of Exeter, who was one of the leaders of the 
Oxford Tories, the verdict was entirely political As he put it T 
should judge that the same opposition would have been offered to 
any candidate, whether an Englishman or foreigner, who could have 
been identified with the liberal, or Gladstoman party ’ 

There can be no doubt that both personal and public reasons lay 
behind Max Muller’s defeat 

His next move to have a share in the flesh-pots of Oxford suc- 
ceeded, though not without some characteristically Oxonian oppo- 
sition In October 1865 Max Muller applied for the post of the 
Oriental Sub-Librarian at the Bodleian, finding that his friend 
Coxe, who was the Librarian, could not secure the services of any 
other Orientalist With the unammous consent of the curators his 
name was forwarded for consideration by the Convocation, and the 
date of the election was announced At once letters began to appear 
m the press against him and for another aspirant 

A formal contradiction to some of the statements made was 
issued by Coxe himself as the Bodleian’s Librarian He asserted 
that 'it may be as well to correct three mis-statements which appear 
m the first of the letters now under circulation Professor Muller’s 
salary as Taylonan Professor is -£500, not "more than j£6oo” He has 
resigned the Exammership for the Indian Civil Service. His labours 
m editing the Vedas , so far from being "well paid”, entail on him a 
considerable pecumary sacrifice ’ 

However, this time Muller was elected, and he enjoyed the work 
very much. But the double work proved too much for his health,

and he resigned the sub-librarianship after about a year and a half, 
In 1868 the university on its own initiative recognized the merits of 
Max Muller in a striking manner It abolished the Taylonan Pro- 
fessorship of Modem European Languages, and created in its place 
expressly for him a new chair of Comparative Philology on a higher 
salary This was the first professorship created by the university 
itself All the previous professorships were established either by 
royal benefactions or private endowments This relieved Muller of 
the duty of lecturing on the European languages, and left him free 
to pursue his own subject 

For the next eight years Max Muller’s life and career at Oxford 
ran smoothly But at the end of 1875 he himself raised a storm about 
his career at Oxford, and on December 1 sent in his resignation of 
the Professorship of Comparative Philology to the Vice-Chancellor 
At the same time he also printed the letter of resignation in a cir- 
cular, and distributed it so that his friends, both inside and outside 
the umversity, might know why after long consideration he had 
taken the step His mam and declared reason was that he wanted 
leisure to pursue his Indian and Sanskritic studies In his letter of 
resignation he said that he had to choose between Sanskrit and Com- 
parative Philology, and he repeated that explanation in a personal 
letter to the Duke of Albany, one of Queen Victoria’s sons 

If I had continued to discharge my duties as Professor of Comparative 
Philology, I should have had to surrender my Sanskrit studies alto- 
gether Were I Professor of Sanskrit at Oxford, nothing would have 
drawn me away from this, in many respects, delightful place , but in 
order to concentrate my powers, and to do something at least before it 
is too late, I see no choice but to give up my pleasant position here, and 
retire to some quiet town in Germany 

None of his friends questioned the reasonableness of his decision 
on this ground, though all of them regretted it 
As soon as the news spread, letters began to pour in from all parts 
of the world, and even from India 

There was no doubt that Muller was sincere in giving this reason 
for his resignation But there was much more behind it than was 
publicly stated For some years he had been feeling a very strong 
emotional revulsion from Oxford, and for a few months before he 
had actually decided to leave it he had written quite frankly to his 



OXFORD— DARK AND BRIGHT 231 

intimate friends about his dissatisfaction For instance, on August 
22 he wrote to Stanley 

I think my time in England is nearly up I doubt whether I ought to 
stay longer I am only tolerated at Oxford, allowed to help when I am 
wanted, but never helped myself when I want help If I had worked 
m Germany as I have worked for twenty-frve years in England, my 
position would be very different Here I am nobody in the University, 
and when I see how I am treated, I really feel sometimes ashamed of 
myself, not for my own, but for my wife’s sake 

He felt he was at Oxford only on sufferance That this mood 
was also’ behind his resignation he admitted to his friend George 
von Bunsen, son of his old patron and helper, in a letter written in 
January 1876, in which he said ‘I will tell you viva voce why I 
have finally made up my mind to leave Oxford Clerical intrigues 
and petty jealousies, alas\* were partly the reason ’ 

Even this was not the whole story What brought his sense of 
grievance against Oxford to a head and finally induced him to act 
was a particular personal matter — the decision of the Hebdomeda! 
Council to put up the name of Momer Williams to the Convocation 
for the honorary degree of d c l This was the only time in his whole 
career that Max Muller acted from personal pique, which showed 
that though intellectually he had outgrown his disappointment over 
the Boden Professorship, it still rankled in his mmd emotionally 
The decision to give the degree to Momer Williams was in itself 
an exhibition of the mores of academic Oxford Towards the end of 
the summer term of 1875 the friends of Williams in the Council 
applied to it to propose a decree which would enable him to have 
the formal degree of dcl without passing the examination for it 
The Council agreed and put forward a draft decree of exoneration 
As soon as it was published in the University Gazette the Uni- 
versity Professor of Law made a solemn remonstrance that such a 
step would overthrow the whole fabric of legal studies which had 
been laboriously erected and by which an Oxford degree in law had 
been recognized by the Inns of Court If, he said, this degree was 
now conferred without an examination on a person ignorant of law 
the university would stultify itself But this argument, the Law 
Faculty added, did not apply to an honorary dcl, because it was 
well known that the honour was conferred annually on all sorts of 
persons and implied no legal qualifications in the recipient 



232 SCHOLAR EXTRAORDINARY 

The Council admitted the force of the argument and cancelled 
the session of the Convocation Williams's friends at once declared 
that this v ould be regarded as a stigma on him, for all the world had 
come to know that a degree was intended, and they even said that 
the stigma would be out of all proportion to the distinction which 
the degree would have given him Then the Council decided to 
propose the honorary degree of dcl, and proceeded with the 
matter This was regarded as a personal slight by Max Muller, 
and at the beginning of November he told his friends that he was 
going to resign 

At this juncture his friends to a man showed themselves to be 
his real friends All of them disapproved of his decision, though 
they were ready to consider his other and mam motive, securing 
greater leisure for his work His brother-in-law Walrond wrote 
strongly to him T don't think you have any idea what a bad effect 
it would have For one man who would give you credit for indigna- 
tion in a sacred cause, the cause of real learmng against the shallow 
pretence of it, a hundred would accuse you of petty personal 
jealousy And what a triumph your enemies will have then 1 ' 
Stanley wrote Tf you have on general grounds determined that 
you ought to pass your remaining years (and, oh\* may they be 
many!) in Germany, much as I shall regret it I shall have nothing 
to say against it But that you should leave Oxford on the ground 
that an undeserved honour has been bestowed on Momer Williams 
seems to be both insufficient in itself and unjust to yourself 9 Dean 
Liddell, as soon as he heard about Max Muller's intention from 
Rolleston, wrote to him\* 

It grieves me much to hear you say that in M really contemplates 
resignation It appears to me that he, at once, greatly overrates the 
importance of the thing itself and greatly underrates his own position 
and character . . I am as sure that it will not occur to anyone 
that any slur will be cast on in M because the Council has rashly and 
undeservedly lavished an empty honour on in W MM stands far too 
high If, on the other hand, he should resign, I know my country- 
men well enough to feel sure that he will be generally blamed and that 
his conduct will be set down to petulance You and I would feel 
too much interested in him not to dread this for his sake and to wish it 
averted, if averted it can be 

A few days later Liddell wrote to Muller himself in the same 



OXFORD— DARK AND BRIGHT 233 

vein, and urged him to put off the resignation even if it were on 
general grounds Other friends also wrote to him All this showed 
that Muller’s fancy that he was only tolerated at Oxford was due to 
his own temperament which created these passing fits of impatience 
Anyhow, when he did resign on the general ground of work, they 
all set about doing something for him which would enable him to 
pursue his vocation without being encumbered by the duties of 
the Professorship The idea was to relieve him of the burden of 
lecturing on Comparative Philology by giving him a Deputy who 
would do that work, and to give him the status of a Professor 
Emeritus Even Lord Salisbury, as Secretary of State for India, took 
up the matter, and on January 27 Liddell wrote to Muller T have 
just received a “private” letter from Lord Salisbury, in which he 
expresses a warm desire on the part both of himself and of the India 
Council that you may be induced to remain at Oxford and in which 
he says that there “seems to be no objection in principle to the India 
Council co-operating with the University to incur the cost of pub- 
lishing the ‘Indian Works’ which are mentioned in your list” ’ He 
also informed Muller that on Monday next he hoped to bring for- 
ward a proposal which might not be unsatisfactory to him This 
proposal was put into the form of a decree to be approved by the 
Convocation on February 15 and circulated by the Vice-Chancellor 
on January 31, 1876 It ran as follows 

Whereas it is expedient to allow Professor in Muller to devote himself 
without interruption to the studies on the Ancient Literature of India 
which he has hitherto prosecuted with so much success and with so 
much honour to the University; In a CONVOCATION to be 
holden on Tuesday, February 15, at Two o’clock, the following form 
of Decree will be submitted to the House — ‘That the provisions of 
Statt Tit IV, Sect 1, 37, cl 3 be suspended, and that the Electors 
proceed to the nomination of A Deputy to be approved by the Vice- 
Chancellor, and the Deputy shall receive one half of the salary of the 
present Professor 5 

Even so the author of Alice in Wonderland brought into play 
against the proposal the devastating logic exhibited in his fantasy 
He said that the deputy would be the real professor, and the retiring 
Professor would really get a pension, that the two were wholly 
independent questions , that the university should be able to provide 
the pension without mulcting the real professor of half of his 



234 SCHOLAR EXTRAORDINARY 

income All this, he said, he was writing in the interest of the un- 
known future holder of the Chair, though also in the interest of 
Max Muller, ‘for surely the very proposal to invite the new Pro- 
fessor to do the work for half the present salary, is to say, by impli- 
cation, that the work has been hitherto overpaid — against which 
suspicion I, for one, desire to record my protest’ 

But the Convocation found the logic — sound as it was — unper- 
suasive, and the decree was carried, Jowett spoke in favour of it, 
and Liddell made a reasoned appeal in a long speech, with an 
eloquent peroration 

Other Governments have acknowledged Professor Max Muller’s great 
achievements, the French Institute several 3^ ears ago elected him a 
Foreign Member, the Royal Academy of Turin paid him the same 
honour, and made him one of a distinguished six, the others being 
Cousin, Thiers, Bockh, Mommsen, and Grote He received the Cross 
of the Order of Merit from the German Emperor two years ago, along 
with von Moltke England has been behindhand Let Oxford by a 
unanimous vote today do something to repair this backwardness , not 
for his sake, but for our own, I ask it Let us keep him if we can, how 
we can, while we can 

Max Muller was informed of the decision and wrote to the Vice- 
Chancellor in the most grateful terms, saying that he looked for- 
ward with great satisfaction to spending the remaimng years of his 
life at Oxford \* 

On hearing of it Froude wrote gladly. ‘My dear Max, 

Two words only to express my hearty delight that all is well 
settled and that we are to be spared the dishonour of losing you 9 
And just as Mohere said that la comedie ftmt par un petit ballet 
qm avoit ete prepare, the University Musical Club sent Max Muller 
the following invitation and message 

The President ventures to invite Professor Max Muller’s attention to 
this evening’s programme, and to express to him the very great 
pleasure it would give the Club if he were able to be present this
