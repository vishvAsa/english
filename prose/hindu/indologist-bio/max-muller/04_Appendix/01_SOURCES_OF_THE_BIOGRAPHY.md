Appendix I 

SOURCES OF THE BIOGRAPHY 

(Citations from Max Muller’s writings and correspondence are in his own 
English, except when a book or a letter is in German The lists in this and 
Appendix II specify which are in that language The languages of his non- 
British correspondents [except Indians, who wrote in English] were their 
own All citations from any source in German are given in Mrs Max 
Muller’s translation ) 

Pnnted Sources 

1 Max Muller’s recollections of European and Indian personalities 
published under the title Auld Lang Syne I and II, in 1898 and 1899 

2 His autobiography written in fragments in his last years, and revised 
with the help of his son during the last months of his life, down to 
October 19, 1 e , nine days before his death Published posthumously
