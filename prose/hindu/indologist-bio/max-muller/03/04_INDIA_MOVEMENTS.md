INDIA MOVEMENTS 

It has been seen that all the scholarly researches of Max Muller 
had a practical side, or in any case practical implications For in- 
stance, in editing the Rig-Veda he always kept in mind the effect its 
publication might have on the religious life of contemporary Hindus 
He had the same end in view when, after completing his edition of 
the book, he took up the editorship of a gigantic corpus of the 
scriptures of the East under the general title of The Sacred Books of 
the East In addition, he kept himself in touch with all the important 
religious and social movements in India even when they were not 
directly connected with his scholarly work, and tried to promote 
those which he considered progressive In thus involving himself 
m the sphere of action from a distance he certainly produced results 
which were more tangible than those which Plato could bring about 
either at Athens or Syracuse 

But the deepest and most enduring practical effect of his scholarly 
effort was produced by that part of it which for him was the most 
theoretical His work on Comparative Philology had its political 
effect, and gave a specific direction and character to modern Indian 
nationalism 

The contribution made by the European Orientalists to Indian 
nationalism is now recognized by all The Hindus had created their 
own brand of nationalism, a basic chauvinism so to speak, long 
before the coming of European influences to their country For 
example, the great Muslim scholar, Alberum, who made a special 
effort to know them and their religion, recorded at the beginning 
of the eleventh century that ‘The Hindus believe that there is no 
country but theirs, no nation like theirs, no kings like theirs, no 
religion like theirs, no science like theirs They are haughty, foolishly 
vain, self-conceited ’ This megalomania became far more intense 
and unshakable under Muslim rule, and remained a living passion 
under British rule But it had no historical basis, and could not be 
accepted in its traditional form by the Indians who were receivmg a 
Western education They wanted a nationalism which would be 
tenable historically The Orientalists of Europe supplied the

historical basis by revealing to modern Indians their past history 
and achievements Max Muller fully supported all legitimate use of 
history by them As he put it ‘A people that can feel no pride in the 
past, in its history and literature, loses the mamstay of its national 
character ’ But the question was whether the pride was being felt 
rationally At first, by and large, that was the case 

Comparative Philology entered mto the new Hindu nationalism 
less obviously, but its conclusions were an essential ingredient in 
its composition But it has to be pointed out that new science of 
Comparative Philology created in the nineteenth century had its 
political effects in Europe as well Hitlerism was its late and mon- 
strous abortion, and anti-Semitism a deformed and vicious child 
Withal, it created other political movements which were not looked 
upon as illegitimate These were pan-Germanism, pan- Slavism, 
pan-Islamism and pan-Turamsm This was pointed out by Sir 
Henry Marne in his Rede Lecture, delivered before the University 
of Cambridge in 1875 

Sanscntic study has been the source of certain indirect effects, not 
indeed having much pretension to scientific character, but of prodi- 
gious practical importance There is no question of its having produced 
very serious political consequences, and this is a remarkable illustration 
of the fact that no great addition can be made to the stock of human 
thought without profoundly disturbing the whole mass and moving it 
m the most unexpected directions For the new Theory of Language 
has unquestionably produced a new theory of Race 

That people not necessarily understanding one another’s tongue 
should be grouped together politically on the ground of linguistic 
affinities assumed to prove community of descent, is quite a new idea 
Nevertheless, we owe to it, at all events in part, the vast development 
of German nationality, and we certainly owe to it the pretensions of 
the Russian Empire to at least a presidency over all Slavonic communi- 
ties The theory is perhaps stretched to the point at which it is nearest 
breaking when men, and particularly Frenchmen, speak of the Latin 
race 

That Comparative Philology should make an impact on the Indian 
mind was natural, because that impact was nothing more than a 
recoil to an impact of India on the European mind As Sir Henry 
Maine said ‘India has given the world Comparative Philology and 
Comparative Mythology ’ It is easy to see that in saying so he had 
the work of Max Muller in mind In the inaugural lecture which 



INDIA MOVEMENTS 


313 


Max Muller delivered on being appointed to the new chair of Com- 
parative Philology, he brought out the connexion even more force- 
fully I have already quoted the passage from that lecture in which 
he said that ‘a Comparative Philologist without a knowledge of 
Sanskrit was like an astronomer without a knowledge of mathema- 
tics’ In the same lecture he elaborated the actual historical con- 
nexion between the two by saying 'We may date the origin of 
Comparative Philology, as distinct from the Science of Language, 
from the foundation of the Asiatic Society of Calcutta in 1784 
From that time dates the study of Sanskrit, and it was the study of 
Sanskrit which formed the foundation of Comparative Philology ’ 
The connexion between modern Hindu nationalism and Compara- 
tive Philology was implicit in this purely scholarly affiliation, but it 
owed its full development very largely to the manner in which Max 
Muller presented it to his readers For him this branch of philology 
was not solely an inquiry into the origin and nature of language, but 
also a means of exploring the mind of the earliest civilized man, and 
even more especially the mind of the Aryan man He employed the 
phrase ‘Aryan Race’, frequently, and also idealized the ethnic 
group to which he gave this name. So, there is a likelihood of his 
being regarded as what in these days is called a ‘Racialist’ The two 
words ‘Aryan’ and ‘Race’ have become some sort of red rag to con- 
temporary Radicals This makes it necessary to explain what Max 
Muller meant when he spoke of the Aryan Race There was no 
vagueness in his conception at all In 1872, speaking before the 
University of Strassburg, he said 

These two sciences, the Science of Language and the Science of Man, 
cannot, at least for the present, be kept too much asunder, and many 
misunderstandings, many controversies, would have been avoided, if 
scholars had not attempted to draw conclusions from language to 
blood, or from blood to language When each of these sciences shall 
have carried out independently its own classification of men and of 
languages, then, and then only, will it be time to compare their 
results, but even then, I must repeat, what I have said many times 
before, it would be as wrong to speak of Aryan blood as of dolicho- 
cephalic grammar 

Again, in his book Biographies of Words , published in 1888, he 
wrote 



314 SCHOLAR EXTRAORDINARY 

How then shall we tell from language what races had to learn the 
language of their Aryan conquerors or their Aryan slaves ? There is 
no Aryan race in blood, but whoever, through the imposition of hands, 
whether of his parents or his foreign masters, has received the Aryan 
blessing, belongs to that unbroken spiritual succession which began 
with the first apostles of that noble speech, and continues to the 
present day in every part of the globe Aryan, in scientific language, is 
utterly inapplicable to race It means language and nothing but lan- 
guage, and if we speak of Aryan race at all, we should know that it 
means no more than Aryan speech 

Lastly, addressing the Anthropological Section of the British 
Association at Cardiff in 1891, he gave a summary of his views on 
this question from as early as 1847, and declared that ‘the unholy 
alliance between Philology and Physiology’ had hitherto done 
nothing but mischief 

Speaking of his first appearance at a scientific conference at 
Oxford in 1847, he said that at that time it was taken for granted 
that in future Comparative Philology would be the only safe founda- 
tion for Anthropology Linguistic Ethnology was a very favourite 
term used by Bunsen, Pritchard, Latham and others He protested 
against this view even then, and published his formal protest in 
1853 To Bunsen he said that ‘there ought to be no compromise 
between ethnological and phonological science’ 

Curiously enough, he was often supposed to be the strongest 
advocate of a theory which he was attacking He made a frank 
confession, however, in the address of 1891 ‘Perhaps I was not 
entirely without blame, for, having once delivered my soul, I 
allowed myself occasionally the freedom to speak of the Aryan or 
Semitic race, meaning thereby no more than the people, whoever 
and whatever they were, who spoke Aryan or Semitic languages ’ 
He went on to say that as to the colour of the skin, the hair, the eyes 
of those unknown speakers of Aryan speech, the scholar says 
nothing ‘If we step once from the narrow domain of science into 
the vast wilderness of mere assertion, then it does not matter what 
we say We may say, with Plenka, that all Aryas are dolichocephalic, 
blue-eyed, and blond, or we may say, with Pietrement, that ail 
Aryas are brachycephalic, with brown eyes and black hair There is 
no difference between the two assertions They are both perfectly 
meaningless ’ 

Holding these views he found it paradoxical that he, a philologist, 



INDIA MOVEMENTS 


315 


should be presiding over the Section of Anthropology, and justified 
that in two ways First of all, he thought that at some future time 
some connexion might be discovered between philological and 
anthropological facts But he emphasized strongly that anthropo- 
logists should know more about language, and ventured to hope 
that ‘the time will come when no anthropologist will venture to 
write on anything concerning the inner life of man without having 
himself acquired a knowledge of the languages in which that inner 
life finds its truest expression 5 So it will be seen that in respect of 
the relationship between language and ‘race 5 zoologically defined, 
Max Muller held very sound as well as sane views 

Educated Indians of his time who were becoming familiar with 
these philological discoveries and being influenced by the new ideas, 
did not accept or apply them with his scientific spirit On the con- 
trary, they showed every inclination to do so in a manner which 
could have been called racialist But even here it is very important 
to be precise as to the attitude, for the word ‘racialist 5 has become 
a mere pejorative expression without a correct denotation or corn- 
notation 

What is now called ‘racialism 5 is not a zoological or purely genetic 
concept at all, but a psychological one It is nothing but an exagger- 
ated consciousness of group identity based on a common language 
and a common culture, often accompanied by a sense of superiority 
to other human groups, and always by a desire to preserve the 
identity It should really be regarded as an extreme form of national- 
ism, and the quarrel between the racialists and anti-racialists is 
correctly seen as a conflict between nationalism and cosmopoli- 
tanism This form of nationalism is perpetuated by the mental 
inheritance of a community, but it also has a genetic aspect All 
communities with a well-defined sense of identity are overwhelm- 
ingly endogamous, and this endogamy furnishes a kind of genetic 
support to what is really an acquired character The loyalty to the 
psychological identity is always heightened and made aggressive 
towards other groups by any threat to it 

/ The Hmdus certainly had a high degree of group consciousness, 
a sense of unbridgeable difference from all others, and this was 
accentuated by their habit of giving to all their social relation- 
ships and activities a genetic complexion and cast In ancient times 
what might be called Hindu nationalism retrospectively was based 
on their belief that they were ‘Aryas 5 , and as such not only different

from other peoples and communities, but also superior Anyone 
who is at all familiar with Sanskrit literature cannot be unaware of 
this, cannot remain ignorant of what the notion of being Arya 
meant to the Hindu of ancient times 

To begin with, however, the notion of Arya was applied aggres- 
sively to the older population of the country, to the non-Aryan 
internal proletariat But when other foreigners began from time to 
time to invade India and rule the original Aryan conquerors, the 
notion was extended to them From the Hindu point of view these 
foreigners in their original homes began to be regarded as an exter- 
nal proletariat, and were all indiscriminately lumped under the 
name, Mlechchhas or unclean foreigners Only the Hindu was re- 
garded as Aryan, and as the historical memory was wholly lost, 
India was regarded as the only Aryan land This Aryan pride was 
also seen, though not in so intolerant a form, in Persia as well 
before the spread of Islam, and it has been resuscitated there in 
our time 

This Aryan pride ran in the blood of all Hindus and, transformed 
into a dogmatic megalomania and xenophobia, it enabled them not 
only to survive under foreign rule, but also to despise their foreign 
rulers, whether Muslim or British None the less, it hung in the air, 
without any historical basis Comparative Philology supplied that 
basis, and brought into existence a more rational and also a more 
self-conscious Aryanism among the modern Hindus 

This was the positive influence of the ideas derived from Com- 
parative Philology on Indians They had also a defensive applica- 
tion by which the Hindus tried to maintain their national honoui 
against the very vocal British arrogance in India Whether it was 
asserted or assumed, they resented the British attitude, and fell 
deeply msulted by their treatment as inferiors " Comparative Philo 
logy came to their rescue by showing that not only in their lan 
guages, but even ethnically, they were related to Europeans This 
created an immense enthusiasm and confidence among the Hindus 
which was noticed by Sir Henry Maine when he was a Member o 
the Viceroy’s Council in India and Vice-Chancellor of Calcutta 
University Delivering his Convocation address in 1864 in Calcutta 
he said 

Probably, if we could search into the hearts of the more refiner 

portions of the Native Community, we should find their highes

aspiration was to be placed on a footing of real and genuine equality 
with their European fellow-citizens Some persons have told them 
that they are equals already, equal in fact as they undoubtedly are 
before the law Most of you have heard of one remarkable effort 
which was made to establish this position A gentleman, who was then 
a Member of the Government of India, Mr Lamg, went down to the 
Dalhousie Institute, and, in a lecture delivered there, endeavoured to 
popularize those wonderful discoveries in philological science which 
have gone far to lift the hypothesis of the common parentage of the 
most famous branches of the human family to the level of a scientific 
demonstration I do not know that anybody was ever more to be 
admired than Mr Lamg for that act of courage, for I know how ob- 
stinate were those prejudices which he sought to overthrow, and to 
what height they had risen at the moment when he spoke The effect 
produced by his lecture on the Aryan race must have been prodigious, 
for I am sure I scarcely see a single native book or newspaper which 
does not contain some allusion to Mr Lamg’s argument 

Maine was, however, conscious that there lay a risk for the future 
m this enthusiasm He told the students of Calcutta University 
whom he was addressing that though Mr Lamg taught nothing but 
the truth, it was a barren truth Then he explained himself. 

Depend upon it, very little is practically gamed by the Native when 
it is proved, beyond contradiction, that he is of the same race with the 
Englishman Depend upon it, the true equality of mankind lies, noi 
in the past, but in the future It may come — probably will come — but 
it has not come already 

In the meantime [he continued] the equality which results from 
intellectual cultivation is always and at once possible Be sure that it 
is a real equality No man ever yet genuinely despised, however he 
might hate, his intellectual equal 

Indians by themselves tried to reach that intellectual equality 
and also found that mstead of being despised by the Englishman he 
was being hated But at the same time they also went on advertising 
the equality from the presumed common descent In 1874, a Bengal 
writer had an article in the Indian Mirror , a very influential news 
paper edited by an eminent Bengali, in which he brought out th< 
difference that Sanskntic studies in Europe and Comparative 
Philology had made to the British attitude towards Indians He 
said that at the beginning of their rule the British regarded th 
people of India as little better than niggers, having a civilizatioi 



318 SCHOLAR EXTRAORDINARY 

perhaps a shade better than that of the barbarian, but that the dis- 
covery of Sanskrit had entirely revolutionized the course of thought 
and speculation ‘We were niggers at one time We now become 
brethren 5 Then he continued 

The advent of the English found us a nation low sunk in the mire oi 
superstition, ignorance, and political servitude The advent of scholar' 
like Sir William Jones found us fully established in a rank above that oi 
every nation as that from which modern civilization could be dis 
tmctly traced It would be interesting to contemplate what would have 
been our position if the science of philology had not been discovered 
We should know that it is to the study of the roots and inflexions oi 
Sanskrit that we owe our national salvation Within a few year' 
after the discovery of Sanskrit, a revolution took place in the history 
of comparative science Never were so many discoveries made at once 
and from the speculations of learned scholars like Max Muller, the 
dawmngs of many truths are even now visible to the world Com 
parative mythology and comparative religion are new terms altogethei 
m the world 

There was more than a chance that this reawakening of self 
respect among the modem Hindus could lead them astray But the 
immediate result was something which Max Muller both wel 
corned and admired, because it showed a Ime of development whicl 
he himself was urging on Indians The human urge in all hit 
scholarly work was that, becoming aware of their great past anc 
drawmg on their legacy, they would revitalize their contemporar] 
life, and shed the dead wood which had accumulated through th< 
centuries He saw that the process was unfolding both in its destruc 
tive and constructive aspects 

So, as President of the Aryan Section of the International Con 
gress of Orientalists held in London from September 14 to 21, 187^ 
he described the result of the impact made on Indians by the worl 
of European Orientalists and other scholars He summed up th< 
general drift in one significant sentence ‘Thus the religion, th< 
literature, the whole character of the people of India are becoming 
more and more Indo-European ’ He amplified the formula b 1 
saying 

A new race of men is growing up in India, who have stepped, as it were 
over a thousand years, and have entered at once on the mtellectua 
inheritance of Europe They carry off prizes at English schools, tak 
their degree in English Universities, and are in every respect ou

equals With regard to what is of the greatest interest to us, their 
scholarship, it is true that the old school of Sanskrit scholars is dying 
out, and much will die with it which we shall never recover, but a new 
and most promising school of Sanskrit students, educated by European 
professors, is springing up, and they will, nay, to judge from recent 
controversies, they have already become most formidable rivals to our 
own scholars They work for us, as we work for them 

But there was also another side to the movement which Max 
Muller could not see because he did not visit India Sir Henry 
Maine did see it, and it seemed so ominous to him that he thought it 
necessary to warn his young listeners against it in Calcutta in his 
Convocation address of 1866 In 1870 he said that he had had un- 
usual opportunities of studying the mental condition of the edu- 
cated class in one Indian province (Bengal), and had found that 
though this class was so strongly Europeanized as to be no fair 
sample of native society as a whole, its peculiar stock of ideas was 
probably the chief source from which certain influences were pro- 
ceeding Then he added ‘Here there has been a complete revo- 
lution of thought, in literature, in taste, in morals, and in law ’ 

To the young members of this class he spoke about the strange 
dichotomy in their ideology He said that he had no complaint to make 
of the education which they were receiving, but that he could not 
help being disappointed at the use to which they were sometimes 
putting it Tt seems to me that not seldom they employ it for what 
I can best describe as irrationally reactionary purposes ’ He could 
see plainly that the educated Indians themselves did not conceal 
the fact that by their new education they had broken for ever with 
their past, and abandoned much of the customs and creeds Yet, 
he said, he was constantly reading and sometimes hearing elaborate 
attempts on their part to persuade themselves and others, that there 
was a sense in which these rejected portions of their history, usage 
and belief were perfectly in harmony with the modern knowledge 
which they had acquired, and with the modern civilization to which 
they aspired 

There were some Indians, he went on to say, who seemed to have 
persuaded themselves that there was once a time in India wher 
learning was more honoured and respected, and when the career of £ 
learned man was more brilliant, than in British India and unde] 
British rule So that they believed or tried to believe that it waj 
better to be a Brahmin, or a scribe attached to the court of som<

half-mythical Hindu king, than to follow one of the learned pro- 
fessions which the English had created 

He observed that in point of fact there was no one in the hall in 
which he was speaking to whom the life of a hundred years ago 
would not be acute suffering supposmg it could be lived over again 
Then he declared emphatically 

It is impossible even to imagine the condition of an educated Native, 
with some of the knowledge and many of the susceptibilities of the 
nineteenth century — indeed perhaps with too many of them — if he 
could recross the immense gulf which separates him from the India of 
Hindu poetry, if indeed it ever existed The only India, in fact, to 
which he could hope to return — and that retrogression is not beyond 
the range of conceivable possibilities — is the India of Mahratta robbery 
and Mohammedan rule European influences are, in a great measure, 
the source of these delusions 

He also said that a similar mistake was being made by them when 
they called in ingenious analogies and subtle explanations to justify 
usages which they did not venture to defend directly, or of which 
m their hearts they disapproved He saw a tendency on the part of 
the educated classes to defend practices on the ground that they 
served some practical end or, more often, because something super- 
ficially like them could be found in Europe Then he said ‘There 
is no greater delusion than to suppose that you weaken an error by 
giving it a colour of truth On the contrary, you give it pertinacity 
and vitality, and greater power for evil 9 

The warning was not heeded, the tendency grew, and by the end 
of the century a very plausible Hindu apologia was built up, largely 
on the strength of the very ideas and information supplied by men 
like Max Muller This can be seen in the record of a conversation 
that the French literary critic, Andre Chevrillon, had with a learned 
Bengali, the principal of the college at Jaipur Chevrillon found in 
him a fund of enthusiasm for the old metaphysics of the country, 
and he told the Frenchman ‘Within the last five or six years there 
has been a reaction in its favour Under English influence writers in 
Calcutta (the school of Brahmos) have denounced the immoralities 
and follies of the Hindu religion We now begin to recognize that 
under its extravagance is hidden a profound idea, and you will see 
that it is defended by our scholars and thinkers. We aspire to be 
ourselves 9

Chevrillon commented to himself 'Does this Hindu speak truly ? 
Is it possible that India, becoming once more conscious of herself, 
is throwing off the intellectual yoke of England ? Is it possible that 
m the peace enjoyed under English rule, the Hindu brain, so long 
paralysed by Mohammedan oppression, will once more begin to 
work ? And if so, what will come of it ^ 

Lord Curzon as Viceroy of India was also observing the move- 
ment of the Hindu mind, and on receiving a copy of Max Muller’s 
Auld Lang Syne , vol II, wrote to him on July 26, 1899 

There is no doubt that a sort of quasi-religious, quasi-metaphysical 
ferment is going on in India, strongly conservative and even reactionary 
m its general tendency The ancient philosophies are being re- 
exploited, and their modern scribes and professors are increasing in 
numbers and fame 

What is to come out of this strange amalgam of superstition, trans- 
cendentalism, mental exaltation, and intellectual obscurity — with 
European ideas thrown as an outside ingredient into the crucible — who 
can say ? 

Though Curzon was not fully aware of what had actually hap- 
pened, a strong current of Hindu conservatism with a fairly elab- 
orate ideology of its own, intellectually competent in its higher 
expression, had already come into existence, and it had put the liberal 
Hindu movement on the defensive This revivalist movement be- 
came political in the next stage, and pervaded the nationalist move- 
ment Thus it may be said that the transformation Max Muller 
wanted in Hindu life was turned into a channel of which he could 
not approve but which he and his fellow-Onentalists had provided 
His role in this movement was passive and involuntary But he 
deliberately took up the role of adviser and guide to the movement 
of religious reform in India This was natural on account not only 
of his scholarly interest in Hinduism, but also of his deeply religious 
nature He wanted the Hindus to recast their religious life in the 
light of what he was placing before them as its highest expression 
All through his life, in one way or another, he continued his inter- 
pretation of Hinduism, so that all his writing may be described as 
his exposition, direct or incidental, of the religion, and the most 
formal expositions are to be found in his Hibbert and Gifford 
Lectures But from the reformist point of view he stated his 
position most clearly and briefly in a letter to the Duke of Argyll, 
written in 1869 It has to be quoted in full for its importance

It is certainly true that the religion of the Hindus, as far as we can 
gather from their sacred hymns in the Veda, is free from everything 
that strikes us as degrading in the present state of religion and morality 
m India But between the ancient religion of India and the religious 
worship of the present generation there have been several falls and 
several rises Buddhism, in the sixth century before our era, was a 
reaction against corruptions that had crept into the ancient religion 
even at that early time Then, Buddhism, starting with the highest 
aspirations, degenerated into monasticism and hypocrisy, and a most 
rigorous form of the old Brahxnamc religion took possession of India, 
and drove Buddhism out of every corner of the country Smce that 
time there ha\e been several religious reforms, though of a more local 
character, and this makes it very difficult to generalize and treat the 
whole religious life of India as one organic body of religious thought 
Yet so much may be said with perfect truth, that if the religion of India 
could be brought back to that simple form which it exhibits in the 
Veda , a great reform would be achieved Something would be lost, 
for some of the later metaphysical speculations on religion, and again 
the high and pure and almost Christian morality of Buddha, are things 
not to be found in the Veda But, as far as popular conceptions of the 
deity are concerned, the Vedic religion, though childish and crude, is 
free from all that is so hideous in the later Hindu Pantheon 

As to the potentiality for transformation (in the sense of improve- 
ment), Max Muller made a distinction between the natural and 
historic religion, which he described in this letter as national and 
personal He wrote 

With regard to the inevitable decay of religion, a difference ought to be 
made between two classes of religion, national and personal There are 
ancient religions, like that of Greece, and that of India, too, which 
grow up like national languages, where it is impossible to speak of indi- 
vidual influences, because all individual influence is determined by 
the silent and almost unconscious approval or disapproval of the 
community In these religions I think we can watch for a time a de- 
cided progress, a general elimination of what is bad, i e , what is not 
acceptable to the national conscience 

But religions like Buddhism, Mohammedanism, and Christianity 
too, belong to a different class They start with a high ideal conceived 
by a representative man, representative either of a nation or of the 
whole of humanity, and that high ideal is hardly ever realized, it 
has to adapt itself to larger circles and lower levels, and can only be 
kept from utter degeneration by constant effort at reform

It will be seen from this letter that Max Muller had no admiration 
for the pos t-Vedic manifestations of Hinduism, except for the re- 
ligious aspect of the philosophy of Vedanta He never discussed the 
orgiastic and erotic aspects of Hinduism which some writers in the 
West seem now to regard as the brightest light from the East But 
we can guess what his opinion must have been, for he could not have 
remained ignorant of them As to the beliefs and practices of con- 
temporary Hindus, his unfavourable opinion was openly voiced 
In fact, he considered Brahmanism to be dead, and said so in plain 
language in his Westminster lecture on Missions, delivered on 
December 3, 1873 Referring to the Biahmanic religion he said 

That religion is still professed by at least 110,000,000 of human souls, 
and, to judge from the last census, even that enormous number falls 
much short of the real truth And yet I do not shrink from saying that 
their religion is dying or dead And why ? Because it cannot stand the 
light of day 

The worship of Siva, of Vishnu, and the other popular deities, is 
of the same, nay, in many cases of a more degraded and savage charac- 
ter than the worship of Jupiter, Apollo, and Minerva, it belongs to a 
stratum of thought which lsdong buried under our feet it may live on, 
like the lion and the tiger, but the mere air of free thought and civilized 
like will extinguish it A religion may linger on for a long time, it may 
be accepted by the large masses of the people, because it is there, and 
there is nothing better But when a religion has ceased to produce 
defenders of the faith, prophets, champions, martyrs, it has ceased to 
live, in the true sense of the word, and in that sense the old, orthodox 
Brahmanism has ceased to live for more than a thousand years 

Here he was speaking of that form of Hindu religion which 
according to him appeared in India after the degeneration of 
Buddhism and supplanted Buddhism — the form, that is to say, 
which is conventionally described as the Puramc Then he turned 
to Hinduism as it was practised in his time, and went on to say 

It is true there are millions of children, women, and men in India who 
fall down before the stone image of Vishnu, with his four arms, riding 
on a creature half bird, half man, or sleeping on the serpent, who 
worship Siva, a monster with three eyes, riding naked on a bull, with a 
necklace of skulls for his ornament There are human beings who still 
believe in a god of war, Kartikeya, with six faces, riding on a peacock,

rat Na>, it is true that, in the broad daylight of the nineteenth century, 
the figure of the goddess Kali is carried through the streets of her own 
city, Calcutta, her wild dishevelled hair reaching to her feet, with a 
necklace of human heads, her tongue protruded from her mouth, her 
girdle stained with blood All this is true , but ask any Hindu who can 
read and write and think, whether these are the gods he believes m, 
and he will smile at your credulity How long this living death of 
national religion in India may last, no one can tell for our purposes, 
however, for gaming an idea of the issue of the great religious struggle 
of the future, that religion too is dead and gone 

What Max Muller said about the educated Hindu was only 
partly true If he had mixed with a large number of them, as Sir 
Henry Maine did, he would have found that ‘the educated youth 
of India certainly affect a dislike of many things which they do 
care about, and pretend to many tastes which they do not really 
share’ If Muller had asked his educated Indian whether, gomg 
further than his private scepticism, he was ready to denounce the 
idol-worship openly, he would certainly have heard the argument 
that, however unmeanmgful to him, it was useful for the common 
herd If Muller further asked whether image-worship took place 
m his house, he would have heard the plea that he could not hurt 
the feelmgs of his mother or wife by putting an end to that Muller 
would perhaps have been too polite to ask if the scoffing Hmdu 
himself did not at times descend to this worship and to practices 
much worse, but if he had he would have got only discreet evasion 
However that may be, Max Muller’s view that Brahmanism was 
dead led him into a controversy with Sir Alfred Lyall, whose know- 
ledge of India was both wide and deep He replied to Muller in an 
article in the Fortnightly Review (July i, 1874), and contended that 
so far from being dead Hinduism was very much alive 

Muller replied in the next issue of the Fortnightly Review , and 
tried to explain himself rather than to contradict Lyall He admitted 
that objections raised against his describing Brahmanism as already 
dead had force, and wrote ‘The word was too strong , at all events, 
it was liable to be misunderstood What I meant to say was that the 
popular worship of Siva and Vishnu belongs to the same intellectual 
stratum as the worship of Jupiter and Apollo, that it is an anachro- 
nism in the nineteenth century ’ In support of his position Muller 
quoted Lyall’s opinion ‘That Brahmanism may possibly melt away 
of a heap and break up, I would not absolutely deny ’ This has not

happened, nor is likely to happen In expecting its eventual dis- 
appearance both Max Muller and Sir Alfred Lyall were wrong If 
one is not thinking of becoming , but only of being , Hinduism is what 
the Hindus describe it to be the Eternal Way 

Nevertheless, holding his own view of the religious life of con- 
temporary Hindus, Muller naturally would consider how it could 
be reformed and revitalized In his early days he thought that 
Hinduism could not be reformed, and must be replaced by Chris- 
tianity Thus on August 25, 1856, he wrote to Bunsen from Oxford 
'India is much riper for Christianity than Rome or Greece were at 
the time of St Paul ’ But he added that he would not like to go to 
India as a missionary because that would make him dependent on 
the parsons, and he did not care to go as a civil servant as that would 
make him dependent on the government What he preferred was 
this 'I should like to live for ten years quite quietly and learn the 
language, try to make friends, and then see whether I was fit to take 
part in a work, by means of which the old mischief of Indian priest- 
craft could be overthrown and the way opened for the entrance of 
simple Christian teaching ’ He thought he could manage to go to 
India with Maharajah Dahp Singh, son of Ranjit Singh Dalip 
Smgh, he knew, was much at Court, and it seemed to him that this 
prince, who had become a Christian, was destined to play a political 
part in India 

But of course, nothing came of this, and Muller did not pursue 
the scheme seriously If he had he would have found that it was not 
practical Not that he was wrong in thinking that Christianity would 
appeal to the Hindus, for at that time most educated Hindus with a 
religious bent were feeling the need for a living monotheistic faith. 
But the obstacle to Christianity was not religious, it was political 
and social The British authorities in India were nght in dismissing 
the idea of creating a religious mission for their rule The mere 
suspicion of an interference with religious taboos gave rise to 
serious disaffection among their Hmdu soldiers, and was one of the 
causes of the rebellion next year 

Max Muller subsequently rested his hopes for a religious reform 
m India on the Vedic studies in the West He had already learnt 
about the monotheistic movement of Rammohun Roy, who was 
preaching a new form of Hinduism based on the latest products of 
the Vedic canon, the Upanishads , and had established a monotheistic 
society in Calcutta Rammohun Roy came to England in late life,

and died at Bristol in 1833 He had seen Rosen, the compiler of the 
first printed edition of the Rig-Veda , though a partial one, at work 
on the manuscripts, and told him that instead of wasting his time 
on it, he should study the Upamshads 

In Calcutta, however, some of his followers thought that in order 
to strengthen the movement among the less educated people they 
could not depend solely on the Upamshads , whose doctrines were 
too pure and sublime to suit the gross ideas of common people 
They began to uphold the Vedas as revelation But they soon found 
that the Vedtc corpus was so heterogeneous that as revelation they 
had either to be adopted as a whole or rejected as a whole They 
rejected it formally in 1850 

The lead in this action was taken by Debendranath Tagore, who 
himself had found release from his religious doubts in the Upam- 
shads When he became the leader of the monotheistic society which 
was called the Brahmo Samaj, he thought it necessary to find out 
the real character of the Vedas by sending four young Brahmins to 
Benares to study them at this centre of Hindu learning and religion 
It was upon hearing their account that Debendranath decided to 
make no use of the Vedtc Samhitas for the new monotheism 

Max Muller thought that the sending of the Brahmins might 
have had a connexion with his own work on the Rtg-Veda, and so 
wrote to Debendranath Upon reading the letter, Debendranath 
wrote to Max Muller that he had received no intimation regarding 
Muller’s work on the Rtg-Veda , and that the idea of sending the 
Brahmins to Benares had originated with him independently 

Thus the Vedtc Samhitas , or the Vedas strictly so-called, did not 
form the basis of the Brahmo monotheistic movement, which took 
its stand on the Upamshads Even of them the son of Debendranath 
Tagore, Satyendranath Tagore, who was the first Indian to enter 
the ICS, wrote that his father’s spiritual aspirations were awakened 
and fed by the ‘sublimer portions of those wild treatises \ This was 
as far as the Brahmos in the first stage of their movement would go 
to draw support from the Vedtc texts The Upamshads continued 
to be the theoretical basis of the Brahmo doctrine But spirit and 
liturgy as well as devotions were soon taken over from Christianity, 
and Brahmoism in its spirit though not in its form became an adap- 
tation to Hinduism of Christianity This was due primarily to 
Keshub Chunder Sen, the next leadei of the Brahmo movement 
and a friend of Muller 



INDIA MOVEMENTS 327 

In India the acceptance of the Vedas as a basis for any form of 
modern Hinduism was due to another Hindu reformer, who, how- 
ever, had nothing to borrow from the West This was Swarm 
Dayananda Saraswati, the founder of the Arya Samaj, a very 
nationalistic and somewhat fanatical sect of Hindu monotheists, 
virtually confined to the Punjab and Punjabis He did not know 
English, but he knew the Vedas by heart, and interpreted them in 
his own way He regarded the Vedas as revelation, divinely inspired, 
and supra-human He died in 1883, after the publication of Max 
Muller’s edition of the Rig- Veda, and it was reported that he 
carried the edition with him But in his commentary on the Rig- 
- Veda in Sanskrit he was very hard on Muller He could not 
understand why Mullei cared for the Vedas at all if he did not 
accept their divine origin 

Though Max Muller’s hope that his work on Vedic literature and 
religion would help towards the creation of a new and purer form 
of Hinduism for modern Hindus was not realized, it should not be 
assumed that it made no impact on their religious thought How 
contemporary Hindus regarded his Vedic enterprise has already 
been described Over and above, there is no doubt that his researches 
and ideas acted as a catalyst on the mind of the Hindus More 
especially, his conception of the history of Hinduism, which pre- 
sented an antithesis between its Vedic form and the later so-called 
Puranic form as the most important fact of the evolution, was 
accepted both by liberal and conservative Hindus Though it is no 
longer historically tenable, it still survives in a modified version 
' It is possible that if Max Muller had descended to the claptrap 
about Hinduism ladled out by Western bigots or charlatans of 
Eastern and Hindu spirituality he might have become the founder 
of a school of Hinduism in India But he wholly disapproved of and 
almost despised this Western infatuation with Hinduism, which was 
displayed in his time by Madame Blavatsky in a very assertive form 
Max Muller first heard about her from his Parsee friend, Malabari, 
to whom he wrote in 1879 \* \*1 was muc h amused at your “theosophic 
Russian countess”. If she would learn Panim while she is in India 
she might do more useful work ’ Soon he knew much more about 
her, and grew suspicious Madame Blavatsky had not gone to India 
to learn, but to teach her version of Buddhism and Hinduism 

She was ignorant of Sanskrit and Sanskrit literature, but was 
proclaiming to the world that Hindu philosophy, particularly that 



328 SCHOLAR EXTRAORDINARY 

of the Vedanta and of Buddhism (she could not always distinguish 
one from the other) were infinitely superior to all the philosophies 
of Europe, and even at that time the Brahmans were the depositories 
of the primeval wisdom of the world At one stage she was with 
Dayananda Saraswati, the founder of the Arya Samaj, and she 
declared that between them they would soon promulgate a new 
theosophy which would eclipse all former systems of thought But 
Dayananda was soon disillusioned and would have nothing to do 
with the Polish countess But she founded a Theosophical Society in 
India, with its headquarters at Adyar in Madras 
After her death one of her associates, Colonel Olcott, protested to 
Max Muller, and wanted to know whether he held that there was no 
esoteric interpretation of the Sanskrit Sastras 

Max Muller’s reply was straightforward He flatly contradicted 
that there was anything esoteric in Buddhism, for it was a religion 
for the people at large, for the poor and the suffering and the 
downtrodden He pointed out that Buddha himself protested against 
the idea of keeping anything secret He admitted that there was more 
esotencism in Brahmanism, but even in that there was no such 
thing as an esoteric interpretation of the Sastras These, he said, 
had but one meaning, and all who had been properly prepared by 
education had access to them. 

As to the countess herself, Muller regretted that he had hurt the 
feelings of Colonel Olcott, but he was unmoved as to his general 
judgement He said in a letter to Colonel Olcott written on June 10 , 
1893- 

I felt it my duty to protest against what seemed to me a lowering of a 
beautiful religion Her name and prestige were doing real mischief 
among people who were honestly striving for higher religious views, 
and who were quite willing to recognize all that was true and beautiful 
and good in other religions Madame Blavatsky seems to me to have 
had the same temperament, but she was either deceived by others or 
carried away by her own imaginations 

In India the so-called Theosophy she preached was taken up by a 
number of educated Hindus with somewhat immature ideas about 
religion, especially as proclaimed through the writings and speeches 
of Mrs Annie Besant Max Muller knew that the educated Hindus 
were showing a great readiness to succumb to the Western charla- 
tanry regarding their religion, and he described it in a parable or 
dnshtanta (example) taken from an Indian story 



INDIA MOVEMENTS 329 

Once there was a man with a peculiar power to grunt exactly like 
a pig, and he made a good deal of money by showing off his power of 
mimicry to the common people In one village where he was giving 
an exhibition, a holy man passed by, who decided to teach a lesson 
to these credulous people He advertised that he would show them 
a better performance, with much better grunting, free of cost 
People flocked to him, and, producing a real pig, he squeezed it to 
make it grunt But the people said Ts that all ? We hear that every 
day, what's there to it ^ And they all went away The sage said 
‘Here is a splendid lesson We seldom care for reality, and always 
go in for imitation ’ 

At that time the counter-charlatanry of the Hindus had not yet 
reached the West and found victims Hinduism in a new form was 
being preached by men like Swami Vivekananda, and it was largely 
Vedantic Max Muller welcomed this preaching As he himself has 
said ‘From what I have seen and read of Vivekananda and his 
colleagues, they seem to me honestly bent on doing good work 9 
But even in Vivekananda’s teaching Muller perceived now and then 
something of the old Blavatsky leaven that had not been entirely 
discarded And on more general grounds he gave an opinion which 
was very sound He looked upon Vedanta as an expression of the 
Way of Knowledge of the Hindus, and did not like the dependence 
of the new preachers on Ramakrishna, who belonged to the Way of 
Love He admired Ramakrishna, and wrote a book on him at the 
end of his life, but he could not approve of the mixing up of Rama- 
krishna’s teaching with the Vedanta As he put the matter 

Vivekananda and the other followers of Ramakrishna ought, however, 
to teach their followers how to distinguish between the perfervid 
utterances of their teacher, Ramakrishna, an enthusiastic Bhakta 
(devotee) and the clear and dry style of the Sutras of Badarayana 
However, as long as these devoted preachers keep true to the Upam- 
shads, the Sutras , and the recognized commentaries, whether of Sam- 
kara or Ramanuja, I wish them all the success they deserve by their 
unselfish devotion and their high ideals. 

But this has not happened so far as the popular reception of 
Vivekananda’s teaching is concerned It has resulted for their 
followers in a personality cult of both Ramakrishna and Viveka- 
nanda 

With the realization that he could not influence the Hindu revival

m the way he desired, Muller’s practical interest in the religious 
life of India took another direction Towards the very end of 
his life he tried to persuade that section of the Hindu monotheists 
who owed their inspiration and zeal largely to Christianity, or at 
all events to Christ, to declare themselves formally as Christian 
That was, of course, that branch of the Brahmos which was led by 
his friend Keshub Chunder Sen, and after Keshub’s death by his 
friend and disciple, Protap Chunder Mozoomdar 

The Hindu theists had a great diversity of opinion regarding 
Jesus and Christianity, ranging from intense hatred on the one hand 
to profound respect and personal attachment on the other Sen 
belonged to the latter group Throughout his life he remained 
devoted to Christ, though in his own way He gave an idea of what 
that was in many of the speeches he made in England during his 
visit in 1870 ‘Why,’ he asked, 'have I cherished respect and rever- 
ence for Christ ? Why is it that, though I do not take the name of 
Christian I still persevere in offering my hearty thanksgivings to 
Jesus Christ He gave his answers 

There must be something in the life and death of Christ — there 
must be something in his great gospel which tends to bring comfort 
and light and strength to a heart heavy-laden with iniquity and 
wickedness 

My first inquiry was, What is the creed taught in the Bible ? Must 
I go through all the dogmas and doctrines which constitute Christianity 
m the eye of the various sects, or is there something simple which I 
can at once grasp and turn to account ? 

I found Christ spoke one language and Christianity another I went 
to him prepared to hear what he had to say, and was immensely grati- 
fied when he told me ‘Love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, 
with all thy mind, with all thy soul, and with all thy strength, and 
love thy neighbour as thyself.’ 

Christ never demanded from me worship or adoration that is due to 
God, the Creator of the Universe 

He places Himself before me as the spirit I must imbibe in order to 
approach the Divine Father, as the great Teacher and guide who will 
lead me to God 

Christ demands of us absolute sanctification and purification of the 
heart In this matter, also, I see Christ on one side, and Christian 
sects on the other 

To be a Christian then is to be Christ-like Christianity means be- 
coming like Christ, not acceptance of Christ as a proposition or as an

331 


outward representation, but spiritual conformity with the life and 
character of Christ By Christ I understand one who said, ‘Thy will 
be done \* 

I feel I must love Christ, let Christians say what they like against 
me, that Christ I must love, for he preached love for an enemy 

It was in the light of all this that he said that the so-called fol- 
lowers of Christ were not yet Christian 
After the controversy over the schism in the Brahmo Samaj and 
Max Muller's defence of Keshub Shunder Sen in his letter to The 
Times , the nature of Keshub's adherence to Christianity was dis- 
cussed between them It arose from a complaint by Keshub Chun- 
der Sen about an attack on him by Professor Momer Williams, who 
had replied to Muller's defence About this Sen wrote 

The manner in which he has treated us is so utterly unworthy of 
him, and is marked with such vacillations, wavering, and duplicity, 
that I can have no misgivings in accepting your verdict It seems 
rather strange that Professor Momer Williams, who professes to be a 
devout Christian, should withhold his regard and sympathy from that 
section of the Brahmo community which is most allied to Jesus and 
makes the nearest approach to the religion founded by Him As for his 
arguments, they have been smashed times beyond number In private 
letters to me he professes friendship, and I have simply warned him in 
the most kindly spirit to ascertain facts before rushing into print 

Though Max Muller had his own opinion of Professor Momer 
Williams, he did not wholly condemn him On the other hand he 
tried to make Sen understand why, despite his attitude to Chris- 
tianity, many sincere Christians felt unsympathetic to him In fact, 
it was Sen's Christianity itself which was the cause So Muller him- 
self wrote to Sen that in order to discuss this question he thought 
that a perfect understanding was necessary between the two as to 
the true character of Christ He wrote 

It may seem strange that a son of India, one who calls himself a 
believer in Brahman (the Absolute Spirit), and who therefore, in strict 
theological phraseology, would be called a non- Christian, should have 
given offence to men who call themselves Christians by what seems to 
them language of excessive veneration for Christ Yet it is so, and that 
is why, in the case of some of your critics at least, the objections to 
your deeply impassioned utterances about Christ arise from good and 
honest motives

The difficulty was Sen’s rejection of the very Kerygma of Chris- 
tianity Muller gave him a rather long explanation according to his 
own understanding of it, which he said would be regarded by many 
theologians of his day as very strange Even so he set it forth, and 
the crucial passage was 

Christianity is Christianity by this one fundamental truth, that as God 
is the father of man, so truly, and not poetically or metaphorically 
only, man is the son of God, participating in God’s very essence and 
nature, though separated from God by self and sin This oneness of 
nature (homoousia) between the Divine and the Human does not lower 
the concept of God by bringing it nearer to the level of humanity, on 
the contrary, it raises the old concept of man and brings it nearer to its 
true ideal 

This was Muller’s interpretation of the notion of homoousia put 
into the Christian creed at the Nicene Council at the suggestion of 
Constantine Then he observed \* After these remarks you will better 
be able to understand the danger of speaking of Christ in language 
which carries us back to the panegyrics addressed by pagan poets to 
their gods and idols If you speak of Christ as not perfectly human, 
m His own sense of the word, you make a new idol of Him, and you 
utterly destroy the very soul of His religion ’ 

Sen replied \* 

‘There is hardly a syllable in your last epistle which I should 
hesitate to endorse You have said exactly what I should have 
said, only in a more learned and philosophical style So far as your 
intellectual estimate of Christ is concerned I do not think there is much 
difference between us I am so glad and thankful that the Spirit of 
God has helped me to work my way through Hinduism to the point 
where an enlightened Christianity has brought you I have always 
disclaimed the Christian name, and will not identify myself with the 
Christian church, for I set my face completely against the popular 
doctrine of Christ’s divinity 

There the matter rested so far as Keshub Chunder Sen was con- 
cerned More than this he would not concede But eighteen years 
later Max Muller raised the question of the affiliation of the Brahmo 
movement, led by Keshub Chunder Sen, with Christianity In 1899, 
when he was in Germany, he wrote from Ems a long letter to Protap 
Chunder Mozoomdar, making an appeal to him formally to declare 
his community as Christian 



INDIA MOVEMENTS 333 

My dear friend, You know for many years I have watched your efforts 
to purify the popular religion of India, and thereby to bring it nearer 
to the purity and perfection of other religions, particularly of Chris- 
tianity You know also that I have paid close attention to the en- 
deavours of those who came before you, of men like Rammohun Roy, 
Debendranath Tagore, Keshub Chunder Sen, and others, in whose 
footsteps you have boldly followed I know that you have met with 
many disappointments and many delays, but you have never lost heart 
and never lost patience I confess that I have several times felt very 
unhappy about the mischances that have befallen your good cause, 
but even when Keshub Chunder Sen was forsaken by a number of his 
friends and followers, on utterly insufficient grounds, as far as I could 
judge, and again, when he was taken from us in the very midst of his 
glorious work, I never lost faith in the final success of his work, though 
I began to doubt whether I should live to see the full realization of his 
hopes 

He then spoke about what the Brahmo movement had accom- 
plished and what, as he saw the matter, they had still to do 

You have given up a great deal, polytheism, idolatry, and your ela- 
borate sacrificial worship You have surrendered also, as far as I can 
judge, the claim of divine revelation which had been so carefully for- 
mulated by your ancient theologians in support of the truth of the 
Vedas These were great sacrifices, for whatever may be thought of 
your ancient traditions, to give up what we have been taught by our 
fathers and mothers, requires a very strong conviction, and a very 
strong will But though this surrender has brought you much nearer to 
us, there still remain many minor points on which you differ among 
yourselves in your various samajes or congregations Allow me to say 
that these differences seem to me to have little to do with real religion , 
still they must be removed, because they prevent united action on your 
part If you are once united among yourselves, you need no longer 
trouble about this or that missionary, whether he come from London, 
Rome, Geneva, or Moscow They all profess to bring you the Gospel 
of Christ Take the New Testament and read it for yourselves, and 
judge for yourselves whether the words of Christ as contained in it 
satisfy you 

He reassured Mozoomdar about Christian doctrine and organiza- 
tion 

Christ comes to you [he wrote] as He comes to us in the only trust- 
worthy records preserved of him in the Gospels We have not even the 



334 SCHOLAR EXTRAORDINARY 

right to dictate our interpretation of these Gospels to you, particularly 
if we consider how differently we interpret them ourselves If you 
accept His teachings as recorded, you are a Christian There is no 
necessity whatever for your being formally received into the member- 
ship of one or other sect of the Christian Church, whether reformed 
or unreformed That will only delay the growth of Christianity in 
India 

He recalled Sen’s words to him that after all Christ was in many 
respects an Oriental who might be better understood by Orientals 
He also said that he saw nothing in the proclaimed Brahmo creed 
or the view of God held by the Brahmos which was not Christian 
After developing all his points at length, he closed with this earnest 
and eloquent exhortation 

From my point of view, India, at least the best part of it, is already con- 
verted to Christianity You want no persuasion to become a follower of 
Christ Then make up your mind to act for yourselves Unite your 
flock, and put up a few folds to hold them together, and to prevent 
them from straying The bridge has been built for you by those who 
came before you Step boldly forward, it will not break under you, and 
you will find many friends to welcome you on the other shore, and 
among them none more delighted than your old friend and fellow 
labourer 

Mozoomdar did not answer this letter for a long time, but he pub- 
lished it with a public rejoinder from himself, in which among other 
things he wrote about the attitude of the official representatives of 
Christianity in India 

What disconcerts me is the half-expressed contempt which the 
Christian leaders, even of the liberal school, seem to have of the Hindu 
ideal, and spirituality When I express my ardent love for Christ and 
Christianity, they are kindly in sympathy but the moment I say that 
Christ and His religion will have to be interpreted in India through 
Indian antecedents and the Indian medium of thought, I am suspected 
of trying to bend Christianity down to heathenism. 

Later he wrote to Max Muller 

A wholesale acceptance of the Christian name by the Brahmo Samaj 
is neither possible nor desirable, within measurable time, it would 
lead to misconception, which would do only harm But the acceptance 



INDIA MOVEMENTS 


335 


of the Christ spirit, or, as you term it, ‘the essential religion of Christ’, 
is not only possible, but an actual fact at the present moment Liberal 
souls in Christendom will have to rest content with this at least now , 
and let the name take care of itself 

In the meanwhile, Max Muller had fallen very seriously ill, and 
his life was despaired of But as soon as he was recovered a little, he 
wrote a second letter to Mozoomdar, even before receiving his per- 
sonal answer He had seen the Indian papers and had gathered 
from them that his letter had produced a certain impression He 
had been abused for it both in India and in England He wrote 
‘But surely you owe much to Christ and Christianity, your very 
movement would not exist without Christianity One must be above 
public opinion in these matters, and trust to truth which is stronger 
than public opinion However, the name is a small matter Only I 
thought that truth and gratitude would declare in favour of Chris- 
tian Brahmos, or Christian Aryas \* 

However, on March n, 1900, less than eight months before his 
death, he again wrote to Mozoomdar ‘You ought to know me 
enough to know that I am not trying to convert you to Christianity. 
If you are not a Christian you must not call yourself a Christian 9 
He repeated that he did not want the Brahmos to jom any existing 
Christian church or sect 

You say there that your country cannot do without Christ — that India 
is Christ’s, and Christ is India’s You speak actually of an Indian 
Church of Christ Now these words can have one meaning only You 
are Christ’s, and in that sense you are Christians, without being Roman 
Catholics, or Anglicans, or Lutherans I do not want you to join any 
existing church or sect, I only wish you to give honour to the name of 
Christ to whom you owe the best part of your present religion 

This was Max Muller’s last testament to India about religion 
There can be no doubt that in this he spoke from the heart But it 
embroiled him with the orthodox and dogmatic section of the 
Anglican Church In the Diocesan Conference held at Oxford in the 
autumn of 1899, the Principal of Pusey House denounced Max 
Muller for his letter to Mozoomdar, and declared that Muller had 
asked the Brahmos to call themselves Christian without believing 
m the central doctrine on which the faith and life of the Church was 
founded

The Rev H J Bidder, Vicar of St Giles and a close friend of Max 
Muller, at once replied to the accusation on behalf of his sick 
parishioner, saying that ‘as one privileged to minister to his closing 
days, and well acquainted with his religious convictions, I cannot 
allow the reckless assertion made against Professor Max Muller to 
go uncontradicted in his own city 5 Some more correspondence 
followed, and Mr Bidder wound up in the Oxford Times with this 
remark ‘Perhaps I ought to have remembered that he enjoys a 
position in the greater world of religious thought — to say nothing of 
mward strength and serenity — which places him beyond the reach 
of attack either from private bigotry or from the Oxford Diocesan 
Conference 5 

But the more dogmatic elements in the Anglican Church were 
from the first prejudiced against Max Muller This prejudice burst 
out in public condemnation of him after his lecture on the Missions 
in the nave of Westminster Abbey on December 3, 1873, at the 
invitation of Dean Stanley 

From the next day Muller began to receive both congratulations 
and vituperation Liddon, one of the most eminent Anglican 
divines of that time, seized his hand and told him T rejoice from 
my heart that you have been helping us ’ Ruskm approved But 
there were others who wholly disapproved of what he said Some 
papers wrote that he should be sent to prison for having brawled in 
church, and after reading some of these an Oxford tradesman 
rushed out when he saw Muller passing and said to him ‘Well, sir, 
when they send you to prison, count on a hot dinner from my table 
every week/ Henry Reeve, the editor of the Edinburgh Review , 
though a friend, wrote to Muller ‘By the law of England, as I read 
it, an unordained person who preaches or lectures in a church is 
guilty of a misdemeanour, punishable with three months’ prison \* 
However, Dean Stanley had taken the opinion of Lord Coleridge, 
the Lord Chief Justice, and so Muller could write to his friend 
George Bunsen ‘There is no going to prison yet.’ 

The mam offence was that he deprecated the excessive emphasis 
on the creeds, and also the attempts of some missionaries to uproot 
the converts from their own society In regard to doctrine he had 
said ‘The fundamentals of our religion are not in these poor creeds ; 
true Christianity lives, not in our belief, but in our love — in our love 
of God , and in our love of man, founded on our love of God 9 On this 
Sir Alfred Lyall commented somewhat ironically ‘Missionaries

will even yet hardly agree that the essentials of their religion are 
not in the creeds, but in love, because they are sent forth to pro- 
pound scriptures which say clearly that what we believe or dis- 
believe is literally a burning question ’ 

Max Muller’s relations with other Indian movements have now 
to be considered, though briefly A man of his humanitarian outlook 
could not be indifferent to the social abuses in India, some of which 
were very cruel Earlier in life he had carried on a controversy with 
Raja Radhakanta Deb, whose opinion of the Vedic work of Max 
Muller has been quoted earlier, about the burning of Hindu 
widows, of which the Raja approved theoretically Max Muller 
was puzzled by this, though he had an explanation for it He wrote 

That an educated Hindu should defend the burning of widows seems 
strange , still, if Popes and Cardinals could defend autos-da-fe or the 
burning of heretics, nay even of witches, because the fire would purify 
and save their souls which could not be saved otherwise, why should 
not an Indian Raja have been convinced that the burning of widows 
could not be wrong, believing, as he did, that it was enjoined by a lost 
Sakha of the Veda> and that the poor women could not be saved unless 
they followed their husbands on their heels into another world ? 

He also referred to ancient Teutonic mythology, according to 
which Nanna and Brunhilda were burnt with their husbands 
But in his later life the movement of social reform in which he 
was most interested was the prevention of child marriage in Hindu 
society He had heard of its inhumanity from Rama Bai, as well as 
from his friend the Parsee reformer Malabari Malabari was trying 
to induce the Government of India to stop this by legislation, which 
it was most unwilling to do Its policy was not to interfere with 
Hindu customs and beliefs, and this policy had been formally 
announced in the Proclamation of Queen Victoria to the peoples 
of India So when Malabari wrote to him about his disappointment 
Muller asked him not to consider the battle lost, but also said that 
for the moment nothing more could be expected from the govern- 
ment 

About this custom two questions arose Firstly, whether it was 
sanctioned and made obligatory by the Hindu sacred law, on this 
Muller was positive that no Hindu scripture sanctioned it, and he 
added that no Hindu Pandit now gainsaid his opinion Secondly, 
whether such a widespread Hindu custom should be interfered

with by the government On this too Muller had a definite view 
He was no advocate of social and cultural neutrality on the part of 
the British Government in India He held that Pax Britannic a 
should be supplemented by Lax Bntanmca , and made out his case 
against Hindu infant maruage on the ground of humanity He wrote 
to Malaban on October 26, 1886 

Government does not deserve the name of Government, if it declares 
itself unable to protect each individual subject against personal torts, 
whether sanctioned by customs or not Now, infant betrothal is a tort — 
it is a contract made without consent of one of the parties If therefore 
the party suffers and wishes to be released from an unjust contract, the 
government ought so far to protect him or her Whether the Govern- 
ment is foreign or native, does not matter It is your Government, so 
long as you accept it and enjoy all the advantages of it, and to turn 
round and say that your Government should not prevent and punish 
iniquity is self-contradictory 

He declared emphatically that the ‘custom of infant betrothal is 
unjust, the custom of infant marriage criminal’ But he also knew 
that he would be abused by the Hindus for his opinion, yet he could 
not remain silent, and he said ‘The more my friends in India 
abuse me, the more proud I shall feel If they call you ignorant, 
because you are a Parsee, what will they call me — a mere Mlechchha 
The question came up again in 1890, when Malabari proposed to 
come to England to interest the British Government in his efforts to 
put an end to infant marriage Early in that year Max Muller wrote 
to him, giving his views on child marriage from another angle 

I have never doubted that early marriage is the greatest impediment 
m the natural development of a woman’s character, and I am equally 
certain that your stunted wives and mothers are the chief cause of the 
slow, the very slow social progress in India You have made rapid 
progress in everything else, but you do not know yet what light an 
educated, healthy and thoughtful wife can spread over every home, 
whether rich or poor I have nothing to say about the physiological 
side of the question, but from a psychological point of view, marriage 
at ten, at twelve, even at fifteen, seems to me the surest means to stunt 
the natural growth of the mind in its various phases The law should 
prevent all that is really noxious to physical health, no individual effort 
on the part of men of light and leading in India can effect a change in 
the long-established custom

Later in the year Malabari came to England and established con- 
tacts with leading persons in the country to find out what could be 
done from England to discourage child marriage One of them, 
Lord Northbrook, who was a former Viceroy of India, wrote to 
Muller 

I believe Mr Malabari to be worthy of encouragement, and I am dis- 
posed to think the time has arrived when the question of how far the 
Government of India might so alter the law as to discourage infant 
marriages should be seriously considered by practical men 

Would you support Mr Malabari’s assertion that infant marriage is 
not a Hindu religious institution, but a custom to which no religious 
authority is attached ? 

Muller’s opinion on this subject was, of course, definite He tried 
to establish contacts for Malabari with, for instance, Princess 
Christian, the daughter of Queen Victoria But he also told him 
that, though she had agreed to see him, Malabari should not expect 
her to express any opinion in public, whatever her feelings might 
be about the question Regarding explorations in governmental 
quarters, Muller wrote to Malabari 

Lord Lansdowne has been written to about the enabling clause You 
understand what I mean — a clause enabling a father to keep his 
daughter till the time has come for her to leave her father’s house 
That clause will probably be carried by Lord Lansdowne in Council 
There ought to be no pressure brought to bear on him He ought to be 
allowed to do it himself, spontaneously Any public demonstration to 
bring this about would, under present circumstances, do harm The 
other question, as to raising the age of consent, is much more serious — 
is in fact, a political question, that will have to be fought out openly 
m India 

By that time however social reform had become of secondary 
interest in Indian politics, and the nationalist movement had 
emerged Max Muller watched it from a distance, but did not think 
of intervening in current Indian politics, except on one occasion 
when he thought a deeper issue of Indo-British human relations 
was involved. The occasion was indeed significant, for it not only 
created the Indian National Congress as the organized mouthpiece 
of Indian nationalism, but also brought into being a strong sense

of alienation of the new Indian intelligentsia from British rule 
The occasion was the introduction of the so-called Ilbert Bill, 
technically a bill to modify the Criminal Procedure Code, by Sir 
Courtenay Ilbert, Legal Member of the Viceroy's Executive Coun- 
cil, at the instance of the Viceroy, Lord Ripon It sought to remove 
an anomaly in the judicial system of India which seemed to per- 
petuate a racial discrimination between the British and Indian 
members of the judiciary At that time Indian magistrates and 
judges could not try European (mostly British, of course) accused 
persons in the district courts, though they did so in the capital 
cities of the provinces 

At once there was a furore among the British in India They not 
only started a violent agitation against the bill, but even threatened 
to kidnap the Viceroy and hold him to ransom This resistance was 
encouraged from inside the government even by the members of 
the Indian Civil Service It had a strong backwash in England as 
well What induced Max Muller to join this controversy was a 
report by the judges of Calcutta High Court, which was an implicit 
condemnation of the bill The report was accepted, not as polemics, 
but as a clear, impartial and judicial pronouncement which had to 
be accepted 

This Max Muller disputed in a letter to The Times , published on 
August 6, 1883, refuting the conclusions of the judges paragraph by 
paragraph What surprised him was not so much the loud clamour 
which was taken as a unanimous condemnation of the bill by British 
public opinion both in India and in England, but the number of 
eminent members of the Indian Civil Service and the Indian Army 
who supported Lord Ripon Lord Ripon himself wrote a letter to 
Max Muller, thanking him for his letter On September 3, 1883, 
he wrote from Simla 

Dear Professor Max Muller, I hope that you will excuse me for 
troubling you with a few lines to thank you very much for the able 
letter which you have addressed to The Times in reply to the Report 
of the Judges of the Calcutta High Court upon the so-called ‘Ilbert 
Bill’, and also for the very valuable support which you have given to 
my policy in this country 

I can assure you that I appreciate very highly the assistance with you 
have rendered to me It is a great satisfaction to me to find that the 
course of policy which I am pursuing meets with your approval I have 
need of all the aid which I can receive from England, for I am assailed

here with a storm of bitter and unscrupulous hostility, which you, who 
dwell in a calmer atmosphere, can scarcely realize 

Believe me, 

Yours faithfully 
Ripon 

Muller thanked the Viceroy, and said that his letter was evoked 
by the fear that The Times ‘would go on quoting that Opinion of 
the Judges as unanswerable, till people who did not take the trouble 
to read it would believe that it was so' The bill was passed finally 
with a compromise clause under which a British accused could 
demand half the jury to be European The agitation left a permanent 
legacy of misunderstanding with Indians 

However, Max Muller was a realist, and he disapproved of the 
eagerness of educated Indians to get into the Indian Civil Service, 
that is, to be employed in the administration at the highest level on 
a footing of equality with the British members of the Service So 
he wrote to his friend Malabari on September 5, 1884, when the 
question of the equality of Indians with the British in all matters of 
government was provoking a particularly bitter agitation He wrote: 

With regard to your countrymen, I wonder that they care so much for 
the Indian Civil Service If I were a Hindu, I should look out for very 
different work to benefit my countrymen To tell you the truth, I do 
not believe in the efficiency of a mixed Civil Service Oil and water will 
not mix — let the oil be at the top, there is plenty of room for the water 
beneath 

On the whole, Max Muller immensely admired British rule in India, 
and looked upon it as a political tour deforce His description of it in 
his reminiscences was very graphic 

The government of India by a mere handful of Englishmen [he wrote] 
is, indeed, an achievement unparalleled in the whole history of the 
world The suppression of the Indian Mutiny shows what stuff English 
soldiers and statesmen are made of If people say that ours is not an 
age for Epic poetry, let them read Lord Roberts's Forty-one Years in 
India When I see in a circus a man standing with outstretched legs on 
two or three horses, and two men standing on his shoulders, and other 
men standing on theirs, and a little child at the top of all, while the 
horses are running full gallop round the arena, I feel what I feel when 
watching the government of India One hardly dares to breathe, and

one wishes one could persuade one’s neighbours also to sit still and 
hold their breath If ever there were an accident, the crash would be 
fearful, and who would suffer most? Fortunately, by this time the 
people of India know all this 

He felt too that under the British Parliament’s rule, the Govern- 
ment of India was not what it was under the East India Company 
The motive power, he said, had passed from the highest authority in 
India to people ‘at home’ , by which he meant that India had be- 
come enmeshed in British party politics He even felt that ‘Mill, 
who was so much abused for his defence of the old East India 
Company, was right after all, and that it was a misfortune for India 
when it was drawn mto the vortex of party government’ 

After the Ilbert Bill Muller laid the blame for the disturbed 
political atmosphere in India partly on the Opposition, and said 
‘There are some politicians who would not shrink from saying, 
“Perish India, if only we can oust Gladstone 1 ” What India wants, 
and will want for many years to come, is rest and quiet work ’ He 
considered the British residents in India even more responsible 
As he wrote to Malabari in 1884 ‘The fault, however, lies not with 
you, but with the new race of English settlers in India Unless they 
are taught how to behave, and kept under control by a strong hand, 
government in India will become impossible the whole blame 
for the present disturbed state falls on the English settlers in India, 
and on the scheming politicians in England ’ In this he was right 
But Max Muller was not yet prepared to envisage an India inde- 
pendent of British rule Considering the renewed political dissatis- 
faction among Indians in 1896, this time over the cost of the Indian 
troops sent to Egypt, he wrote to Malabari 

I wish there was more English feeling in India, and that it would show 
itself in words and deeds What is the use of haggling over the pay of 
an Indian regiment in Egypt? It is a mere nothing compared with the 
true interests, the peace, and prosperity of India I can understand 
Indian patriots who wish to get rid of England altogether, but those 
who see what that would mean should take to their oars manfully, and 
pull a good English stroke You are in the same boat — you can float 
together, and you would go down together So it strikes me, though 
you know that I am generally on the Indian side 

It has to be added that in expressing this kind of opinion at the 
end of the century, Muller was not saying something with which the

greatest Indians of the age did not agree Bankim Chandra Chatterji, 
who is regarded as an apostle of Bengali nationalism and revolu- 
tionary activity, tried to drive the moral home in his famous novel 
Ananda Math, namely that British rule in India was providential 
Before him the great Indian reformer Rammohun Roy, who is 
looked upon as the precursor of Indian nationalism, had said to 
Victor Jacquemont that ‘India requires many more years of English 
domination so that she may not have many things to lose while she 
is reclaiming her political independence 5 

Max Muller also pleaded for leniency to those who were con- 
sidered to be dangerous extremists among the nationalist leaders 
m India So, when the famous nationalist Tilak was imprisoned for 
sedition in 1898, he put his signature to a petition which urged 
consideration to be shown to him Muller wrote to Sir John Lub- 
bock explaining why he spoke for Tilak 

My interest in Tilak is certainly that of a Sanskrit scholar, for though 
I do not agree with the arguments put forward in his Orion , or Researches 
into the Antiquity of the Vedas (Bombay, 1893), I cannot help feeling 
sorry that we should lose the benefit of his labours I sent him my 
edition of the Rig - Veda , but I am told now that he is not allowed to 
read even his Bible and Prayer-book in prison You see, from the 
wording of the petition, that we do not question the justice of the sen- 
tence But the warning has now been given, and none too soon, 
though I do not believe that there is any sedition lurking in India at 
present, not even in the hearts of such men at Tilak 

Max Muller was in his fundamental inclinations an enthusiast, 
and remained one till his last day But what was equally pronounced 
m him as an intellectual was his balance of mind and capacity to see 
both sides of any question He could thus support British rule in 
India and also champion India and Indians
