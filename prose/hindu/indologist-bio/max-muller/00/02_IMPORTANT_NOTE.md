title = "02 IMPORTANT NOTE"

+++

The fact that Max Muller was German by birth and spent his early 
life in Germany, has quite unnecessarily fixed the idea that he was a 
German scholar writing in German Actually, he was naturalized in 
England and always wrote in English with complete mastery of the 
language, except when he employed German for a special purpose in a 
book, article, or his correspondence The lists given in the two appendices 
specify which books or documents are in German All others are in his 
own English
