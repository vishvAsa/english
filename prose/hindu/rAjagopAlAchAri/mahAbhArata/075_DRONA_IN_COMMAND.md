title = "075 DRONA IN COMMAND"

+++
DURYODHANA and Karna held counsel
as to who should be put in supreme
command of the forces.
"Well, everyone of these princely warriors
fighting on your side is great enough to be
put in charge of our forces as supreme
commander," said Karna.
"All these kings are of equal prowess,
strength, energy, skill, courage, valor,
ancestry and wisdom. They cannot all be
put in joint command and, if any of them
be chosen, each of the others would feel
hurt and may not put forth his whole
strength in the cause. Thereby we stand to
suffer. So, my advice is that we install
Dronacharya, the teacher of all these
princes and warriors, as supreme
commander. He indeed is the greatest of
all those that carry arms today. No
kshatriya equals him in the qualities
required for leading our army. Let us
therefore install him."
Duryodhana agreed that this was the right
thing to do, and so it was decided.
Duryodhana went to Dronacharya and, in
the presence of the assembled warriors
and princes, bowed and addressed him:
"Revered Master, you are unrivalled
among all those assembled here in caste,
ancestry, knowledge of sciences, age,
wisdom, valor and skill. I beg of you to
accept the supreme command. Under your
command, this army will be victorious."
The assembled kings received this
proposal with loud cheers and war cries
that gladdened Duryodhana's heart.
Drona was installed in due form amidst
thunderous acclamation. The praise of
courtiers and the sound of trumpets that
accompanied the ceremony, made the
Kauravas feel as though they had already
vanquished the enemy. So great was their
enthusiasm and confidence in Drona's
leadership.
Drona arrayed the army in circular
formation. Karna, who had till then stood
aside was now seen moving about in his
great chariot on the battlefield and this put
new courage and joy into the hearts of the
Kaurava soldiers.
The talk went round in the army that the
great Bhishma did not wish to slay the
sons of Pandu and therefore had not put
his whole heart in the fight. But now that
Karna was in the field, it was certain that
the Pandavas would be destroyed.
Dronacharya was in command for five
days of the battle. Though of advanced
years, he was everywhere in the field and
displayed the fierce energy of a young
warrior. Whenever he led an attack, thePandava forces were scattered like clouds
before a storm.
He personally engaged the greatest
warriors on the Pandava side in battle. He
fought
Satyaki,
Bhima,
Arjuna,
Dhrishtadyumna, Abhimanyu, Drupada
and Kasiraja and defeated them on many
occasions.
He harassed and inflicted severe
punishment on the Pandava army during
the five days he was in command.
