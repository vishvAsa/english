## AUTHOR'S PREFACE
IT is not an exaggeration to say that the
persons and incidents portrayed in the
great literature of a people influence
national character no less potently than
the actual heroes and events enshrined in
its history. It may be claimed that the
former play an even more important part
in the formation of ideals, which give to
character its impulse of growth.
In the moving history of our land, from
time immemorial great minds have been
formed and nourished and touched to
heroic deeds by the Ramayana and the
Mahabharata. In most Indian homes,
children formerly learnt these immortal
stories as they learnt their mother tongue
at the mother's knee. And the sweetness
and sorrows of Sita and Draupadi, the
heroic fortitude of Rama and Arjuna and
the loving fidelity of Lakshmana and
Hanuman became the stuff of their young
philosophy of life.
The growing complexity of life has
changed the simple pattern of early home
life. Still, there are few in our land who do
not know the Ramayana and the
Mahabharata. Though the stories come to
them so embroidered with the garish
fancies of the Kalakshepam (devotional
meeting where an expert scholar and
singer tells a story to his audience) and the
cinema as to retain but little of the dignity
and approach to truth of Vyasa or
Valmiki. Vyasa's Mahabharata is one of
our noblest heritages. And it is my
cherished belief that to hear it faithfully
told is to love it and come under its
elevating influence. It strengthens the soul
and drives home, as nothing else does, the
vanity of ambition and the evil and futility
of anger and hatred.
The realities of life are idealised by genius
and given the form that makes drama,
poetry or great prose. Since literature is
closely related to life, so long as the
human family is divided into nations,
literature cannot escape the effects of such
division.
But the highest literature transcends
regionalism and through it, when we are
properly attuned, we realise the essential
oneness of the human family. The
Mahabharata is of this class. It belongs to
the world and not only to India. To the
people of India, indeed, this epic has been
an unfailing and perennial source of
spiritual strength. Learnt at the mother's
knee with reverence and love, it has
inspired great men to heroic deeds as well
as enabled the humble to face their trials
with fortitude and faith.
The Mahabharata was composed many
thousand years ago. But generations of
gifted reciters have added to Vyasa's
original a great mass of material. All the
floating literature that was thought to be
worth preserving, historical, geographical,
legendary
political,
theological
and
philosophical, of nearly thirty centuries,
found a place in it.
In those days, when there was no printing,
interpolation in a recognised classic
seemed to correspond to inclusion in the
national library.
Divested of these
accretions, the Mahabharata is a noble
poem possessing in a supreme degree the
characteristics of a true epic, great and
fateful movement, heroic characters and
stately diction.
The characters in the epic move with the
vitality of real life. It is difficult to find
anywhere such vivid portraiture on so
ample a canvas. Bhishma, the perfect
knight; the venerable Drona; the vain but
chivalrous Karna; Duryodhana, whose
perverse pride is redeemed by great
courage in adversity; the high souled
Pandavas with godlike strength as well as
power of suffering; Draupadi, most
unfortunate of queens; Kunti, the worthymother of heroes; Gandhari, the devoted
wife and sad mother of the wicked sons of
Dhritarashtra, these are some of the
immortal figures on that crowded, but
never confused, canvas.
Then there is great Krishna himself, most
energetic of men, whose divinity
scintillates through a cloud of very human
characteristics. His high purposefulness
pervades the whole epic. One can read
even a translation and feel the over
whelming power of the incomparable
vastness and sublimity of the poem.
The Mahabharata discloses a rich
civilisation and a highly evolved society,
which though of an older world, strangely
resembles the India of our own time, with
the same values and ideals. India was
divided into a number of independent
kingdoms.
Occasionally,
one
king,
more
distinguished or ambitious than the rest,
would assume the title of emperor,
securing the acquiescence of other
royalties, and signalised it by a great
sacrificial feast. The adherence was
generally voluntary. The assumption of
imperial title conferred no overlordship.
The emperor was only first among his
peers.
The art of war was highly developed and
military prowess and skill were held in
high esteem. We read in the Mahabharata
of standardised phalanxes and of various
tactical movements. There was an
accepted code of honorable warfare,
deviations from which met with reproof
among Kshatriyas. The advent of the Kali
age is marked by many breaches of these
conventions in the Kurukshetra battle, on
account of the bitterness of conflict,
frustration and bereavements. Some of the
most impressive passages in the epic
center round these breaches of dharma.
The population lived in cities and villages.
The cities were the headquarters of kings
and their household and staff. There were
beautiful palaces and gardens and the
lives led were cultured and luxurious.
There was trade in the cities, but the mass
of the people were agriculturists.
Besides this urban and rural life, there was
a very highly cultured life in the seclusion
of forest recesses, centerd round ascetic
teachers. These ashramas kept alive the
bright fires of learning and spiritual
thought. Young men of noble birth
eagerly sought education at these
ashramas. World-weary aged went there
for peace. These centers of culture were
cherished by the rulers of the land and not
the proudest of them would dare to treat
the members of the hermitages otherwise
than with respect and consideration.
Women were highly honored and entered
largely in the lives of their husbands and
sons. The caste system prevailed, but
intercaste marriages were not unknown.
Some of the greatest warriors in the
Mahabharata were brahmanas.
The
Mahabharata has moulded the character
and civilisation of one of the most
numerous of the world's people.
How did it fulfil, how is it still continuing
to fulfil, this function? By its gospel of
dharma, which like a golden thread runs
through all the complex movements in the
epic. By its lesson that hatred breeds
hatred, that covetousness and violence
lead inevitably to ruin, that the only real
conquest is in the battle against one's
lower nature.
