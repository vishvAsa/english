title = "058 THE PANDAVA GENERALISSIMO"

GOVINDA reached Upaplavya and told
the Pandavas what had happened in
Hastinapura.
"I spoke urging what was right and what
was also good for them. But, it was all in
vain. There is now no way out except the
fourth, that is, the last alternative of war.
The foolish Duryodhana would not listen
to the advice tendered to him by the elders
in the assembly. We must now prepare for
war without delay. Kurukshetra is waiting
for the holocaust."
"There is no longer any hope of peace,"
said Yudhishthira, addressing his brothers,
and issued orders for marshalling their
forces in, battle array.
They formed the army in seven divisions
and
appointed
Drupada,
Virata,
Dhrishtadyumna,
Sikhandin,
Satyaki,
Chekitana and Bhimasena at the head of
each division. They then considered who
should be appointed Generalissimo.
Addressing Sahadeva, Yudhishthira said:
"We should select one of these seven to be
Supreme Commander. He should be one
capable of successfully facing the great
Bhishma, who can burn enemies to ashes.
He should be one who knows how to
dispose his forces as circumstances
require from time to time. Who do you
think
is
most
fitted
for
this
responsibility?"
In the olden days, it was the practice to
ascertain the views of younger people
first, before consulting elders. This
instilled enthusiasm and self-confidence
in the younger folk. If the elders were
consulted first, it would not be possible
for others to speak with freedom, and
even honest differences of opinion might
savor of disrespect.
"Let us take as our Supreme Commander
the king of Virata who helped us when we
lived in disguise and with whose support
we now demand our share of the
kingdom," replied Sahadeva.
"It seems to me best to make Drupada the
Generalissimo, for, in point of age,
wisdom, courage, birth and strength, he is
supreme," said Nakula.
"Drupada, the father of Draupadi, has
learnt archery from Bharadwaja, and has
for long been waiting for an encounter
with Drona. He is much respected by all
kings, and is supporting us, as if we were
his own sons. He should lead our army
against Drona and Bhishma."
Dharmaputra then asked Dhananjaya for
his opinion. "I think, Dhrishtadyumna
should be our chief in the battlefield. The
hero who has his senses under control and
who has been born to bring about Drona'send. Dhrishtadyumna alone can withstand
the arrows of Bhishma whose skill in
archery made even the great Parasurama
hold back. He is the only man fitted to be
our commander. I can think of no one
else," replied Arjuna.
Bhimasena said: "O king, what Arjuna
says is true, but the rishis and elders have
said that Sikhandin has come into the
world to kill Bhishma. My inclination
would be to give the command to
Sikhandin whose radiant face is like that
of Parasurama. I do not think any one else
can defeat Bhishma."
Yudhishthira finally asked Kesava for his
opinion. "The warriors mentioned are,
each one of them, worthy of selection,"
said Krishna. "Any one of them would fill
the Kauravas with fear. All things
considered, I would endorse Arjuna's
choice.
Anoint
Dhrishtadyumna,
therefore, as your Supreme Commander."
Accordingly, Dhrishtadyumna, Drupada's
illustrious son, who led Draupadi at the
swayamvara and gave her away to Arjuna,
who for thirteen long years was brooding
over the insult that his sister had to suffer
in Duryodhana's court, and who was
waiting for an opportunity to avenge the
wrong,
was
anointed
Supreme
Commander of the Pandava army.
The lion-roar of warriors, the blowing of
conchs and shells and the trumpeting of
elephants rent the air, With warlike cheers
which made the sky ring, the Pandava
army entered Kurukshetra in martial
array.
