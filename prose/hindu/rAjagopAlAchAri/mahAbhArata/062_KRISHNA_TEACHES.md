ALL was ready for the battle. The
warriors on both sides gathered together
and solemnly bound themselves to honor
the traditional rules of war.
The code of conduct in war and methods
of warfare vary from time to time. It is
only if what was in vogue at the time of
the Mahabharata war is kept in mind that
we can understand the epic. Otherwise,
the story would be puzzling in places.
From what follows, the reader may have
some idea of the rules of warfare followed
in the Kurukshetra battle. Each day, the
battle was over at sunset, and the hostiles
mixed freely like friends.
Single combats might only be between
equals and one could not use methods not
in accordance with dharma. Thus those
who left the field or retired would not be
attacked. A horseman could attack only a
horseman, not one on foot.
Likewise, charioteers, elephant troops and
infantrymen could engage themselves in
battle only with their opposite numbers in
the enemy ranks.
Those who sought quarter or surrendered
were safe from slaughter. Nor might one,
for the moment disengaged, direct his
weapons against another who was
engaged in combat.
It was wrong to slay one who had been
disarmed or whose attention was directed
elsewhere or who was retreating or who
had lost his armor. And no shafts were to
be
directed
against
non-combatant
attendants or those engaged in blowing
conchs or beating drums.
These were the rules that the Kauravas
and the Pandavas solemnly declared they
would follow.
The passage of time has witnessed many
changes in men's ideas of right and wrong.
Nothing is exempt from attack in modern
warfare.
Not only are munitions made the target of
attack, but dumb animals such as horses,
camels, mules and medical stores, nay,
non-combatants of all ages, are destroyed
without compunction.
Sometimes the established conventions
went overboard even in the Mahabharata
war.
We see clearly in the story that occasional
transgressions took place for one reason
or another. But, on the whole, the
accepted rules of honorable and humane
war were observed by both sides in the
Kurukshetra battle. And the occasional
violations were looked upon as wrong and
shameful.
Addressing the princes under his
command, Bhishma said: "Heroes, yours
is a glorious opportunity. Before you, are
the gates of heaven wide open. The joy of
living with Indra and Brahma awaits you.Pursue the path of your ancestors and
follow the kshatriya dharma. Fight with
joy and attain fame and greatness. A
kshatriya does not wish to die of disease
or old age in his bed but prefers to die on
the battlefield," and the princes responded
by ordering their trumpets to be sounded
and shouted victory to the Kauravas.
On Bhishma's flag shone brightly the
palm tree and five stars. On Aswatthama's
the lion tail fluttered in the air.
In Drona's golden-hued standard, the
ascetic's bowl and the bow glistened, and
the cobra of Duryodhana's famed banner
danced proudly with outspread hood.
On Kripa's flag was depicted a bull, while
Jayadratha's carried a wild boar. Likewise
others and the battlefield thus presented a
pageant of flags.
Seeing the Kaurava forces ranged in battle
array, Yudhishthira gave orders to Arjuna:
"The enemy force is very large. Our army
being smaller, our tactics should be
concentration rather than deployment that
will only weaken us. Array our forces,
therefore, in needle formation."
Now, when Arjuna saw men arrayed on
both sides for mutual slaughter, he was
deeply agitated and Krishna spoke to him
in order to quell his agitation and remove
his doubts.
Krishna's exhortation to Arjuna at this
juncture is the Bhagavad Gita, which is
enshrined in millions of hearts as the
Word of God. The Bhagavad Gita is
acknowledged by all as one of the
supreme treasures of human literature.
Its gospel of devotion to duty, without
attachment or desire of reward, has shown
the way of life for all men, rich or poor,
learned or ignorant, who have sought for
light in the dark problems of life.
