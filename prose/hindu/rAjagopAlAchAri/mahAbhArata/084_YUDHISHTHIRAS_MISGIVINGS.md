+++
WHEN the Pandavas saw Duryodhana
proceeding in the direction of Arjuna, they
attacked the Kaurava army in force so as
to hold Drona and prevent him from going
to Jayadratha's rescue.
So, Dhrishtadyumna led his forces
repeatedly against Drona. As a result of
all this, the Kaurava army had to fight on
three fronts, and was greatly weakened.
Driving his chariot right against Drona's,
Dhrishtadyumna attacked him violently.
Drona's chestnut horses and the Panchala's
dove-colored ones were entangled with
one another and presented a picturesque
sight like the clouds at sunset.
Dhrishtadyumna threw away his bow and,
sword and shield in hand, he sprang upon
Drona's chariot. Now standing on the
shafts of the vehicle, now on the horses
and now on the yoke, he attacked Drona
bewilderingly, all the while seeming to
scorch him with baleful and bloodshot
eyes.
Long did this fight go on. Drona pulled
his bow in great wrath and sent a shaft,
which would have drunk the Panchala's
life but for the unexpected intervention of
Satyaki who sent an arrow and diverted
the acharya's shaft.
Drona then turned and attacked Satyaki,
which enabled the Panchala warriors to
take Dhrishtadyumna away. Drona,
hissing like a black cobra, his eyes red
with anger, advanced on Satyaki who was
among the front rank warriors on the
Pandava side and who, when he saw
Drona desiring battle, went forward to
accept the challenge.
"Here is the man who, giving up his
vocation as a brahmana has taken up the
profession of fighting and is causing
distress to the Pandavas," Satyaki said to
his charioteer. "This man is the principal
cause of Duryodhana's arrogance. This
man fancies himself a very great soldier
and is ever bursting with conceit. I must
teach him a lesson. Take the chariot up
quickly."
Satyaki's charioteer accordingly lashed the
silver-white horses and took the car at a
great pace. Satyaki and Drona shot shafts
at one another so quick that they covered
the sun, and the battlefield was in
darkness for a while. The steel shafts
swished glimmering like newly-sloughed
snakes rushing about.
The chariot hoods and the flagstaffs on
both sides were battered down. Drona as
well as Satyaki were bleeding profusely.
The warriors on either side stood still
watching the duel and they did not blow
their conchs or raise their war cries or
sound their lion-roars.
The Devas, Vidyadharas, Gandharvas and
Yakshas watched the great battle from
above. Drona's bow was broken by a well-
aimed shaft from Satyaki, and the son of
Bharadwaja had to take another bow and,
even as he strung it, Satyaki shot it down
again. Drona took up another bow that
too was shot down.
And so it went on till Drona lost a
hundred and one bows without being able
to shoot an arrow. The great acharya said
to himself: "This man Satyaki is a warrior
in the class of Sri Rama, Kartavirya,
Dhananjaya and Bhishma,"and was glad
he had an opponent worthy of him.
It was a craftsman's professional joy at
skill displayed in the art he loved. For
every specially-charged shaft that Drona
sent, Satyaki had a ready answer of
equivalent quality. Long did this equal
combat continue. Drona of unrivalled skill
in archery then resolved on killing Satyaki
and sent the fire astra. But Satyaki saw
this and, losing no time, sent the Varuna
astra to counteract it.But now Satyaki's strength began to fail
and, seeing this, the Kaurava warriors
were glad and shouted in satisfaction.
When Yudhishthira saw Satyaki was hard
pressed, he told those nearby to go to
Satyaki's relief. "Our great and good hero
Yuyudhana
(Satyaki)
is
being
overpowered by Drona. You should go
there at once," he said to Dhrishtadyumna.
"The brahmana will otherwise slay
Satyaki in a few minutes. Why are you
hesitating? Go at once. Drona is playing
with Satyaki as a cat plays with a bird.
Satyaki is indeed in the paws of the
Destroyer." Yudhishthira ordered the
army to make a powerful attack on Drona.
Satyaki was saved with difficulty. Just
then, the sound of Krishna's conch was
heard from the sector where Arjuna was
fighting.
"O Satyaki, I hear Panchajanya," cried
Yudhishthira; "but the twang of Arjuna's
bow does not accompany it. I fear Arjuna
has been surrounded by Jayadratha's
friends and is in danger. Arjuna is
opposed by forces both in front of him
and in his rear. He pierced the Kaurava
ranks in the morning and he has not come
back yet though the greater part of the day
is gone. How is it that only Krishna's
conch is heard? I fear Dhananjaya has
been slain and therefore Krishna has taken
up arms. Satyaki, there is nothing you
cannot accomplish. Your bosom friend
Arjuna, he, who taught you, is in mortal
danger. Often has Arjuna spoken to me
admiringly of your great skill and
prowess. 'There is not another soldier like
Satyaki,' he said to me when we were in
the forest. Oh, look there! The dust is
rising that side. I am certain Arjuna has
been surrounded. Jayadratha is a powerful
warrior, and there are many enemy
warriors there helping him and resolved to
die in defence of him. Go at once,
Satyaki." Thus did Dharmaputra speak in
great trepidation.
Satyaki, who was weary after his battle
with Drona, replied: "Faultless among
men, I shall obey your command. What
would I not do for Dhananjaya's sake? My
life is the merest trifle in my eyes. If you
order me, I am ready to fight the gods
themselves. But allow me to put before
you what the wise Vasudeva and Arjuna
told me when they left. 'Until we return
after slaying Jayadratha you should not
leave Yudhishthira's side. Be vigilant in
protecting him. We entrust this to you in
confidence and go. There is only one
warrior in the Kaurava army whom we
fear, and he is Drona. You know his
sworn
intention.
We
go
leaving
Dharmaputra's safety in our hands.' Thus
said Vasudeva and Arjuna to me when
they went. Arjuna laid this trust on me,
believing me fit for it. How can I
disregard his command? Do not have any
fear about Arjuna's safety. No one can
defeat him. The Sindhu king and the
others cannot cope with a sixteenth part of
Arjuna. Dharmaputra, to whom shall I
entrust your safety if I must go? I see no
one here who can stand against Drona if
he comes to seize you. Do not ask me to
go. Consider well before you command
me to leave."
"Satyaki," replied Yudhishthira, "I have
thought over it. As I have weighed the
danger against the need and I have
concluded that you must go. You leave
me with my full permission. Here is the
powerful Bhima to look to my safety.
There is Dhrishtadyumna also, and there
are many others besides. There is no need
to worry about me."
So saying, Yudhishthira placed a boxful
of arrows and other weapons in Satyaki's
chariot and got fresh horses yoked thereto
and sent Satyaki uttering benedictions on
him."Bhimasena, Yudhishthira is your charge.
Be vigilant," said Satyaki, and went to
join Dhananjaya.
Satyaki met with violent resistance as he
proceeded to dash through the Kaurava
forces. But he cut his way through bearing
down all opposition. But the resistance
was very stiff and his progress was slow.
When Drona saw Satyaki part from
Yudhishthira, he began to assault the
Pandava formation without rest or
interval, until it began to break and retreat.
Yudhishthira was greatly agitated.
