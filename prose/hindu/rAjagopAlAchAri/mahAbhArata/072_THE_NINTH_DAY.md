title = "072 THE NINTH DAY"

+++
ON the morning of the ninth day, before
the battle began, Duryodhana was
closeted with the grandsire. He gave vent
to his bitter feelings of disappointment
over the way the battle was going. He
uttered words that were like the sharp
spears and pained the grandsire greatly
but the latter was patient and said sadly:
"Like ghee on the sacrificial fire I am
pouring my life out for you. Why do you
seek to mortify me, who have been doing
my very utmost for you? You speak like a
man of no understanding, not knowing
what is right and what is wrong. They say
that, when a man is nearing his death, the
tree appears to him to be made of gold.
You see things now, not as they are. Your
vision is clouded. You are now reaping
the harvest of the hatred you deliberately
sowed. The best course for you are to go
on fighting, as well as you can. This is
also the plain path of duty. It is not
possible for me to fight Sikhandin, for I
can never raise my hand against a woman.
Nor can I with my hands kill the
Pandavas, for my mind revolts against it. I
will do everything barring these two and
fight all the warriors opposed to you.
Nothing is gained by losing heart. Fight as
a kshatriya should and honor will be yours
whatever the events."
Saying thus to Duryodhana and cheering
him up with wise and affectionate words,
Bhishma proceeded to issue instructions
for arraying the forces for the day's battle.
Duryodhana was heartened. He sent for
Duhsasana and said to him: "Brother, put
forth all our strength in today's battle. I am
convinced, the grandsire is fighting on our
side with his whole heart. It is only
against Sikhandin, he says, he cannot use
his weapons. We should see that he is not
exposed to Sikhandin's attacks, for you
know, even a wild dog can kill a lion if
the latter scorns to fight back."
There was a great fight between
Abhimanyu and Alambasa. Abhimanyu
demonstrated that his valor was no less
than his illustrious father's. Alambasa had
to flee on foot to save himself.
There were fierce combats between
Satyaki and Aswatthama and between
Drona and Arjuna. Thereafter, all the
Pandavas attacked the grandsire andDuryodhana sent Duhsasana to support
the old warrior. Bhishma fought furiously
and beat the Pandavas back.
The Pandava forces were thoroughly
demoralised and were flying hither and
thither, like cattle that had lost their way
in the forest.
Krishna halted the chariot and said to
Arjuna: "Partha, you and your brothers
were looking forward to this day, after
thirteen years. Do not hesitate to kill the
grandsire. Remember the duty of a
soldier."
Arjuna bent his head down and, without
looking up, replied: "I would much rather
have continued to be an exile in the forest
than kill the grandsire and the teachers
whom I love, but I shall obey you. Drive
on."
Arjuna's heart was not in the fight.
Unwillingly and in great distress of mind,
he proceeded to the combat. Bhishma, on
the other hand, burnt fiercely like the
noonday sun.
When the army saw Arjuna's chariot
proceed towards Bhishma, it regained
courage and order once again prevailed.
Bhishma's arrows came thick and fast and
covered the advancing chariot so
completely that neither horses nor
vehicles could be seen.
Krishna was unperturbed and drove on
with circumspection and skill. Arjuna's
shafts hit Bhishma's bow and shattered it
many times. But the grandsire went on
renewing his weapon.
"You are not fighting, Arjuna, as you
should!" exclaimed Krishna, and jumped
down in a rage from the chariot and,
taking up his discus, he advanced towards
the grandsire.
Bhishma saw Vasudeva approaching.
"Hail, O Lotus-eyed One!" he cried.
"Blessed am I to be separated from the
body by you! Come, come!"
Arjuna jumped down from the chariot
and, rushing forward overtook and held
Krishna, casting both his arms around
him. "Stop, Krishna," he cried. "Do not
break your pledge. You have promised not
to use weapons in this battle. This is my
work. I shall not fail. I shall send my
arrows and kill the beloved grandsire
myself. Pray, mount the car and take the
reins."
Arjuna took Krishna back and the battle
was resumed. The Pandava forces had
been handled roughly, but now the sun
was down in the west and the fighting
ended for the day.
