WITH joy the king received to his heart
and his kingdom the resplendent and
youthful prince Devavrata and crowned
him as the Yuvaraja, the heir apparent.
Four years went by. One day as the king
was wandering on the banks of the
Yamuna, the air was suddenly filled with
a fragrance so divinely sweet that the king
sought for its cause, and he traced it to a
maiden so lovely that she seemed a
goddess. A sage had conferred on her the
boon that a divine perfume should
emanate from her, and this was now
pervading the whole forest.
From the moment the goddess Ganga left
him, the king had kept his senses under
control, but the sight of this divinely
beautiful maiden burst the bonds of
restraint and filled him with an
overmastering desire. He asked her to be
his wife.
The maiden said: "I am a fisherwoman,
the daughter of the chief of the fishermen.
May it please you to ask him and get his
consent." Her voice was sweet as her
form.
The father was an astute man.
He said: "O king, there is no doubt that
this maiden, like every other, has to be
married to someone and you are indeed
worthy of her. Still you have to make a
promise to me before you can have her."
Santanu replied: "If it is a just promise I
shall make it."
The chief of the fisherfolk said: "The child
born of this maiden should be the king
after you."
Though almost mad with passion, the king
could not make this promise, as it meant
setting aside the godlike Devavrata, the
son of Ganga, who was entitled to the
crown.
It was a price that could not be thought of
without shame. He therefore returned to
his capital, Hastinapura, sick with baffled
desire. He did not reveal the matter to
anyone and languished in silence.
One day Devavrata asked his father: "My
father, you have all that your heart could
wish. Why then are you so unhappy? How
is it that you are like one pining away with
a secret sorrow?"
The king replied: "Dear son, what you say
is true. I am indeed tortured with mental
pain and anxiety. You are my only son
and you are always preoccupied with
military ambitions. Life in the world isuncertain and wars are incessant. If
anything untoward befalls you our family
will become extinct. Of course, you are
equal to a hundred sons. Still, those who
are well read in the scriptures say that in
this transitory world having but one son is
the same as having no son at all. It is, not
proper that the perpetuation of our family
should depends on a single life, and above
all things I desire the perpetuation of our
family. This is the cause of my anguish."
The father prevaricated, being ashamed to
reveal the whole story to his son.
Thewise Devavrata realised that there
must be a secret cause for the mental
condition of his father, and questioning
the king's charioteer came to know of his
meeting with the fishermaiden on the
banks of the Yamuna. He went to the
chief of the fishermen and besought his
daughter's hand on his father's behalf.
The fisherman was respectful, but firm:
"My daughter is indeed fit to be the king's
spouse. Then should not her son become
king? But you have been crowned as the
heir apparent and will naturally succeed
your father. It is this that stands in the
way."
Devavrata replied: "I give you my word
that the son born of this maiden shall be
king. And I renounce in his favor my right
as heir apparent," and he took a vow to
that effect.
The chief of the fishermen said: "O best of
the Bharata race, you have done what no
one else born of royal blood has you have
done till now. You are indeed a hero. You
can yourself conduct my daughter to the
king, your father. Still, hear with patience
these words of mine which I say as the
father of the girl.
"I have no doubt you will keep your word,
but how can I hope that the children born
of you will renounce their birthright?
Your sons will naturally be mighty heroes
like you, and will be hard to resist if they
seek to seize the kingdom by force. This is
the doubt that torments me."
When he heard this knotty question posed
by the girl's father, Devavrata, who was
bent on fulfilling the king's desire, made
his supreme renunciation. He vowed with
upraised arm to the father of the maiden:
"I shall never marry and I dedicate myself
to a life of unbroken chastity."
And as he uttered these words of
renunciation the gods showered flowers
on his head, and cries of "Bhishma,"
"Bhishma"
resounded
in
the
air.
"Bhishma" means one who undertakes a
terrible vow and fulfils it. That name
became the celebrated epithet of
Devavrata from that time. Then the son of
Ganga led the maiden Satyavati to his
father.
Two sons were born of Satyavati to
Santanu, Chitrangada and Vichitravirya,
who ascended the throne one after the
other. Vichitravirya had two sons,
Dhritarashtra
and
Pandu,
born
respectively of his two queens, Ambika
and Ambalika.
The sons of Dhritarashtra, a hundred in
number, were known as the Kauravas.
Pandu had five sons who became famous
as the Pandavas. Bhishma lived long,
honored by all as the grandsire until the
end of the famous battle of Kurukshetra.
