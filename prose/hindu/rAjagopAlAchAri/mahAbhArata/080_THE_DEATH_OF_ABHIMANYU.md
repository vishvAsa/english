title = "080 THE DEATH OF ABHIMANYU"

+++
THE Pandavas, proceeding according to
plan, had closely followed Abhimanyu
when he broke into the Kaurava
formation. But Dhritarashtra's son-in-law
Jayadratha, the gallant king of the
Sindhus, swooped down upon the
Pandavas with all his forces and enabled
the breach in the formation to be
effectively and solidly closed up, so that
the Pandavas found it impossible to force
their way in.
Yudhishthira hurled a javelin and cut
Jayadratha's bow. But in an instant, the
Saindhava took up another bow and sent
unerring shafts at Dharmaputra.
Bhimasena's arrows made deadly work,
crashing down the canopy and flagstaff of
Jayadratha's car. But the Saindhava, was
alert and rearmed himself, each time his
equipment was broken. He killed Bhima's
chariot horses, and the latter had to go into
Satyaki's car.
In this manner, Jayadratha, with stubborn
valor, prevented the Pandavas from
entering in Abhimanyu's wake. The young
hero was thus isolated and surrounded by
the Kaurava forces.The son of Subhadra was however
undaunted. He attacked all the warriors
around him and slew them in great
number. Like rivers losing themselves in
the ocean, the soldiers that went to attack
him, disappeared before his arrows. The
Kaurava army reeled under Abhimanyu's
onslaughts.
Duryodhana's son Lakshmana, a gallant
young
warrior,
then
charged
on
Abhimanyu. When they saw this,
retreating soldiers came back and
supported Lakshmana, showering arrows
on Abhimanyu, like rain falling on a hill.
Still, Arjuna's son was undaunted and, his
shaft came swift and shining, like a
serpent fresh-sloughed, and pierced
Lakshmana. The handsome youth, with
beautiful nose and eyebrows and hair, lay
dead on the field and the Kaurava soldiers
were filled with grief.
"To hell with the wicked Abhimanyu,"
shouted Duryodhana, and the six great
warriors,
Dorna,
Kripa,
Karna,
Aswatthama, Brihatbala and Kritavarma
closed upon Abhimanyu.
"It is impossible to pierce this youth's
armor," said Drona to Karna. "Aim at the
reins of his horses and cut them off.
Disable him thus and attack him from
behind."
The son of Surya did accordingly.
Abhimanyu's bow was broken by a shaft
discharged from behind. His horses and
charioteer were killed. Thus disabled, the
young warrior stood on the field, with
sword and shield, facing his enemies.
As he stood dauntless like kshatriya
dharma incarnate, he filled the warriors
around with amazement. Whirling his
sword, he held his own against the
numerous warriors who had surrounded
him, with a skill that confounded them.
It seemed to them as if his feet did not rest
on earth and he was on wings, in the air.
Drona sent a shaft that broke Abhimanyu's
sword. Karna's sharp arrows tore his
shield into bits.
Then Abhimanyu bent down and taking
up one of his chariot wheels and whirling
it like a discus, stood up facing all the
enemies that surrounded him.
The dust from the chariot wheel covered
him and the poet says it enhanced the
natural beauty of the young hero. He
fought fiercely like a second Vishnu with
the discus.
But soon, the combined onslaught of the
warriors
that
surrounded
him
overpowered him. The chariot wheel was
shattered to pieces. The son of Duhsasana
came up then and closed with him in
mortal combat.
Both went down together but Duhsasana's
son rose again and, while Abhimanyu was
struggling to his feet, struck him with his
mace and killed him.
"Subhadra's son who, like an elephant in a
lily pond, single-handed worked havoc in
the Kaurava army, was thus overpowered
by numbers and killed cruelly," said
Sanjaya to Dhritarashtra.
"And, having killed him, your people
danced around his dead body like savage
hunters exulting over their prey. All good
men in the army were grieved and tears
rolled from their eyes. Even the birds of
prey, that circled overhead making noises
seemed to cry 'Not thus!' 'Not thus!' "
While there was blowing of conchs and
cries of victory all over the Kaurava army,
Yuyutsu, the son of Dhritarashtra, did not
approve of all this. "This is ignoble," he
angrily cried.
"Soldiers, you have forgotten your code.
Verily, you should be ashamed but,
instead, you shout brazen cries of victory.
Having committed a most wicked deed,
you revel in foolish joy, blind to the
danger that is imminent."
So saying, Yuyutsu threw his weapon
away in disgust and left the battlefield.This young son of Dhritarashtra feared
sin. His words were not sweet in the
Kaurava ears, but he was a good man and
spoke out his mind.
