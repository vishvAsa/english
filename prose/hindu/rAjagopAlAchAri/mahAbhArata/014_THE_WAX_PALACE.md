THE jealousy of Duryodhana began to
grow at the sight of the physical strength
of Bhima and the dexterity of Arjuna.
Karna and Sakuni became Duryodhana's
evil
counsellors
in
planning
wily
stratagems.
As for poor Dhritarashtra, he was a wise
man no doubt and he also loved his
brother's sons, but he was weak of will
and dotingly attached to his own children.
For his children's sake the worse became
the better reason, and he would sometimes
even knowingly follow the wrong path.
Duryodhana sought in various ways to kill
the Pandavas. It was by means of the
secret help rendered by Vidura who
wanted to save the family from a great sin,
that the Pandavas escaped with their lives.
One unforgivable offence of the Pandavas
in the eyes of Duryodhana was that the
people of the city used to praise them
openly and declare in season and out of
season that Yudhishthira alone was fit to
be the king.
They would flock together and argue:
"Dhritarashtra could never be king for he
was born blind. It is not proper that he
should now hold the kingdom in his
hands. Bhishma cannot be king either,
because he is devoted to truth and to his
vow that he would not be a king. Hence
Yudhishthira alone should be crowned as
king. He alone can rule the Kuru race and
the kingdom with justice." Thus people
talked everywhere. These words were
poison to Duryodhana's ears, and made
him writhe and burn with jealousy.He went to Dhritarashtra and complained
bitterly of the public talk: "Father, the
citizens babble irrelevant nonsense. They
have no respect even for such venerable
persons as Bhishma and yourself. They
say
that
Yudhishthira
should
be
immediately crowned king. This would
bring disaster on us. You were set aside
because of your blindness, and your
brother became the king. If Yudhishthira
is to succeed his father, where do we
come? What chance has our progeny?
After Yudhishthira his son, and his son's
son, and then his son will be the kings.
We will sink into poor relations dependent
on them even for our food. To live in hell
would be better than that!"
At these words, Dhritarashtra began to
ponder and said: "Son, what you say is
true. Still Yudhishthira will not stray from
the path of virtue. He loves all. He has
truly inherited all the excellent virtues of
his deceased father. People praise him and
will support him, and all the ministers of
the State and commanders of armies, to
whom Pandu had endeared himself by his
nobility of character, will surely espouse
his cause. As for the people, they idolise
the Pandavas. We cannot oppose them
with any chance of success. If we do
injustice, the citizens will rise in
insurrection and either kill us or expel us.
We shall only cover ourselves with
ignominy."
Duryodhana replied: "Your fears are
baseless. Bhishma will at worst be neutral,
while Ashwatthama is devoted to me,
which means that his father Drona and
uncle Kripa will also be on our side.
Vidura cannot openly oppose us, if for no
other reason, because he has not the
strength. Send the Pandavas immediately
to Varanavata. I tell you the solemn truth
that my cup of suffering is full and I can
bear no more. It pierces my heart and
renders me sleepless and makes my life a
torment. After sending the Pandavas to
Varanavata we shall try to strengthen our
party."
Later, some politicians were prevailed
upon to join Duryodhana's party and
advise the king in the matter. Kanika, the
minister of Sakuni, was their leader. "O
king," he said, "guard yourselves against
the sons of Pandu, for their goodness and
influence are a menace to you and yours.
The Pandavas are the sons of your
brother, but the nearer the kin, the closer
and deadlier the danger. They are very
strong."
Sakuni's minister continued: "Be not
wroth with me if I say a king should be
mighty in action as in name, for nobody
will believe in strength which is never
displayed. State affairs should be kept
secret and the earliest indication to the
public, of a wise plan, should be its
execution. Also, evils must be eradicated
promptly for a thorn which has been
allowed to remain in the body may cause
a festering wound. Powerful enemies
should be destroyed and even a weak foe
should not be neglected since a mere
spark, if over looked, may cause a forest
fire. A strong enemy should be destroyed
by means of stratagem and it would be
folly to show mercy to him. O king, guard
yourself against the sons of Pandu. They
are very powerful."
Duryodhana told Dhritarashtra of his
success in securing adherents: "I have
bought the goodwill of the king's
attendants with gifts of wealth and honor.
I have won over his ministers to our
cause. If you will adroitly prevail upon the
Pandavas to go to Varanavata, the city and
the whole kingdom will take our side.
They will not have a friend left here. Once
the kingdom has become ours, there will
be no power for harm left in them, and it
may even be possible to let them come
back."When many began to say what he himself
wished to believe, Dhritarashtra's mind
was shaken and he yielded to his sons'
counsels. It only remained to give effect
to the plot.
The ministers began to praise the beauty
of Varanavata in the hearing of the
Pandavas and made mention of the fact
that a great festival in honor of Siva
would be conducted there with all pomp
and splendor.
The unsuspecting Pandavas were easily
persuaded, especially when Dhritarashtra
also told them in tones of great affection
that they should certainly go and witness
the festivities, not only because they were
worth seeing but because the people of the
place were eager to welcome them.
The Pandavas took leave of Bhishma and
other elders and went to Varanavata.
Duryodhana was elated. He plotted with
Karna and Sakuni to kill Kunti and her
sons at Varanavata. They sent for
Purochana, a minister, and gave him
secret instructions which he bound
himself to carry out faithfully.
Before the Pandavas proceeded to
Varanavata, Purochana, true to his
instructions, hastened to the spot well in
advance and had a beautiful palace built
for their reception. Combustible materials
like jute, lac, ghee, oil, and fat were used
in the construction of the palace. The
materials for the plastering of the walls
were also inflammable. He skilfully filled
up various parts of the building with dry
things that could catch fire easily, and had
inviting seats and bedsteads disposed at
the most combustible places.
Every convenience was furnished for the
Pandavas to dwell in the city without fear,
until the palace was built. When the
Pandavas had settled down in the wax
house, the idea was to set fire to it at night
when they were sound asleep.
The ostentatious love and solicitude with
which the Pandavas had been received
and treated would obviate all suspicion
and the fire would be taken as a sad case
of pure accident. No one would dream of
blaming the Kauravas.
