Men are targets of Love J_had as much as women are! A colleague’s younger brother worked in fashion industry. Let’s call him Ashish. He worked with a European brand making denim. There he met a young woman- let’s call her Shaheen.

Shaheen came across as liberal Mz. Loved Gujarati food which Ashish’s baa sent for him. Slowly she found place in his circle. They were seen together. The family was not conservative & thought this was merely a casual liking, they were sure Ashish would not go beyond friendship.

One day Ashish brought Shaheen to his sister’s (my friend) office and asked her for money. They quickly left. It was unclear what was that urgency was. My friend found the truth much later..when it was to late!

All friends were told that the Gujarati family decided to accept Shaheen as their bahu. But on the day of wedding Shaheen didn’t turn up. She called; her mother had locked her in room as Ashish had not converted yet &special marriage act would not be enough. She wanted nikahanama. Ashish was asked to convert, if he wanted to meet Shaheen. Before anyone could respond Ashish accepted Izlam. The next day he read Nikah. My friend & her husband are educated respectable business family- it was a shock to see their youngest brother suddenly fade out.

The couple decided to take a break from all explanations so they booked a vacation to US. For the first time they taste the freedom of no questions asked. No one was able to recognise them unlike their neighbourhood in Mithibai College. They decided not to return. Continued to live as illegal migrants. But to remain under the radar they needed some support. The newly converted Ashish was now known as Adil. The preachers in peaceful neighbourhoods advised & helped them with ways to settle illegally. Adil without his necessary documents could not get employment so he did menial work. Became close to Mz community of preachers & peacefuls who came from Egypt, Morocco, Damascus, all places which on map are popular for the sword of radical faith. His close proximity to the puritanical clergy hardened his thoughts & sensitivity. Shaheen now a mother of a girl child decided that she no longer wanted to live with a radical Izlamist that Ashish had now turned to be.

She decided to divorce him.
Thus the marriage between Ashish & Shaheen ended…for which Ashish abandoned his old Baa, his sister and bother gave up his career & home in Mumbai. The only place that opened arms for him was the local preachers & the peaceful ghettos

Now Ashish is Adil. Living without valid papers to work,stay, get healthcare…his wife. Shaheen has moved on with his daughter. He has no job as he wants to work only where he can offer all 5 prayers. He is halala husband to Mz women who have issues in resettling as per Shariah My colleague met him during her visit ..and was horrified to find his clothes torn, beard long over grown. He drives Uber-to be able to be at prayer on time. While leaving he advised his sister to convert along with her husband & children. He is completely radicalised.

Ashish’s urgency of borrowing money was revealed much later. My colleague found that Shaheen repeatedly terminated pregnancies. Some crimes are more serious than mu₹der one such-converting to Izlam but manipulating emotions. Bcoz straight mind would never accept this war manual
