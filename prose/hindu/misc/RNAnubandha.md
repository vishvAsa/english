Consequences of bad karma, real life example of account balance, the reasons for accepting the kārmika backfire. Ṛṇānubandhana in jyotiśa, how it works

## Abduction
In 2009, my cousin who was a senior gynaecologist was attending my wife. My wife delivered a healthy girl over 4 kg. However, the paediatrician over there just told us that my child is suffering from acute pneumonia and she needs to be operated immediately (There was no symptoms and my sister countered him but she cannot to do anything as he was the paediatrician). Before I could do anything, he called an ambulance from a five-star “hotel” and before we could say anything my daughter was literally abducted. My sister and me followed the ambulance to the hotel.

She was operated there and we were forced to sign the forms. I was still happy because I was passing through Sade-Sati and so was my daughter. It was my fate. My sister who is a senior surgeon and very honest lady, was shocked to see the new medical mafia. Anyway, I told her to leave, as I felt she won’t be able to bear the bad things. (She was actually crying when she met those soul less people who can operate a just born baby for leeching money).

Four days have passed in that hotel and the receptionist became friendly. He told me that I should leave the hotel, as the chief hotelier has laid down a rule to charge a minimum 5k to 6k everyday from every person. (General room service). He was right, I was charged exactly the same amount. Anyway, I also met a very poor farmer over there. He sold his land for 2.6 million for his twin daughters. He had already spent 1.73 in just three days. He was crying outside the window. Looking at his daughters, he was murmuring in local lingo. He was wishing for their death. My own pain did not pinch me, but this was the last straw.

## Release
I met the chief hotelier, but he refused to relieve my baby. Then I called the DC and he called the hotelier. The hotelier was perturbed and blurted out on me. He warned me not to influence him with powerful and mighty. However, after five days I was able to release my daughter. No doubt, my bank account received a blow. I did not have much at that time. However, I did not curse anybody. Whenever I looked at my daughter’s smiling face, I considered everything as fate. Śanideva was happy on me and was relieving me of my own bad karma.

## CONSEQUENCES

In 2017, some female called me for meeting. She came with her husband and a beautiful baby boy. Somehow, I felt that I have seen him earlier. Then the realization dawned on me, but I did not say anything. They were sent by devī, so I had to follow the orders.

Their son was 2.5 years old (They had only one baby and that too on the border of 40s and 50s), and he was so different and spiritual that I made him sit near me. I gave him sweets which I had kept for children (He was not my enemy).

His horoscope was shown. Two of the kālapuruṣa ānga were in very bad shape. His longevity was marred with alpāyu yogas and RK axis showed the kārmika backfire. His father’s chart (the chief hotelier) carried the ṛṇānubandhana yoga. I understood that the boy is going to take revenge and that was the reason for his charm (how will you love someone without the charm. How will you bear the pain without love ?)

The boy’s horoscope pointed towards a ventricular septal defect (VSD) of very large size. The paediatrician was aware of this. I knew what was going to happen. I could have blurted out or told him that he is suffering today because of how he had treated others, though I kept mum. In fact, I was pained to see the child’s face.

I told them to perform Ṃahamrtyoonjay though it was not going to save him.

The chief hotelier lost the child. He is still running the hotel although the event has not changed his attitude.
God would be wondering how to teach a lesson to such people who did not even carry a soul.
