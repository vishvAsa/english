A colleague‚Äôs younger brother worked in fashion industry. Let‚Äôs call him Ashish. He worked with a European brand making denim. There he met a young woman- let‚Äôs call her Shaheen.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Shaheen came across as liberal Mz. Loved Gujarati food which Ashish‚Äôs baa sent for him. Slowly she found place in his circle. They were seen together. The family was not conservative &amp;amp; thought this was merely a casual liking, they were sure Ashish would not go beyond friendship.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

The first guru was Bhairavi Brahmani.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Sri Ramakrishna, by his own desire to realize the various forms of God, practised the well-known ways of reaching out to the realization of God. But because of the physical and mental symptoms that he developed everyone around him thought that he had gone mad. And therefore there was great anguish in the hearts of those who knew him and loved him, to cure him. They were trying to find out remedies to get him out of his ‚ÄúGod madness‚Äù. This phenomenon also was not unknown in India. &amp;hellip; Bhairavi Brahmani tried to convince him that he was not suffering from any disease. But because others would not believe this, he would cry and keep running to the Mother and ask her why she was putting him through this.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

My wife delivered a healthy girl over 4 kg. However, the paediatrician over there just told us that my child is suffering from acute pneumonia and she needs to be operated immediately (There was no symptoms and my sister countered him but she cannot to do anything as he was the paediatrician). Before I could do anything, he called an ambulance from a five-star ‚Äúhotel‚Äù and before we could say anything my daughter was literally abducted. My sister and me followed the ambulance to the hotel.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;I think I am the most appropriate women to answer this as I am a Sikh women married to a Muslim man for last 28 yrs in the state of Madhya Pradesh. We got married in year 1990. For understandable reasons you can excuse me for not coming up with my real name as being a mother of one daughter and son at this age I would like to keep my identity intact. But I have to tell my story and I think this is the most appropriate forum to make my views public.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We are two sisters only and younger one is married to a Hindu man, it all started from me as I did my thing of marrying my ‚Äòlove‚Äô hence it became difficult for parents to say no to my younger sister for another inter-faith marriage as she too went ahead with marrying her love.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

This is a deeply painful personal thread. My personal life, in contrast to my business life, has been a long tragedy. Autism destroyed our lives and left me suicidally depressed.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;My wife Pramila and I were in this fight against autism for over 15 years. She is a super mom and her passionate cause is curing our son of autism. I worked hard along with her. To ensure his safety, I also took some of his treatments so I could know what they did to him.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
