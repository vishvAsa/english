      <description>&lt;p&gt;Source: &lt;a href=&#34;https://threadreaderapp.com/user/BhagwaanUvacha&#34;&gt;TW&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Will be a long one so wont do it in one go though. Dheere Dheere darr ko badhana hain, hadd se guzar jaana hain. For entertainment purposes only. Usual disclaimers apply. Ready?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So this is a story that happens in a 3 BHK house in Mumbai, around the 80s. The family consisted of a father, mother, two sisters, and their grandmother (mother’s mother). Granny was very old and virtually bed ridden. The daughters were between 14 and 17 years old. Granny spent the entire day in her room lying on the bed and chanting some mantra that no one could really make out. The younger daughter used to bring lunch and dinner for granny everyday and sat chatting with her till she finished. Sometimes the elder daughter did this.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
