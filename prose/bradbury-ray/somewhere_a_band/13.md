*Many tourists arriving. I must welcome them. Questions at breakfast.*

*Nef.*

He ran down to the rail station and stood in the middle of the blazing hot iron tracks, daring the whistle to sound again. But this time, silence.

Separate trains bringing what? he wondered.

There were boarders in every window, waiting. “It’s all right,” he called. “It was nothing.”

Someone called down from above, quietly, “Are you *sure*?”
