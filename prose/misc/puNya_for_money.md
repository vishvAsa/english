title = "puNya for money"
+++

About a hundred years ago, a distant relative of Rāḻḻapalli Ananthakrishna Sarma had once gone on a pilgrimage to Kāśī and other places. When he was in Mathura or in some other place, he had completely spent all his money. It was not easy in those times to procure money by writing a letter back home.

With no other option, he went to one of the pawn-broker shops and requested the lender, “I need some money now. I will be able to repay your money once I return home. I don’t have any item to pledge in your favour. However, I have visited Kāśī, Prayāga, and other holy places. You may accept the puṇya [loosely, ‘merit gathered by good deeds’] that I have gained by visiting those holy places as the pledge and loan me some money.”

This was acceptable to the merchant. At once, he gave him the money he needed.

Upon returning to his hometown, he immediately repaid the money along with some interest by sending the merchant a thanking note. He got the following reply – “I do not need your money. I would rather keep the puṇya that you deposited with me.” That gentleman wrote another letter insisting, “I cannot part with my puṇya. Kindly accept the money.” After a few more correspondences, the money was repaid after much persuasion.

Sarma narrated this story to me while explaining the amount of trust men had in each other during those times.
