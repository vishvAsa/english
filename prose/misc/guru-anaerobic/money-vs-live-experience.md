Car Insurance

We were walking along a coastal cliff path and he was talking about car
insurance.

Past the mauve poppy. "I found a good deal for my car insurance.”  
Past the blue argus butterfly. “So, I transferred from my old provider.”  
Past the sweet pea. “I've saved £250.”  
Past the flattened grass where the rabbits run. “And the no-claims bonus is better.”  
Past hundreds of dandelions. “I've got a nose for a good offer.”  

Sunlight reflecting off the sea.  
We were walking along 5-mile beach and he was talking about his job.  
Past the mermaid's purse. “It looks like I'm going to get the promotion I told you about."  
Past splintered spider-crab shells. “I deserve it as I've worked my butt off.”  
Past the sea buckthorn. “It's good to be recognised for the work I put in.”  
Past the washed-up smooth hound with no eyes. “In five years' time I could be head of the south-eastern office.”  
Underneath circling terns. “My boss said I'm a key part of the team.”  

The waves rolling to the shore.
