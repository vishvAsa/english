Crossroads  

Souls do not depart,  
Only their ways.+++(4)+++  

When shadows devour the face,  
Laughter lingers,  
Like a distant echo.  

Picking up a few pieces,  
Of the looks or the smiles,  
From the shores of the vanishing point,  
And failing to assemble an image,  
Enlivens half-memories,  
Of half-kindled love,  
Of half-walked journey,  
Touching the heart-core,  
With a sweet agony.  

Only the ways depart,  
And faces vanish,  
But tears linger with heartbeats.  
Also the echoes from the past.
