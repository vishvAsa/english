title = "Firefly"

Retaining the vanishing shadows,  
From the nostalgic past,  
As her image descends to oblivion.

Striving to capture a moment,  
Before it melts like a snowflake.  

Seizing the moment of collecting the pieces,  
Of the glass that once mirrored her,  
Suspending pulsation,  
the beats of aham,  
Being there to capture the last simulation.

I have not waited enough,  
For eternity spreads incessantly,  
With floating particles like me.  
Just a tiny firefly in the tempest.
