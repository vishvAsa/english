Apara

In the night of the new moon,  
Assuming the dark body of Apara,  
Hidden in the dark,  
With disheveled deep dark hair.  
You think you are hidden from me!  

Stop this hide and seek game,  
You lack the skills to hide yourself,  
As your eyes,  
like the lakes filled with love,  
Shine like the moon and the sun,  
Revealing all the realms.
