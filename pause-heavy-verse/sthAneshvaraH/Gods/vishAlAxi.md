Vishalakshi  

A hermit in Banaras told me the first day,  
"You come here to learn, or to die."  
Seeing me intrigued,  
He added, "and they are one and the same."  

Perplexed, I strolled through the cremation grounds,  
Inhaling the air infused with the aroma of flesh.  
First death came with Vedanta,  
With realization that the I that went there was no more.  

And came the Sautrantikas+++(??)+++,  
Pushing my being to annihilation.  

Thanks to the Trika Shaivas,  
For letting me regain a new self,  
That I saved by running away,  
Mortified by the gaze of Vishalakshi,  
As she haunted my dreams,  
While I chanted her names.  

The big eyed one,  
Summons me again,  
Rekindling the desire to learn,  
The mysteries of her magical gaze.  

May be this time,  
I will have the courage,  
To bear with her laughter,  
And embrace Mahakala with grace,  
And gently tell the devotees,  
We both worship the same God,  
You call him Rama and I call her Rāmā.
