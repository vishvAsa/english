Life  

In the beginning was just night,  
Enveloped by the thicket of dark,  
A spark called life,  
An ephemeral emanation.+++(5)+++  

We crashed from nowhere,  
Being in the middle of a saga,  
Waking against a tempest,  
In a sinking ship.+++(5)+++  

Close our eyes to avoid monsters,  
For shadows have us owned,  
Flickering spark in the midst,  
Confronts this mighty dark.  

One last laugh,  
One last sport,  
One last gaze,  
And shadows take over.+++(5)+++
