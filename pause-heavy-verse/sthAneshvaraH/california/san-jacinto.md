San Jacinto

Just because I have not seen you for a while,  
Have not touched your outcrops,  
Mixed my breath with yours,  
And listened to the songs in your garden,  
Do not think a minute goes by not thinking about you.

If not for this lockdown,  
I would have grabbed my hiking stick,  
And would have jumped up and down,  
Your hills and valleys,  
And birds would have followed me,  
Singing in chorus with my whistles,  
You won't have been left alone,  
For I will have to breathe,  
My final breaths,  
In your soothing company.
