The Summit  

It was a day hike,  
Started before the sunrise,  
When birds were singing the first Sama,  
With first libation to their belly-fire.+++(5)+++

I crossed the same river many times,  
Or may be different rivers once each,+++(5)+++  
For the slopes were confusing,  
Carved with countless hills.  

It was a walk without a destination,  
Aimless strolling,  
And some friends showed me the summit,  
That gave meaning to their hike.+++(5)+++  

I made some friends and lost some,  
In every fork as we climbed,  
Making me forgetful,  
That the path was for me to take.+++(4)+++  

I doubted half the day,  
If the summit was even there,  
And climbed half the day,  
To touch the peak before the sunset.  

When the golden rays touched the peaks,  
And the birds were flying back,  
The summit was within reach.  

I thought it was enough,  
As the summit was not my dream,  
This was not for me to touch,  
My eyes are made to see it up,  
And not beneath my feet.+++(5)+++  

I thought while returning,  
All I wanted was just a hike,  
The summit was an illusion.+++(5)+++
