wait  

As the sun pierces through the screen,  
And caresses my skin,  
Or the soothing moonbeam,  
I realize,  
All the great ones come to me.+++(5)+++  

I would be long dead,  
Had I to go find air to breathe,  
Or even space and time.  

Now my friend  
I suspend my journey  
In quest for the truth.  
All the great ones come to me.
