Sunset  

Inspire me! says Dirghatamas,  
Gazing upon the setting sun,  
In the world that he has not seen,  
Having been born blind.  

Seeing the world, a riddle,  
A puzzle, more than a paradox,  
We are our own riddle,+++(5)+++  
Like the seer who was blind.  

Staying awake in the dark,  
And seeing darkness in the light,  
He seeks to be inspired,  
By the setting sun,  
That never touched his eyes.+++(4)+++
