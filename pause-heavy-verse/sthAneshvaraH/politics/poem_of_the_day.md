Leaders come and go,  
Prophets come and go,  
Even God incarnates again and again,  
It is the humanity that I am worried about.

Seasons change as the Fall or the Spring,  
Youth is not granted forever and ever,  
Those drunken with grief or ecstasy,  
Shall not compromise decency forever.

I naively strolled out of my university hostel,  
And landed in a historic museum behind the forest,  
And entered with curiosity, waiting in line,  
Not knowing, I had entered Buchenwald concentration camp.

I did not read histories like you did,  
Or sociology or politics for that matter.  
As a student of Sanskrit,  
All I knew was Bhartrhari and Madhusudana.  

I woke up that night being chased by shadows,  
Dragging me to the enclosure.  
I was bleeding and crying,  
Oh horror, that lasted for days and months.

My friends, you have won,  
You have my congratulations,  
Just pause for a minute,  
And rethink your victory.
