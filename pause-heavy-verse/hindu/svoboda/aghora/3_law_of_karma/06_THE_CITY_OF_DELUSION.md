AS BOMBAY'S IMPORTANCE in my life accelerated I increasingly under stood why Vimalananda had had to leave his life of many years as a itinerant sadhu and resettle in his hometown. Bombay was so crowded for him with tangled heaps of rnanubandhanas that nothing less than physical residence there would suffice for their unravelling. People daily arrived at his doorstep to confront him with shopping lists of cravings to be satisfied, but few of these solicitants showed any concern for him or his condition. Most were lit tle more than embodied karmic debts who were striving to entrap him, and few of this group appreciated interference from his own Jaya and Vijaya (Roshni and me). Fortunately none of them possessed the power of the San atkumaras, or their curses would have kept Vimalananda busy preventing his doorkeepers from falling deep into Patala. Roshni's strategies and protocols may have differed from mine but our ends were the same: to preserve as much as possible of Vimalananda's energy from being suckled from him by these smarmy vampires and to keep conditions in the flat from going com pletely cattywampus. 

Vimalananda's spiritual “children,” except for Parekh, usually came to glean wisdom from him by night. The day's callers were of a more mundane genre: a continuous and occasionally entertaining parade of musicians, as trologers, doctors, lawyers, businessmen, politicians, impostors, vagabonds, wastrels and cranks, all seeking some species of profit. Many of them were experts in their fields, like Sayed Sahib, an Arab who occasionally introduced Vimalananda to oil sheiks. When I first met Sayed Saheb two enormous glass jars had just been delivered to Vimalananda's residence. Sayed Saheb spent most of his hour there eyeing the jars as if trying to figure out how much he could make by selling them. When he finally left I asked Vimalananda who he was.

Aghora III: The Law of Karma 

"Sayed Saheb? Oh my, as a con man he's tops! You've heard of people in California and Florida back in the '30s selling people a tract of scrub forest and calling it an orange grove? People talk about such things, but Sayed Sa heb has actually done it, right here in India. He actually painted lemons on the trees in order to do it! 

"His most successful swindle was the way he separated the Saudis from their jewelry. Some members of the Saudi royal family wanted to quietly dis pose of some family treasure; Sayed Saheb assured them that he easily could handle the transaction in Bombay, no questions asked. 

“The Saudis flew into India in their private plane and landed at a small air strip south of Bombay. Sayed Saheb had arranged everything; all they had to do was hand over the gems and take the cash and off they would fly again. Now here they were on the runway, the Saudis with their jewel cases and Sayed Saheb with a suitcase full of money, which he opened to show them that there was no hanky-panky going on. 

"All at once there was a clamor of sirens. 'It's the police!' shouted Sayed Sa hib as two jeeps filled with his accomplices brandishing guns sped toward the plane. As Sayed Sahib grabbed the baubles he thrust his suitcase into the hands of the startled Arabs and told them, 'Quick, take the money and fly!' Which is what they did, and once they were in the air and headed back to safety what did they find when they opened that case? Newspaper! Bundles and bundles of newspaper cut to the appropriate size, with a 100-rupee note on top and on bottom to make the bundles look legitimate." 

"They must have been pretty irate." 

"Irate! If they had ever been able to locate Sayed Sahib they would have dis membered him, after first flaying him alive. But he was lucky, and he escaped that time too." 

"So his good karmas haven't completely run out yet." 

“Not yet.” And probably they would not, so long as he kept Vimalananda happy. Sayed Saheb also pursued legitimate businesses. He always insisted on giving Vimalananda a cut of the money that he made from a sheik who had been impressed with Vimalananda's talents. A pattern developed: Sayed Sa heb would offer, and Vimalananda would demur. Then Sayed Saheb would tarry until Vimalananda left the room for some reason and would then hide a bundle of bank notes for us to find later, Easter-egg-like. 

Another of Vimalananda's associates, Sidi Saheb, used his restaurant as a cover for his various less-than-legal activities. I appreciated Sidi Saheb for teaching me the approved Bombay way of politely handing a cigarette or chil lum to another smoker by using three fingers. Vimalananda did not appreci ate it when from time to time Sidi Saheb would try to test him by bringing 

184 

The City of Delusion 

him some marijuana or hashish laced with arsenic, aconite or some other poisonous intensifier. Vimalananda would smoke it and be troubled by the mixture for a while, but he would send most of the noxious effect to Sidi Sa heb, who would land in the hospital for a few days as a result. This would temporarily calm him down. 

Sidi Saheb, who was a great worshipper of Shiva, built next to his restaurant a Shiva temple with a full-time priest to perform worship there. When the priest was discovered in flagrante delicto with a woman inside the temple there was a hue and cry whose volume increased the next morning when the priest's dismembered body was found inside the shrine. “Lord Shiva became angry at his fornication and punished him," was the explanation. It was rumored that when Sidi Saheb would put out a contract on a rival he would arrange to have the victim's corpse cooked into a curry which he would then feed, with due philanthropic fanfare, to the widows and orphans of the community. The poor loved Sidi Saheb, the police hated him, and his rivals feared him. To Roshni and me he was just one more act in the ongoing Vimalananda Circus. 

One performer in that extravaganza whom I found personally distasteful was Shantilal the musician. Though he was a talented singer his speaking voice was almost as obnoxious as his personality, which grated through a paan-stained face that looked like nothing so much as a deteriorating jack-o' lantern. I was easily peeved by the arrogance in his voice when he talked to me. It did nothing for my mood that every time he arrived I was forced to go downstairs and fetch him a cup of specially-prepared cardamom tea. I came to resent this service. When the ringmaster noticed my attitude he quickly set me straight. 

“What are you so upset about?” Vimalananda asked with some vexation. “Your rnanubandhana with Shantilal requires you to minister to him. You are merely paying him back. Is that such a big deal? Pay him back now and get it over with if you don't want to have to come back and take care of it later. Besides, he is an interesting case study. Think about him for a moment. He is a walking hospital. Right now his main problem is arthritic knees. Modern medicine can give him relief in a few days, but within a couple of weeks he will relapse. Ayurveda would cure his problem permanently, but it would take at least six months and he wants quick results. 

“Now, I am interested in helping Shantilal because I too have a rnanu bandhana with him. Forget past lifetimes; I owe him from when he helped me out at a very critical period in this lifetime. When my son Ranu died I had no money to cremate him. Shantilal had just been paid for some singing he had done and when he saw how miserable I was he gave me his whole pay check. Only then I could burn my son. I paid Shantilal back afterwards, of 

185 

Aghora III: The Law of Karma 

course, but how can I forget that at a critical period in my life he was there to help me out? Other people might forget, but I cannot. I cannot adequately pay him back with money when his gift to me was more than mere money. Even Ranu, wherever he may be, still owes Shantilal a little something for ar ranging to dispose of his old body. 

“I must pay Shantilal back for the sincere, compassionate love he showed in helping me out in time of need, but I don't want to take his karmas on my self. The main cause of his arthritis is a whore he has been visiting. He spends his money on that whore instead of on his family. Because of too frequent sex his ojas is very low and his joints have become weak. Too much sex usually hits you first in the knees. 

“I have tried to persuade Shantilal to give this woman up. Even Nature has tried: Once when they were in bed together they were both burned, as if by a cigarette, in their private parts. But nothing has worked. Meanwhile, I have to think of the Law of Karma. Even though I don't approve of his activities I still owe him this rna. Healing him helps me pay off the rna, and I am interested in dying with a clean balance sheet. 

"I think that the best way to handle this situation is to locate a spirit who has some rnanubandhana with Shantilal. The spirit of Shantilal's father, who was very unhappy because he could not see his son before he died, will do nicely. Now that he has become a spirit, he is ethereal and can enter Shanti lal's body without Shantilal's knowledge. When? Near dawn, when Shantilal will be in a deep, deep sleep. Then, because the old man is in an ethereal form he can literally 'blow the impurities out of the body, from the knee joints to begin with. Gradually, Shantilal's entire body can be cured. 

"Now, Shantilal is still wasting his energy with that prostitute, so he may recreate his arthritis again—which will be his problem. Meanwhile he gets what he wants, which is relief. His father gets what he wants, which is to be with his son again. And I am also happy, because my rnanubandhana with Shantilal is settled without any overt action on my part.” 

Vimalananda shook his head. “Unfortunately Shantilal has never been able to prosper by knowing me. Last year I finally forced him to sing Kedara Raga for me, and now he has for some unknown reason started going on pilgrim ages to all the holy places, which he has never done before. In fact, he has be come so 'holy' that when I told him I was thinking of going to visit the States again he told me, 'Why do you want to go to that land of sex and meat-eaters? What is wrong with our own country?' He forgets that I have seen much of our own country while he was busy all during his life enjoying illicit sex. 

“He doesn't ask himself why he has suddenly started going on pilgrimages, because he is too egotistical to do so. But he should think about it. He doesn't 

186 

The City of Delusion 

have sense enough to think of such a thing himself, preoccupied as he has been with women and what is underneath their saris. His mind is being forc ibly turned towards God, so that at least when he dies he may remember God. That will give him at least a chance for a good rebirth—ante matih sa gatih--no matter what sort of evil karmas he may have done in this life.” 

“Pilgrimages are good then?" "Very good." "Is this why saints go on pilgrimages?" 

“No, a good saint's mind is already turned in God's direction. Saints go on pilgraimge mainly to enjoy the presence of their beloved deities, and to pu rify the pilgrimage places where their Beloveds live." 

"Which need to be purified after people like Shantilal visit them." 

“Unfortunately, yes. Hence the theft of King Krishnadevaraya's emeralds from that temple in the South." 

If I rarely welcomed Shantilal's advent I was inevitably delighted when Chotu, one of Vimalananda's oldest friends, would present himself at the door. Once arrived Chotu would roost with us for the day, ruminating over old times in Vimalananda's dairy and at his rock quarry. Like the day when Vimalananda nearly killed himself in a runaway truck; or the time when he was experimenting with explosives and accidentally sent a multi-ton rock scudding through the air like a cannonball all the way to the next island. 

Roshni and Chotu used to be bridge partners when they played against Vi malananda and Mamrabahen. One day the two of them connived to stack the deck in such a way that they bid and made a little slam. Vimalananda, at first skeptical, became furious when they divulged their secret. Then he shuf fled the cards himself, and thumped them down on the table. He had Chotu cut the deck and Roshni deal, and as soon as he picked up his hand he laid down a grand slam. Then he asked them how they liked it. 

Chotu would always demand to be fed when he came, and Vimalananda would always oblige with his usual brilliant cookery. Vimalananda loved to cook, and fed his Beloved through the mouths of whatever people, animals, or plants might be handy. One memorable Vimalananda monologue began on such a day, when lunch preparations had just begun. Vimalananda was just saying, “There is no escaping the Law of Karma. Your karmas may pro vide Dr. Shantilal Mehta, India's premier surgeon, to care for you, or they may give you Dr. Gomes," when Chotu began to cackle. 

“Dr. Gomes?”I enquired 

"Dr. Gomes,” explained Chotu,"was the manager of the rock quarry. He really handled the labor very well, but he was almost always drunk. Most of the time when the boss here would send me out to look for Gomes I would 

187 

Aghora III: The Law of Karma 

find him lying senseless in the gutter. Having him as a manager was conve nient because he would treat the workers for free. Every injection he would give them would develop into an injection abscess, so when we would see la borers walking around rubbing their arms we would know that Gomes had been up to his tricks again." 

At this point the doorbell rang and in flounced Miss Motibahen Bamb hani, toting as usual her multiple containers of home-cooked lunch. None of us cared for Motibahen, not even Vimalananda, but giving proper respect to the food also implied giving respect to the cook, and we were at least polite to her until she left. Then Vimalananda said, as he stared at her vegetables, "Who does she think she is trying to fool? She makes a big show of her devo tional service, but we all know what is on her mind. She pretends that she is chaste, but you can see from her face that she is enjoying regular sex, proba bly with her 'friend' Mr. Ginwalla.” 

"With him?" I asked unbelieving. “She must be fifteen or twenty years younger than that old Parsi." 

"That is precisely my point. Do you think they are having an affair because she loves him truly? Forget it! She stays with him because he is so useful to her. She must have seduced him, probably after first feeding him to the gills, and now she has him dangling from her pubic hair. She thinks she can simi larly entice me into bed with her and then tow me around by my cock. She doesn't know that I have escaped from much worse traps than hers." 

He sighed. “I don't like to toot my own horn, but very few people with real spiritual credentials have ever been able to stay in Bombay for very long with out being ruined. Even the best of sadhus have been affected, if only in a small way. And sadhus who have not perfected themselves are lost once they come here, completely lost. This is why I call Bombay Mohamayi Nagari, “The City of Delusion. Did you know that the very ground on which Bombay is built is cursed?” 

“You mean that blessings and curses can affect land and water too??" 

“Yes, they can. In fact, tradition states that the entire Konkan, the whole southwest coastal strip of India, is cursed. Whole districts of Eastern India are cursed. The Tapti River, which flows through Surat in Gujarat, is cursed. 

“Specific villages are also sometimes hexed. Once I took some of my friends to such a village. During the day it was deserted, and seemed harmless enough. As night fell I drew a circle with a mantra around our group and warned them that I would not be responsible for what would happen to any one of them who dared to step out of the circle before daylight. That night the spirits of the people who had lived there when the village was cursed came to harass us. They harassed us all night long, shouting, 'Come one step outside and we will 

188 

The City of Delusion 

make you just like we are!' By morning my friends were thoroughly shaken, let me tell you. They forgot ever again to ask about the nature of spirits. 

"In Bombay's case the curse affects the minds of everyone who lives here. Part of the effect comes via Bombay's gravity, part from our drinking water, but quite a lot of it comes from our food. All the food that is grown and cooked in this area is affected by the curse. When people eat this food they partake of the effects of the curse and fall prey to delusion." 

"And this curse is separate from the faults of food that are due to the ava rice of the farmer, the middleman, or the merchant, the unthinking hurry of the cook, and the forgetfulness of the eater." . 

“Yes, and those faults just reinforce the curse.” 

“This curse presumably makes people like Miss Bhambani and Mamraba hen worse than they normally would be.” 

"Naturally." 

“It must disturb even the great Chotu," I said impishly, and Chotu bel lowed in mock offense. 

“Yes, even Chotu.” “Haven't you and your family also been affected by this curse?” 

“For fifteen generations we escaped it and thrived in Bombay, thanks to the blessing that was given to our ancestor Seth Sagal Shah, and the protection that our own personal deities provided us. Our family traded with China and dealt in silk and silver. We made money fairly by adding a fixed 10% of cost to the price of our goods as our profit. We were pretty well shielded from misery until my father's brother's mind was degraded by greed and our fortune dis appeared.” 

"How did that happen?" 

“Well, as the eldest of three brothers my father was the head of their joint family. All went well until he inherited a great deal of tainted money from his father's brother, who had earned it through his legal practice. Shortly there after one of my father's two brothers demanded the division of the loot. The case went all the way to the High Court, where millions of rupees were wasted in legal fees." 

“Amazing! The money that came in from legal fees contaminated even the good money you were making from your business. Is this a matter of the one bad apple can spoil a whole bushel' rule?” 

"That's right. Bad money can easily contaminate good money." 

"But still, if your family was protected how could your uncle's mind have become subverted?” 

"He fell under the influence of his wife Putlibai, who was the daughter of a bookkeeper, an accountantmand what will an accountant think of other 

189 

Aghora III: The Law of Karma 

than accounts? She pestered him to get a full accounting of his share for so long that he was eventually led astray, and estranged himself from his broth ers. She was doing this mainly for herself, of course, not for him. She had not grown up with money and had no idea of how to live with it. Why, when the car came for her on her wedding day to take her to the wedding she sat on its running board instead of inside it-she had never been in a car before! And what did she get for all her pains? She became notorious for being the de struction of the family fortune. How can I say notorious? Well, the High Court case was named after her and even now everyone who studies the law of joint families studies that case, the Putlibai case." 

“I still don't quite understand how your grandfather's mind became so dis turbed that he permitted the wedding to occur." 

"Nothing is permanent, not even a saint's blessings. Obviously our period as a prosperous family had ended, and we had to disappear from the scene. Nature needed a pretext to terminate our prosperity using Putlibai as Her in strument. 

“That does not amaze me. What does amaze me is that we could carry on in Bombay for as long as we did, for fifteen generations. Partly it was because we were householders. It is easier to try to neutralize this kind of curse when you are a householder. But when you are a sadhu the effects of such delusion are truly profound. If it is hard for you and me to avoid the negative influ ences of Bombay you can imagine how hard it must be for someone who has renounced the world in the pursuit of God. 

“I personally know the truth of this story: There was a good sadhu at Mount Abu who once cured a Marwari lady of tuberculosis by using nothing but ash from his fire. After a year of, 'Please, Maharaj, just this once, he fi nally agreed to come to Bombay for a brief stay with the lady's family. A good sadhu knows that he has to pay back his hospitality, in part to try to negate the effects of the food he eats. So this fellow told the lady's husband, a wealthy cotton merchant, to lock him in the toilet for twenty days. When he came out he told the merchant to buy all the cotton he could find in the market, and to sell it only when the sadhu directed him to do so. 

“Before long the merchant had cornered the market. The sadhu had him self locked in the toilet again, this time for a month -no food, no water, nothing. When he came out he told the merchant, 'Sell!' He sold, and made one hundred million rupees. Do you know how much money that is? This was almost fifty years ago, so it would be equivalent to more than a billion ru pees today (tens of millions of dollars). 

"When a Marwari makes money he becomes deliriously happy, and this merchant was no different. He started to feed the sadhu with rich food 

190The City of Delusion 

cooked in ghee (clarified butter), and all the finest sweets. Before long all this heavy food had an aphrodisiac effect on the poor sadhu. All alone for years in the jungle, eating nothing but roots and fruits, drinking only water, and never toying with any woman. The result? He got entangled in an affair with the merchant's wife. 

"When the merchant found out about the affair he was in a quandry. He couldn't insult the sadhu who had given him all that money, but he didn't want to go on being cuckolded either. He decided to be generous. So he hired a goldsmith's daughter and gave her to the sadhu to enjoy. Soon the sadhu was enjoying both her and the wife. He had been in the forest a long time, so he had plenty of appetite for sex. 

“This went on for so long that the merchant finally became exasperated. One day he told the sadhu, “You stop this nonsense now or I will call the police! 

"The sadhu lost his temper and said to him, 'Fool! Have you forgotten that I made you? My penance is finished now, true, but I have enough left for one last curse: Become a beggar!' Overnight the merchant became a beggar. Be fore long he died, still a beggar. The sadhu took the two ladies with him and supported himself and them for several years by making Ayurvedic medi cines. But he was completely ruined as a sadhu, all because he came to Bom bay in Kali Yuga. 

"So many sadhus have been ruined that way here in Bombay. Sadhus are easily fooled by devious people. This is partly due to action and reaction sadhu is trying to reach the heights, so there is always a tendency to plum met-but it is mainly because he has become unsophisticated. He has begun to act like a child, or a dunce, or a demon, and like an animal he can be easily ensnared by those who are still sophisticated, particularly when they start to feed him. 

“If you think about these things long enough you will eventually begin to wonder about eating.” 

"Wonder what?” 

"Wonder, 'Why should humans and animals have to eat at all, if eating is such a dangerous business? Why shouldn't they live like plants and get all their nutrition from the sun?' 

"Well," I offered,"other than the obvious scientific reason, which is that you cannot get enough energy from the sun fast enough to move around as much as animals move around, I don't know." 

“If we did not eat what would we do with the Law of Karma? Without karma and rnanubandhana how would the play go on? They are essential parts of the world. Do you have any idea of how thoroughly rnanubandhana permeates our lives? Look at this paint on the wall. Even it has a rnanu 

191 

Aghora III: The Law of Karma 

bandhana with me. When that rnanubandhana is finished it will flake off, or I will get the idea to repaint it. Even the stones that make up the floor have a connection. How can you explain it except via the Law of Karma? Or think of a fly who is born and then dies within a few seconds. What sort of karma did it do to force it to take birth for such a short period, or even to take birth at all? It is all perfect when you consider rnanubandhana. 

“And don't delude yourself to think that plants do not perform karmas. What do you think their roots are doing? While absorbing water they may be annihilating so many millions of bacteria. Every living being is subject to the Law of Karma, except the man who has learned to do without food alto gether, either from the upper mouth or from the lower mouth, the genitals. Such a being is a Vayu Ahari; he lives on air alone, and gets his prana directly from the atmosphere and the sun. Until then, though, you have to eat, and eating is as much a karma as is collecting food to eat." 

“So what is the answer?” A certain sense of resigned despair at the puis sance of the Law of Karma flitted through my mind. 

“To begin with, always try to eat with people who owe you food, karmi cally. To pay back a debt of money is very easy; such a rna is quickly dis pensed with. But how can you ever pay back a debt of food? Once that food had entered your circulation and been converted into the very tissues of your body how can you ever requite it? Repaying such a debt could bankrupt you." 

“Bankrupt your shakti, you mean.” 

“Yes. This is one of the reasons that a good sadhu will never take food from anyone on a regular basis if he can avoid it. This is also the reason I try to avoid eating other people's food.” 

“Except Motibahen's." 

“This is my point. If I have a rnanubandhana with her that will best be ful filled by eating her food then that's what I need to do. A sensible person who cannot avoid eating will take food only from those who have appropriate rnanubandhanas with him. That way he will not create new rnanubandhanas with people who might project their own delusions onto him. At least this way you can get used to one set of delusions and become immune to them. And besides, do I encourage Motibahen to bring her food over here?” 

"No." 

"Correct. I prefer to eat my own food, which I cook whenever I am in the mood to do so. Home-cooked food is always better for anyone, which is why Bombay has the dhabawalas." The dhabawalas are men who bring hot home cooked lunches to hundreds of thousands of workers in Bombay every day. "You can look at the dhabawalas if you want proof that it is not impossible to live in Bombay without scuttling yourself. It just requires some effort, and 

192 

The City of Delusion 

the dhabawalas are willing to make the effort. They have never gone on strike and have never been known to molest any of the ladies whom they collect lunches from. And why not? Because they are devotees of Vitthala; they spend all their spare time worshipping Him. When their minds are full of Vittala how can any base thought disturb them? 

“One reason I like to stay with Roshni is because I like to eat Roshni's food when I am not in the mood to cook. Roshni's food is tasty and does not dis turb my mind. Why? Because she is serious about her sadhana. She repeats her mantra while she cooks, which gives the food a beautiful spiritual vibra tion. Also, she feeds me out of love and not because she wants to extract something from me, as most people do. There have been so many like Miss Bambhani who have tried to ruin me over the years, but I have not yet scut tled myself. I was born in Bombay; I know the ropes." 

“But why then," I interrupted," do you continue to live in Bombay, when staying here means you have to cope with this curse and all these other prob lems?' 

"Ah, my boy, that is the Law of Karma,"Vimalananda replied sadly, his gaze drifting momentarily off into the distance. “I have my karmic debts to pay off. There are so many types of rna: debts to your parents, to your teachers, to the knowledge itself. One type of debt is to the place you were born in. Once I've paid off all these debts, goodbye! But until then I have to remain. When your foot is trapped underneath a stone you don't pull it out abruptly, if you want to preserve your skin. You lift the stone carefully, little by little, and little by little you remove your foot, ever so slowly until it is freed." 

"What about the people who come along and try to step on the stone while you are trying to remove your foot?” 

“Well, you have to be prepared for them. Years ago my Junior Guru Maharaj came to me and said, “You had better watch out, babuji—he always called me 'babuji---someone is trying to use black magic to kill you? I had not expected this. I knew I was in danger. In those days one of my aunts was trying to do away with me for my inheritance. She had tried to have me killed before, more than once, by various methods. But by using black magic she was upping the ante. 

“I told him, “Pah, Maharaj, don't worry about it even for a moment. He loves me so much that he was very concerned for my welfare. But he knows I can take care of myself when it comes to black magic. 

“I made some inquiries from an ethereal friend and found out that my aunt had hired Balam Bhat to do the work. I have always been blunt and out spoken, so I went myself to Balam Bhat and came to the point: ‘Balam Bhat, you have been our family priest for decades. You presided over my naming ceremony, the first cutting of my hair, my first meal of cooked food. How 

193 

Aghora III: The Law of Karma 

could you ever dream of lifting your hand against me, when you have looked upon me as your own son?' 

“At first he denied it, but when I persisted he flew into a rage and said things like, 'Who do you think you are? I will finish you off!' 

“Then I said, 'All right, go ahead and try, and went to the smashan. I told my friend, 'You were right, it is Balam Bhat who is trying to do me in. What shall I do?' 

“My friend told me, 'Don't worry about a thing; let me handle it. 

“And how he handled it! Next morning there were twenty-three corpses to be disposed of: Balam Bhat and twenty-two of his relatives." 

“My goodness!” 

"Yes, it is unfortunate that it had to end that way, but Balam Bhat had asked for it. Besides, his death prevented him from incurring the karma of killing me." 

“Didn't you have a mountain of karmas to deal with, though, from initiat ing the whole process?” 

"Naturally. Even though I never explicitly told my ethereal friend to do in Balam Bhat and his whole family I did authorize him to handle the job, which makes me responsible for what happened. But I escaped from those karmas too. In fact, I offered all the victims as Nara Balis! Thank God for my mentors; they taught me how to deal with such things." 

“So you were saved again, as usual." 

"Why not? If you take life here as a challenge you'll decide to succeed at it or die trying. Why be frightened? But since Bombay is such a dangerous place, in so many ways, you have to be sure to always use stratagem (kala) in stead of force (bala) to pay off your rnas, if you don't want to be sunk.” 

“This is why you are fond of Birbal." 

"Yes, that is why. He was a master of stratagem." Out came a sudden chuckle that started a story: “You know, many of Akbar's courtiers hated Bir bal passionately because he was so close to the emperor. They schemed day and night over ways to do away with him. No matter how hard they tried to catch him off guard he would almost always outsmart them. For example, when one of them told Akbar that Birbal claimed to be able to read minds Akbar asked Birbal to demonstrate this power. Birbal replied, 'Your Majesty's mind is much too subtle for someone like me to read. But I do know what ev eryone else is thinking. They are thinking, “May God bless our Emperor to rule over us in power and prosperity for many years, and may his fame spread far and wide." Isn't that so, O members of the court??" 

"I suppose all the courtiers then had to agree that Birbal could read minds." "Could they do anything but agree?" 

194 

The City of Delusion 

Three laughs merged above the remains of our food. We moved into the sitting room, and as he sipped his tea Vimalananda continued: “Another time they thought they had a foolproof plan. It required an accomplice, so they re cruited the royal barber with the help of a huge sum of money. A few days later while he was shaving the sovereign the barber slyly said, 'You are enjoy ing yourself in such luxury here, my liege. Don't you ever wonder how your father must be passing his days in heaven?' 

“What a fool you are!' said the emperor. 'How do you think I would be able to enquire about my father's status in heaven?' 

“I know a magician, Great One, who can send anyone to heaven while still alive to check up on our dead ancestors 

"Akbar stroked his mustache thoughtfully, then said to the barber, Make the necessary arrangements, and send someone immediately to bring news of my father. 

“ 'I will do so immediately, master,' said the barber. “But we must send an important and experienced person on this errand, someone who will know just how to act in heaven, and how to find your father. 

“'Hmm,' said Akbar. “Who do you have in mind?' “Why, Prince Birbal, o Refuge of the World, replied the wily barber. “Birbal!' boomed the king, "Why Birbal?' 

“No one in the world is as clever or wise as is Birbal, Your Majesty, offered the barber obsequiously.” Who else will be a fit ambassador from your court to the court of heaven? 

“Hmm,' said Akbar. All right, we will send Birbal. But just exactly how do you plan to do this?"" 

“'What we will do, your worship,' said the barber hastily, sensing success, ‘is to put Birbal into a special house built in the smashan. Then we will set the house on fire. Because of the powerful mantras this great sage will recite, the fire will not kill Birbal. Instead, it will take him straight to heaven, alive and unhurt. I have been there myself on a visit, more than once.” 

"It sounds like the barber was embellishing the script." 

“He was probably salivating over the bonus he had been promised if this scheme actually worked." 

"Did Akbar believe any of this?" "No, he knew what sort of man his barber was." 

“Wasn't he concerned, though, that Birbal might not be able to escape and would be burned alive?” 

“He probably was concerned, but he also knew that Birbal could take care of himself. Besides, he wanted to teach all his jealous ministers a good lesson, and he enjoyed keeping Birbal on his toes. 

195 

Aghora III: The Law of Karma 

"Birbal arrived at court the next day to find a rude surprise awaiting him, for Akbar ordered him to get ready to go to heaven straightaway. When he heard the details of his mission, Birbal immediately recognized the nature of the trap and knew who had set it. He thought for a moment and then said, 'Your maj esty, when I am ready to go to hell for you going to heaven will be a pleasure. But if I am to go I will need quite a lot of money to make my preparations. 

“You may have as much money as you need, the Emperor assured him. “Also, I will need time to make arrangements with my family before my departure,' said Birbal. 

“How long will you need? asked Akbar. “ Three months, replied Birbal, and this period was granted to him. 

"Now Birbal had some breathing time. He gave the money to his wife as insurance, just in case he should fail to escape. Then he set out to save him self. He began by planning out a tunnel from his house to the smashan. All night long he would dig to extend the tunnel, and each day he would work in the smashan preparing the hut he would need for his voyage. 

"Birbal finished the hut and the tunnel just a few days before the end of his three-month grace period, and on the appointed day he called on the em peror and declared that he was ready to go. He was then taken in a gala pro cession to the site and entered the hut, which was just atop the tunnel. The pyre was then lit, and the fake saint began to chant ostentatiously. Birbal had cleverly selected the greenest wood that he could find, so it did not take long for a mammoth cloud of smoke to accumulate. Under the cover of this smoke he crept off through the tunnel to his own house, taking care to fill in the mouth of the tunnel as he went. He waited there silently in hiding for three months, without cutting his hair or beard. In fact, he was gone so long that Akbar was worried that he actually was gone for good.” 

"Well, Akbar had put him in mortal danger, so it served him right, didn't it?" 

"Yes, I'm sure Birbal deliberately prolonged his stay in hiding, just to rub some salt in the wound. When Birbal did return to the court after those three months he made a sudden, dramatic appearance there. Akbar embraced him in ecstasies and said, 'How are you, my dear friend? How was your trip, and how is heaven? 

" It was a long, dangerous trip, your majesty, but somehow I managed it and made it back here to give you a report. 

“Don't keep me in suspense, Birbal, tell me how my saintly father is doing! said Akbar loudly, playing to the gallery. 

"Oh, he is very well, my lord. All is fine in heaven.' And Birbal went on and on, describing the glories of the angels and the luxuries of the blessed. Then he concluded with, ‘But there is one thing... 

196 

The City of Delusion 

“What is it?' said the emperor anxiously, while all the courtiers showed their great concern. 

“Well,' said Birbal, “Your father gets everything he wants-good food, ele gant clothes, beautiful women, all the comforts. He is sad only about one lit tle thing? 

“What is it?' asked Akbar impatiently. 

« 'He told me not to bother anyone about it; said Birbal, stretching out the suspense. 

“But now that we have found a way to reach heaven, said the Emperor, 'we can send anything to him from here, and all the courtiers nodded in agreement. 

“ Wellliill, said Birbal,'your papa said that he gets everything he asks for in paradise-except for a good shave. 

"What, asked Akbar amazedly,'has no dead barber yet reached heaven?' “No, sire,' said Birbal,'none so far.” I had to interrupt:“What an insult to barbers!" 

"Well, Birbal really wanted to make the barber twist in the wind. He said, ‘Look at my appearance, lord. Wouldn't I have shown myself to you clean shaven if I could have located a barber? I even had trouble recognizing your father, his hair and beard were so long. He sends you his blessings, and he did request you--if it was no trouble.... 

“What request? Tell me immediately! Akbar thundered. “ Your father asked you to send him a good barber, if you can spare one.? 

“But of course,' said the emperor grandly. “In fact, let us send this noble barber of ours! It is he who showed us how to reach heaven, where he has vis ited more than once, and he deserves to return there now. And that was the end of the barber.” 

"Did Akbar really have him burnt alive?” 

"It's hard to say. Some versions of this story say that the barber was burned. Others say that he avoided becoming a nice roast by confessing everything, that he then spent most of the rest of his life in the dungeon for attempting to murder Birbal. Whichever was his fate it served him right, which proves my point. If Birbal had tried to use force to save himself his enemies might have been able to gang up on him and kill him. He used deception instead and was saved. I myself use deception freely so that, God willing, those whom I love and who love me will continue to be saved." 

"Even the ones who fight with you?" I tossed in provocatively. “Yes, even people like Roshni and her family." 

Roshni, who had meanwhile arrived home from work and was knitting peacefully in her chair, glowered at him lovingly over the tops of her glasses. 

197 

Aghora III: The Law of Karma 

“Doesn't deception imply karma?” 

“Karma is everywhere. But if you deceive people without literally lying to them, like Yuddhisthira didnaro va kunjaro va-then the karma is much reduced." 

Asvatthama, the son of Guru Dronacharya, shared his name with an ele phant. When during the great war that the Mahabharata chronicles it looked as if Dronacharya had become unconquerable Krishna directed that the ele phant Asvatthama be killed and that a rumor be spread that it was Asvat thama the man who had died. After hearing this rumor a worried Dronacharya came to Yuddhisthira, whose name was a byword for truthful ness, to ask if his son were dead. Though the two of them were fighting on opposing sides Dronacharya, who was Yuddhisthira's weapons guru, knew that Yuddhisthira would not lie to him. Indeed, Yuddhisthira loudly replied to Dronacharya, “Asvatthama is dead!” Then, following Krishna's instruc tions, he added in a whisper, “Naro va kunjaro va (“either the man or the ele phant”). Dronacharya, who could hear only the first phrase, wrongly concluded that his son was dead. This knocked all the fight out of him and he was himself killed shortly thereafter, which benefitted the cause of Krishna and Yuddhisthira. But even though they represented the letter of the truth Yuddhisthira's words had the impact of a lie. Due to that deception Yud dhisthira had to start walking on the ground again, instead of walking a foot above it as his unwavering adherence to truth had previously permitted him to do. If that was the effect of “much reduced” karma I hated to think what might have happened to Yuddhisthira had he performed overt guru droha by openly lying to his guru. 

"What I really don't understand about this story," I said to Vimalananda, “is why the karma for lying didn't cling to Krishna instead of to Yuddhisthira when it was Krishna Who forced Yuddhisthira to violate his personal dharma by speaking what amounted to a lie." 

"It is very simple," replied Vimalananda. “Krishna didn't identify with His advice to Yuddhisthira and Yuddhisthira self-identified with his deception to his guru. Krishna was Yogeshvara, the Lord of Yoga. Karma rolled off Him just like water rolls off a duck's back. He would create a situation, watch it be ing played out, and still remain a karmically-aloof observer. Wah, Krishna, wah! No one can know every aspect of Your play!” 

Vimalananda glanced momentarily at Roshni and Chotu before continu ing: “Anytime you act with self-identification, my boy, a karma is created no matter how noble your motives. And rnanubandhanas can multiply rapidly when your karma involves putting your neck out to try to save someone. This is something I know only too well. My dear old friend Faram, Roshni's late 

198 

The City of Delusion 

father, really loved me and used to look after me; I in turn had looked after him. I even postponed his death more than once. You can ask Chotu about it if you like.” Chotu nodded gravely. 

"Unfortunately, towards the end of Faram's life something happened to his mind—it was Mahakala, Death Personified, inciting him—which made him become very argumentative with me. Not only that, but he cheated me more than once. I warned him several times that he was playing with a live wire, but he persisted. He had always been obstinate. 

"After a lot of this there came a time when I had to go to Delhi. I warned him not to eat fish, beef, or pork while I was out of Bombay. You see, he was a Parsi, and they eat everything. I also exhorted him not to curse me in any way, because I knew this would be the excuse Mahakala would use to take him away. And I told him, 'I know you're not going to listen to me, and that you are going to eat meat and abuse me. Don't worry, though; even after you die I'll look after your children.' I promised his wife and children that as soon as he died I would come immediately no matter where I was, and I made them promise not to remove the body until I got back. Then I left. 

"After finishing my work in Delhi I went down to a certain sacred moun tain in South India. No females are permitted there, and no men dare ascend it except on one day during the year—Maha Shivaratri. On that day they go up the mountain early in the morning, worship at the Shiva temple, and come right back down. It is not a mountain for the curious or the insincere." 

When I first visited this mountain, a month after Vimalananda's demise, I discovered that on one Maha Shivaratri not too long before two hundred men had lost their way in the fog and died of exposure. It was apparently a 

hell of a job to get all the corpses down off the hill. 

“There are dense elephant jungles on this mountain, filled with plenty of dangerous wild animals. There is also a huge bull elephant; he and I are the best of friends. Whenever I would go there he would sit near my fire and play with my hair using his trunk. He is not really an elephant, of course; he is something else entirely. 

"There I was on the mountain sitting at my fire, keeping track of all my loved ones ‘long distance with its help, when suddenly I saw the dead body of my friend Faram. Then I saw that he had eaten fish and had called me all the foul names in the book ending with, 'I never want to see his blessed face again. As soon as he spoke those words he keeled over and died. When I saw that I knew he was dead." 

“You didn't wonder if the vision was true?” 

“The fire never lies. Ethereal beings may stretch the truth on occasion, but the fire will never be false to you. I was sure he was dead and was plunged into 

199 

Aghora III: The Law of Karma 

despair. How would I ever get back to Bombay in time for the funeral and fulfill my promise to his children? The promise was the action. Now I was ex periencing the reaction. I have always believed that promises are meant to be kept, but here I was on a mountaintop far from civilization. I would have to hike down to the road, catch a bus to the nearest town, and then find a train or plane. All that would take at least a couple of days. I had to be in Bombay in a matter of minutes. It looked impossible. 

“While I was worrying over this my elephant came up to me, nuzzled me with his trunk, and asked, 'What's wrong?' I explained everything, and he told me, “I'll see that you get back to Bombay immediately. But first you must promise me that you won't bring this fellow back to life. He knew my habits. There was no other way, so I promised him. Another promise, another karma. 

Close your eyes,' he told me. When I opened them I was on the landing in front of my friend's flat in Bombay. The door was open. 

"I was a little shaken to think that I was back in Bombay, but there was no time to lose. I rushed into the flat. Roshni met me and with tears in her eyes told me that her father's body had just been taken away just minutes before. I rushed to the Tower of Silence in pouring rain. Ask Roshni; she'll tell you." Roshni nodded her assent. 

"The Parsis believe that the fire is polluted if it touches a corpse. They nei ther bury nor burn their dead. Instead they expose them in a place called the Tower of Silence for the vultures, crows, rats and other scavangers to polish off. They perform plenty of rituals before the body is taken into the tower— otherwise how could the priests make a living?---but once the bodies are laid out on the marble slab inside they get eaten all the same. 

“According to their traditions no non-Parsi is supposed to even look at the body of a dead Parsi after it has been washed. I have never cared for such big oted traditions, so I went in straight away. I think I am still the only non Parsi ever to enter a Tower of Silence. All the mourners were shocked, but no one could prevent me. I went up to my friend, kissed him, and said, 'Well, old boy, I couldn't save you this time. But don't worry, I'll look after your kids. The priests sat there aghast, but all they could do was to cough sugges tively while they fanned themselves, as if their fire was troubling them greatly. I ignored them; how can you take a priest seriously if he is afraid of his own god?" 

Roshni, Vimalananda and I would drive past the Tower of Silence from time to time, mainly on those occasions when we went to eat at Tehmul's res idence up on the top of Malabar Hill. The building in which Tehmul stayed used to be part of the garden of the bungalow in which Vimalananda was raised. Half-a-dozen high-rises have since sprouted in place of the bungalow, 

200The City of Delusion 

and the hyper-rich now pay $10,000 a month or more per flat for the privi lege of calling Malabar Hill home. 

“Was it your promise to Faram that has made you a part of Roshni's kar mic family?" I queried, glancing over to see if this would get a rise out of Roshni. 

"No," Vimalananda scowled with a grin, “I already had a complicated rnanubandhana with Faram which brought me into contact with Roshni and her other family members long back. But this promise did cause me to have to begin to stay with this family in order to save it. And that has led me into a whole new series of rnanubandhanas, with Parsis in particular. 

"The original home of the Parsis was ancient Persia, which some of us call Vasistha Bhumi (“the land of the Rishi Vasistha'). Ages back Vasistha Rishi went there and taught the Persians how to worship the fire. For centuries they practiced their religion sincerely. Then almost 1400 years ago Caliph Omar led the Muslim invasion of Persia, and who abetted his conquest? The Zoroastrian priests! They betrayed the secrets of the country's defence to him. The Zoroastrian religion has some good techniques for obtaining sid dhis, and had these priests could have supported their own king by using their occult powers. If they had Omar might never have been able to conquer their country. But the priests were tempted by money, and invited Omar in. And what was the first thing he did after conquering Persia? He executed all the Zoroastrian priests that he could catch! He was an orthodox Muslim, and like many orthodox Muslims he sincerely believed that all other religions are false and should be eliminated. The few Parsi priests who survived fled to a ship and sailed here to India. What other country would take them? Our doors are open for everyone: the Parsis, the Jews, everyone. India is a big gar bage dump for all the religions that have no place left to go." 

"So the Parsis landed here and started to thrive again." 

“When they reached India they landed at Sanjan in Gujarat. On hearing of their arrival Jadavji Rana, the king of that region, sent them a bowl filled to the brim with milk. That was his message to them. The message read: 'My kingdom is already full of people, and there is no space for any more.” 

“Now what to do? Fortunately one of the Parsis, Dastur Meherjee Rana, had a brilliant idea. He took some powdered sugar and added it very carefully to the milk, so that no drops spilled out. Then he gingerly laid some rose pet als onto its surface. This was his reply to the king: 'Your majesty, we are so few that we will blend in among your people as easily and invisibly as this sugar dissolves in this milk, and like the sugar our presence will“sweeten" your do main. Like the rose petals we will provide you beauty and fragrance without being any burden, When Jadavji Rana ‘read this message he said to his advi 

201 

Aghora III: The Law of Karma 

sors, “This is a man of subtle intelligence! This is the kind of man that we need in our kingdom. Let them remain!' And ever since then the Parsis have done well for themselves here in India, because of stratagem, not strength.” 

"You seem to really like the Parsis in spite of all your ranting about them and their priests.” 

“Does he have any choice?" an aroused Roshni asked sharply. “He is part of our family now, he has become one of us!” 

“Quiet, you!" growled Vimalananda affectionately. “I may be one of you, but I will never become a Parsi, even if I could. And I can't, thank God, for even though the Parsis are a miniscule minority they still refuse to permit conversions. At least they have not abandoned their fire worship. But very few of today's Zoroastrians have any real affection for their god the fire. Most of their priests have forgotten the true meaning of their religion, and all they have left are empty rituals. But they do know how to extract money from the people. Suppose some part of your body is removed in an operation. Whether it is a wart, a finger, or your penis, an orthodox Parsi must spend thousands of rupees for special ceremonies for it. And what is the holiest sub stance to Parsis? Bull's urine, processed in a certain way, which is also fabu lously expensive. Was any of this Zoroaster's idea? No, it was all an invention of the priests. The priestly classes in every religion are always scoundrels.” 

“If Zarathustra's religon has been despoiled by its priests hasn't Hinduism also been distorted by some of its priests?" 

"Our Vedic religion has been absolutely ruined by its priests, the Brah manas. Could the Muslims have ever sacked Somnath (a famous Shiva tem ple in the Western Indian state of Gujarat) if the priests there had not been corrupt? No. Even now most priests do all sorts of rituals without having any idea of what it is they are doing or why they are doing it. But they still collect hefty fees for what they do, just because they are Brahmanas. It was the law giver Manu, who came along much later than the Vedas, who invented all this business of Brahmana supremacy. You don't find it in the original Vedic tra dition. Back in Vedic times the Rishi Vishvamitra even decided that there was no need for any restrictions about the intermarriage of castes after he mar ried a dasyu (a member of an outcaste group). Vasistha Rishi opposed him in the beginning but eventually had to go along." 

"Why?" 

“Vishvamitra was born a Kshatriya, and had been a king before he became a Rishi. His motto was, Succeed, or die trying!' Vasistha was a Brahmana, and Brahmanas always believe in going with the times, because they are beg gars. If they don't give allegiance to the king how will they be fed? It was the same principle that led the Zoroastrian priests to try to strike terms with 

202 

The City of Delusion 

Omar. Even now the Parsis will support whoever is in power-first Jadavji Rana, then the British, and now the Indian government. They are opportun ists, just like our Brahmanas. Vasistha, who was a Rishi, cared nothing for money, fame, or any other such worldly prize; but he did understand that discretion is the better part of valor. He followed Vishvamitra's lead and eventually he even became the guru of a group of dasyus: the Zoroastrians!” 

"You don't have much value for Brahmanas, do you? Haven't they done any good at all?” 

“I draw a distinction between the real Brahmana and the Brahmana by birth. Listen to this Sanskrit shloka (verse): ‘By birth everyone is a shudra (“one who performs laborious work”), by samskaras you become a dvija (a "twice-born”), by learning you become a vipra ("one who shakes with ec stasy”), and by knowing the Absolute Reality of the Brahman you become a brahmana. I bow down again and again to those true Brahmanas, the know ers of the Absolute. It is they who have made India a spiritual powerhouse." 

"But you don't seem to care much for Adi (the original) Shankaracharya." 

"Although the original Shankaracharya was a famous philosopher and evan gelist of Vedanta, he was still only a jnani (a knower of Reality). He was not a vijnani, a Siddha. Although he was a great man he did commit some blunders." 

“Everyone makes mistakes." 

“Yes, but everyone does not set out to change the world. At first Shankara charya was afraid of Ma. He preached that Shakti was to be rejected and only Shaktiman, the Controller of Shakti, the Ultimate Absolute, was to be wor shipped. He somehow forgot that it is utterly impossible for Shaktiman to exist without Shakti. Ma had to teach him some hard lessons, in Kashmir and Mith 

ila-remember the Mandan Mishra episode?-before he could realize this." 

"What happened in Kashmir?” When Shankaracharya went to Mithila to challenge the knowledgeable Mandan Mishra to a debate he was on the point of winning when Mandan Mishra's wife insisted that Shankaracharya debate her as well. She began to speak on sex, a subject about which the celibate since-birth Shankaracharya knew nothing; he had to plead for a recess to learn about it. Leaving his physical body in a cave he used his astral body to reanimate the physical body of a recently deceased king. He then used that body to learn all about sex with the willing help of the women in that king's harem, who thought their liege had risen from the dead. After he had col lected enough knowledge Shankaracharya departed the old king's body, rein habited his own, and returned to Mithila to complete Mandan Mishra's defeat. But Mandan Mishra's wife got the last laugh when she reminded Shankaracharya that he had taken a vow of celibacy. Becaue he taught that only consciousness is real it was his consciousness that had taken that vow. 

203 

Aghora III: The Law of Karma 

But in order to win the debate he had enjoyed sex with his consciousness, al beit in another body. Thus he had broken his vow. 

"Well, Shankaracharya was touring around in Kashmir, preaching his doc trine of non-duality and saying all sorts of wrong things about shakti. Now, Kashmir is a stronghold of Tantra, one of Ma's chief haunts. The very word Kashmir is a corruption of the Sanskrit Kshira Bhavani (Ma's Milk'), which is the snow that falls there. Shankaracharya was playing with fire when he went there to insult Ma. 

"One morning as he was about to begin his talks an old woman came up to him and said, “My son, quit this slander of Shakti; were you not born from a woman?"When he started to preach to her she disappeared. 

"At noon the same thing happened, but with a middle-aged woman; he ig nored her too. In the evening, a young girl came to him—notice how She has been getting younger with each appearance—and told him, 'Great Sage, if you don't stop defaming Shakti you are headed for big trouble.' Still he ig nored her—until he developed a sudden, intense case of diarrhea which lasted until he woke up out of his stupor. What was Ma to do? She had tried to persuade him to change, but when he refused she realized that he was set in his ways and that only a good karmic purge would do. After taking all this strong medicine that Ma had to dish out to him Shankaracharya finally learned his lesson. Now the Shri Chakra, the greatest yantra of Shakti, is wor shipped in all his monasteries. 

“But God wasn't finished with Shankaracharya yet! Next Lord Shiva took His turn with him. Shankaracharya was bathing one day in the city of Ba naras, which is Shiva's home, when Shiva took the form of a chandala ('dog eater'; the lowest of the low) and splashed some water on Shankaracharya. No Brahmana likes to be touched by an outcaste or by anything that has touched an outcaste, and Shankaracharya said testily, 'Oh chandala! Take care of where you splash! 

“The chandala said, “Maharaj, of what should I take care? You teach that the world and everything in it, including our physical bodies, are unreal. The touch of that water on your flesh must therefore be equally unreal? 

"Shankaracharya was momentarily taken aback by this answer, but then he recovered and said, 'I was speaking not of your body but of your samskaras. 

"To this the chandala replied, 'If my samskaras reside in my body how can they be any more real than it is? And besides, are we not bathing in the Ganga (the River Ganges), whose waters remove all sin? If this is true its waters must negate my evil samskaras as soon as they touch me? 

"All of a sudden Shankaracharya realized with whom he was talking, and fell at the chandala's feet. Shiva had taught him yet another good lesson. 

204 

The City of Delusion 

Shankaracharya was still discriminating on the basis of purity and impurity, and Lord Shiva showed him that the real purity is internal." 

“Which I suppose is one reason why Lord Shiva drinks poison." 

"Yes. Lord Shiva drinks poison, but never lets it fall lower than his throat. That way He is always in perfect control of the poison's effects. Lord Shiva is called Nilakantha (“Blue-Throat') because all the poison He has consumed has turned His throat blue. Do you know the name of the poison He drank on the occasion of the churning of the Ocean of Milk?” 

"Halahala." "Which is a word composed of two other words: hala and ahala." "Which basically mean'shaking and ‘nonshaking.' 

“Right. Mahakala kills you by shaking you-shaking your Kundalini's self identification with your body and mind. If you could remain unshaken un der all circumstances you would never need to die. Aghoris take intoxicants to teach themselves how to remain unshaken. If you hallucinate or lose con trol in any other way when you take an intoxicant know that the intoxicant has shaken' you. Halna nahi ('never get shook') should become your mantra. 

“The best way to to avoid being 'shook’ is to follow the path of bhakti. Shankaracharya was a jnani. He knew how to do a few things, which is nice, but he forgot that God knows how to do all things. Isn't it better to surrender to God and let God take care of everything? When Mirabai was given poison by her husband she first offered it to her beloved Krishna, Who transmuted that poison into nectar. That is the way to live your life, the way that Baba Chandal Das lived his." 

“Baba Chandal Das?! The Servant of the Dog-Eater Baba?” 

“Yes, Baba Chandal Das was the great devotee of Lord Shiva in His chan dala form. Can anything be low to a dog-eater? When this saint would arrive somewhere he would shout to the Lord, 'Baba Chandal Das! My bhakti, Your shakti—Your inspiration, my words—that's how my work gets done! Baba Chandal Das!' 

“Baba Chandal Das was the real thing. But Shankaracharya was not Baba Chandal Das and only learned a little from what Lord Shiva as chandala could have taught him. Shankaracharya's fundamental error was to spend his life moving about in India defeating people in debate." 

"How so?” "He taught Brahmam sat, jagan mithya—the Absolute is true, the Relative is false. But if the Relative is false and you are debating in the Relative you are just raising falsehoods to defeat falsehoods. What is the use in that? More over, if as he taught there is only one Reality of which everyone is a part then who is debating whom? Can the One debate with the One?" 

205 

Aghora III: The Law of Karma 

"Uh, well, no. But at least Shankaracharya wrote a number of beautiful hymns, like the Saundarya Lahari and the Bhaja Govindam." 

“Yes, he wrote beautifully, and I appreciate his work. But was he fully aware of the implications of what he wrote? Take just one example: he wrote, ‘Bad sons are sometimes born, but there is no such thing as a bad mother.' Esoter ically, this is quite true. Reverse atma (soul) and you get mata (mother). The Atma or Soul never leaves the body as long as it is alive; in fact, the body only lives because the Atma is within. This makes the Atma a good mother. Her son is the body, which is always a bad son because it is always getting em broiled in the samsara. But no matter what evil thing the body does its mother the Soul never forsakes Her child. Only a physical mother can be a bad mother. A woman who has not realized the Ma within her is a bad mother. So in the mundane sense Shankaracharya was wrong in saying there is no such thing as a bad mother. In Kali Yuga there are bad mothers every where, though bad sons are still more common than bad mothers.” 

"I'm not sure that I see your point here.” 

"My point is this: The writer of that verse was himself a terrible son. Shan karacharya was still a young boy when he wanted to run away from home and take the vows of sannyasa, renunciation of the world. His mother natu rally refused him permission to go out and ramble about the world. Any real mother will feel protective of her child, and Shankaracharya's mother was a good mother. 

"But Shankaracharya was determined to leave, and decided on a different course of action. He had been sent into the world for the specific purpose of establishing the orders of sannyasa, and he had been born with certain sid dhis to assist him in this work. One day when he and his mother were down on the banks of the river he used his siddhis to trick her. He created an illu sory crocodile which gripped his leg firmly and began to drag him into the river. You know the ferocity of crocodiles. 

"Shankaracharya called out to his mother in mock fright as the fake croc tugged him down, 'Ma! Ma! Save me! Give me permission to take sannyasa and then I can be freed! Otherwise I am doomed! Can you imagine the in tensity of the terror that attacked his mother in that moment? It was like a knife being pushed into her chest and slowly rotated in her heart.

Let this be a lesson to you: Unless you are very, very cautious the use of siddhis may have consequences that can persist for centuries or even millennia.” 

Dusk was falling as Harshbhai appeared at the door to end our afternoon of private audience. As I listened to this “spiritual child” describe to Vima lananda his marriage plans for his daughters I reflected on the siddhi warn ing. Here was Vimalananda, judiciously employing his many siddhis to keep slowly, slowly disentangling himself from his rnanubandhanas with people like Harshbhai. Trying simultaneously to keep from losing his skin and to avoid generating any new karmas as he dispensed with his expiring ones, Vi malananda lived with an elan and a joie de vivre that could only arise from his moment-by-moment recollection of the imminence of death.
