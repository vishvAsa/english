title = "02 The Nine Nath Siddhas"

+++

a 

The tradition of the Nine Nath Siddhas stems from the flowering of Shai vite Tantra around the tenth century. The word Nath is derived from the name of Shiva and its literal meaning is "Lord." The Naths brought to light various systems of tantric practices aimed at the transubrantation of the human body into a divine immortal body. Central to their methods were the practices of Hatha, Kundalini and Alchemical yogas. The North Indian tradi tion lists nine Naths and eighty-four Siddhas in its lineage, the most promi nent of which were Matsyendranath and Gorakhnath. Many of these eighty four Siddhas appear in the Buddhist tantric tradition, where it is sometimes said that they practiced Hindu tantra by day and Buddhist tantra at night. The various lists of the Nine Naths include: Matsyendranath, Gorakhnath, Jalandhara, Kanipa, Gopichand, Caurangi, Charpati, Dharamnath and Gaininath.

AGHORA II: Kundalini 

The Nath Siddha Matsyendranath 

Matsyendranath-the "Fish Lord,” is the first Guru of the nine Naths. Along with Gorakhnath he is regarded as the founder of the Nath, Kaula and Kanphata traditions, and with instigating the practices of Hatha, Laya and Raja yogas. According to legend he was a fisherman from Kamarupa in Assam who hooked a giant fish and was swallowed alive by it, like Jonah. The fish came to rest on the ocean floor near a hidden palace in which Shiva had chosen to transmit his most secret teaching to his consort Uma. From within the belly of the fish Matsyendranath overheard these secret teachings and received his mantra directly from Shiva, who had no option but to make Matsyendranath his disciple. Matsyendranath spent twelve years perfecting his sadhana in the belly of the fish until he was eventually disgorged onto dry land. He had many disciples, the most prominent of which was Gorakh nath. 

In Nepal, Matsyendranath is identified with the Buddhist bodhisattva of compassion, Avalokitesvara, who is himself identified with Shiva as Lokanath—“Lord of the World.” Matsyendranath is the patron deity of Nepal, and is believed to have brought the first grains of rice to this Hima layan Kingdom

AGHORA II: Kundalini 

The Nath Siddha Gorakhnath 

The Indian subcontinent is rich with stories and miraculous anecdotes about the life of Gorakhnath. He was probably born in the Punjab around the tenth century, although legend often dates him to a far more remote past. He travelled extensively across India, from Sindh to Bengal and from Nepal to Sri Lanka. In Nepal he is said to have caused a twelve year drought by the power of his meditation, which was only ended by the intercession of Matsyendranath. The city of Gorka in Nepal is named after Gorakhnath and its decendants now form the tribe of the Gurkas. He is believed by his fol lowers to be immortal and living to this day in the Himalayas; but at the vast temple complex in Gorakhpur in Uttar Pradesh is a tomb said to contain his body absorbed in Samadhi. His Hindu name Goraksha probably derived from “Protector of the Cows (Go)," or from a legend in which a barren woman, wishing to bear a son, received some ashes from Shiva's fire. Instead of swallowing the ashes she threw them on a pile of dung (ghor), and twelve years later Matsyendranath recovered a boy from this dung pile whom Shiva named after Gorakhnath—“The Lord of Dung.” 

Gorakhnath is said to have inspired such great luminaries as Kabir, Gopi chand, Guga, Puran Bhagat and Guru Nanak-the founder of the Sikh reli gion; in one record he is even reputed to have been the foster father and teacher of the Prophet Muhammed. His followers, known as Gorakhnaths, Naths and Kanphatas form the largest Indian tantric tradition. The Kanphatas are named after the practice of splitting the center of the ear to accomodate large ear-rings, usually made from rhinoceros horn, ivory, conch, copper or gold. Great importance is attached to these ear-rings; if they are pulled out or the ear mutilated the Kanphata yogin becomes an outcaste. In certain parts of India such an occurance would result in the yogin being buried alive with no tomb erected over his body.

The Nath Siddha Caurangi 

Cauranginath was a disciple and contemporary of Gorakhnath. Legend relates that he was the son of King Devapala of Bengal. Devapala's first wife died while Caurangi was still a child, and his father took a new wife who resorted to deception in order to place her own son on the throne. Caurangi was taken to a forest clearing where his arms and legs were cut off. Here he was found by Matsyendranath who instructed Gorakhnath to care for the limbless youth. Gorakhnath taught him the yoga of pot-like breath retention (kumbhaka), and after twelve years of this practice his limbs were miracu lously restored by the power of his own realization. 

His name Caurangi probably derives from “Four Limbs (anga)," and the shape of his torso as a bulb (kanda) possibly refers to his practice of Kanda Manda yoga. Caurangi is said to have founded the great Kali temple of Kalighat in Calcutta. The main north-south thoroughfare across the city of Calcutta is now known as Chowringhi.

AGHORA II: Kundalini 

The Nath Siddha Jalandhara 

Jalandhara, whose name means “Bearer of the Net," is also known in Ben gal as Hadipa—“born from a bone (hada) of Shiva." He is named after one of the four most sacred sites (pithas) of tantric practice, Jalandhara, located in the Kangra valley of northwest India and close to the modern city of Jul lunder. 

In the Nath legends, Hadipa was a sweeper of Bengal who became guru to the young king Gopichand. Gopichand doubted his guru's integrity and caused Hadipa to be buried alive in a pit. After twelve years, Hadipa's disci ple Kanipa was informed of this occurance by Gorakhnath, and Kanipa trav-- elled to Bengal to release his teacher. When Hadipa emerged alive from his ordeal, Gopichand repented of his actions and abdicated his throne to fol low the Nath path of his teacher Hadipa. 

Jalandhara was a great exponent of Hatha and Kundalini yogas. Gorakh nath comments that the term Hatha meaning “forceful” is made up of the two syllables ha and tha representing the solar and lunar channels which are forced into union (yoga) in the central channel of Sushumna.

AGHORA II: Kundalini 

The Nath Siddha Kanipa 

Kanipa was said to have been bom as a Brahmin in the Kingdom of Gaura near Bengal. His father is reputed to have been the fisherman who caught the fish from which Matsyendranath appeared. Kanipa's guru was Jalandhara and his legends are rich in anecdotes of the Bamarg or Left Hand Path. He was instrumental in the rise of the Kapalika and Carya traditions, composing a famous cycle of Bengali Carya songs known as the Caryagiti. He is also held to be one of the founders of the Aghori sect, and many snake charmers claim Kanipa as their root guru. In one anecdote a tantric feast was hosted by Matsyendranath and Goraknath and each participant was free to choose his own food. Kanipa's chosen dish was cooked snakes and scorpi ons, and he was promptly banished from the feast. In the Buddhist legend of Kanipa his untimely death was due to being cursed by a dakini. On his deathbed he taught the headless Vajra Varahi sadhanama deity assimilated with the headless Mahavidya goddess Chinnamastra. 

He is represented in a smashan wearing bone ornaments, holding a skull cup, double-sided drum and tantric staff. Above his head float seven drums and canopies, which often spontaneously manifested as signs of his accom plishment. He is seated upon the resurrected corpse of a vetala (vampire or ghoul).
