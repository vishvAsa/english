Yantra, meaning "device" or "instrument," is usually a geometric repre sentation designed to identify the mind of a worshipper with his or her cho sen deity. The Yogini Tantra says that the goddess may either be worshipped as image, mandala or yantra. A yantra is the outward form of a deity, while a mantra is the deities' subtle form. In essence the mantra is the deity, and when a yantra is inscribed with its bija mantras and empowered by conse cration the deity is installed within the yantra. Empowerment is the entry of the deities' prana into the yantra, and without this the yantra is but an empty construction. When a yantra is consecrated by auspicious rites it brings prosperity and peace and removes all malevolent influences from the worshippers family. Yantras can be used for magical purposes and when employed in destructive rituals the yantra becomes more a prison than a palace for the deity.

Intersecting squares may house the center which usually rest on the circular bed of a lotus. Outside this in con centric circles are the petals of the lotus which normally number eight or sixteen.

Yantras are inscribed on various materials according to their use and the function they perform. For peaceful and magnetizing rites: rock crystal and birch bark are often used; for enriching: gold, silver or copper plate; for destructive rituals: iron, skin or bone is employed. The metal plate is often smeared with a paste such as sandalwood, saffron or alce, and inscribed with a stylus of gold, wood, iron, or thom taken from shrubs such as acacia, bael or datura, depending again on the ritual for which it is used. Three dimensional yantras are sometimes commissioned for their enduring influ ences of peace and prosperity, skilfully carved from such precious materials as rock crystal, coral or lapis lazuli.
