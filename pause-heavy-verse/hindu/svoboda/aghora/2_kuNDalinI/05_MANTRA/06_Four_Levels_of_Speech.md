title = "06 Four Levels of Speech"

"Of course the Rishis and their disciples knew how to pronounce Sanskrit properly." 

“Yes they did, and they knew other things as well, including how to best make use of all four levels of speech." As I racked my brain for any informa tion I might have collected on that subject, he continued. “You know, speech is not a product of the mind; speech is an independent creative fac ulty, a sense which operates through the mind. Kundalini is the power of an individual's self-expression, which means that speech is simply the verbal expression of Kundalini. This is why the lotuses of the chakras have Bija Mantras for petals, and why mantras are so important for awakening Kun dalini. 

"What sort of speech you use will be determined by where your Kundalini happens to be when you speak. As long as Kundalini is still asleep, or pre dominantly so, you will speak mainly in gross verbal speech, the speech used habitually by so-called normal people. As She awakens, your speech becomes progressively subtle. The sort of manifestation you can generate with your mantra depends on the sort of speech you use when you repeat it. Whatever a Rishi speaks will come to pass, because Rishis speak divine words. God's Word is very different from your words or my words because God's ability to create is very different from yours or mine. 

“The four levels of speech are, from lowest to highest, Vaikhari, Madhyama, Pashyanti and Para. Vaikhari, vocal speech, is only for mundane

things; it is physical speech, which always has an external object. Dullards and ignoramuses like you and me use Vaikhari to communicate. Vaikhari is only useful for living beings; once you are dead you can no longer hear Vaikhari. You can hear the thoughts of those you left behind, but not their words, which is probably just as well, since so often humans say one thing when they really mean another. 

“Madhyama, as its name suggests, is midway between the mundane and the spiritual. People who have good intentions use Madhyama, which is mental speech, so its object is internal. Pashyanti is only for spiritual things. Pashyanti means 'seeing'-seeing with the divine eye, clairvoyance. Actu ally, it is not seeing; it is perception, because the physical organ of sight plays no part or a very minor part in it. The eye acts only as a vehicle for this perception. Immortal beings like Naths and Munis who are aware of the sig nificance of what they speak use Pashyanti. And Para is meant only for Rishis. It is beyond perception; it is telepathic speech, the highest. 

“In Satya Yuga almost everyone communicates telepathically by using Para. Even in Satya Yuga, though, there are a few bad apples in the barrel, a few people whose consciousnesses are relatively impure, whose natures are more animalistic than the others'. These people use Pashyanti and Madhyama, which are still basically non-verbal forms of communication but are grosser than Para. When most people in the world can no longer com municate by Para you know that Satya Yuga is over. Satya Yuga is satya, truth ful, because of Para, which can never be false. Satya Yuga lasts for eons because it is so full of truth. 

“People can do better sadhana in Satya Yuga than we can now because they can speak in Para. Anything spoken in Para is millions of times more powerful than anything spoken in any other form of speech, especially Vaikhari. You should never express your love for anyone in Vaikhari; the fire in your tongue will only burn it. If you want to express love, whether for a person or a deity, always use at least Madhyama, if not Pashyanti or Para. 

“This is why kissing is so wonderful. When kissing you cannot repeat your mantra in Vaikhari, and you may not remember to repeat it in Madhyama either; probably whatever you communicate will be in some thing higher. Just as in Vajroli (sexual yoga), give and take of energy is possi ble through kissing. Passing energy through a kiss is one hundred times easier than passing energy through Vajroli because much less energy is involved. If you have the intention to share your energy with someone when you kiss them, even if you have no idea of the technique, some transmission will occur, though it will be less efficient.

AGHORA II: Kundalini 

“Kissing with the lips still leads to loss of energy, however. Some energy does get transmitted, but most is lost because the attention gets trapped in the softness of the lips. In the past people used to kiss only on the forehead. As time went on they gradually moved down the face until they got to the lips. Kissing with the lips usually leads to sexual intercourse; the upper and lower lips are related. Kissing so that the underside of the tongue is involved stirs up the most energy because of the many nerves there. But what is the use of stirring up a lot of energy if you can't communicate well in Pashyanti or Para? Then very little of your energy will be successfully transmitted dur ing intercourse; most of it will be burned off in passion. This is Kali Yuga, when Maya, including especially the Maya of the body, is very strong. 

“Vaikhari, Madhyama and Pashyanti are predominated by Tamas, Rajas, and Sattva respectively. Since the world as we know it, Maya, is the result of these Three Gunas, the use of these three forms of speech is limited, imper fect, because they all exist within Maya. The state beyond the Gunas is the state beyond Maya. That state is perfect because it is absolute, and that is Para. There is no need for mantra in Para; mantras arise as the intent filters down into the grosser levels of existence. 

“Look at it this way, with the help of the sacred syllable Om. The three and a half coils of the Kundalini represent the three and a half letters of the word Om: a, u, m, and anusvara (nasalization) at the end. But Om also has a bindu (orthographic dot) over the anusvara. Anusvara and bindu cannot exist without one another. Bindu is a point: position without dimension, as they define it in mathematics. Anusvara is pronounceable in Vaikhari and Madhyama, but bindu can be 'pronounced only in Pashyanti and Para. How do you pronounce a dot? You can't; but the intention to pronounce it can be present. 

"Intention counts for nothing in Vaikhari; a clever con artist can have you in tears while he is laughing inside over how easily he has duped you. Inten tion counts for something in Madhyama, and for a lot in Pashyanti. But intention counts for everything in Para. In fact, Para is nothing but inten tion: the purified intention of a purified ego, a Kundalini Shakti which has been magnified millions of times by intense penance. Bindu is used when the Kundalini moves from the Vishuddha Chakra into the Ajna Chakra, when Shunya begins. That is the very nature of bindu: emptiness, which is the source of all sound, the field from which sound arises." 

It seemed complex, so Vimalananda provided me with an Ayurvedic image. 

“Here is another way to look at it. What is the word for 'sweet' in Sanskrit?"

MANTRA 

“Swadu, or madhura." 

"Of all the sweet things in the world only honey is called madhu, because only honey can offer sweetness to the body without being digested first. This is because honey has already been digested by the bees. Madhura has an extra 'ra' in it; that 'ra' refers to the Fire Element. Anything that is madhura must first be digested before its sweetness can be released into the system. Of all forms of speech only Para is truly madhu, Para goes directly to its target and exerts its effect immediately, just as honey does in the body. All other speech must first be digested by the hearer before its effect can be felt. Pashyanti is always madhura, at least, and Madhyama usually is, which is why they are so useful. But Vaikhari is only sometimes sweet, because it is under the control of all Six Tastes. This is why sometimes we speak sweetly, and at other times our words are sharp, or bitter, or sour, or salty, or cold and hard."
