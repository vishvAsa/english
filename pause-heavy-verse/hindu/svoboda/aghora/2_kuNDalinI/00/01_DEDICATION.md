She, the Eternal One, is the Supreme Knowledge, the cause of freedom from 

O delusion and the cause of the bondage of manifestation. 

She indeed is sovereign over all sovereigns. 

(Devi Mahatmya, 1.57-58) 

Dedicated to the Great Goddess, the Divine Mother of the Universe: 

the Kundalini Shakti.
