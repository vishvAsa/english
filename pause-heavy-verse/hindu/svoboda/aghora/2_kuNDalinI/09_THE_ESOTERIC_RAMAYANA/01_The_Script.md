"We would never have had the Ramayana at all had it not been for the Rishi Valmiki and his concern over how to spread out the karmas he had incurred through his chosen profession. Valmiki was not born a Rishi; in fact, he was a bandit. His job was waylaying people and robbing them. Sometimes he would hold them for ransom, or even kill them. Occasionally he would let them go. One day Valmiki caught the celestial troublemaker Narada, and told him that he would have to die because he had nothing of value to steal. 

“Narada told him, 'All right, I am ready to die, but please tell me why you rob people. 

“Valmiki replied, 'Because I have to feed my family.' 

“Narada then asked him, 'Do you think that they are all as willing to share in your karmas as they are to share in your income?' 

“Valmiki said, 'Of course they are!' But deep inside his mind doubt sud denly took root. Narada told him, “Before you kill me and add to the weight of your karmas, why don't you first make sure that your family is willing to share them with you?' 

“Valmiki returned to his home to inquire and got the shock of his lifetime when one after another his family members refused to have anything to do with his bad karmas. His parents told him, 'We raised you and supported you while you were growing up; now you have to pay us back. We don't care where the money comes from; that is your problem.' 

“His wife said, 'I have borne your children and run your household. You owe me a living, and I am not interested in how you provide it. All your kar

mas are your responsibility.' His children informed him, 'We never asked to be born here. You have created us, and now you have to look after us at your own expense. You will have to worry about your karmas yourself.' 

"A shaken Valmiki retumed to Narada, who had of course foreseen what would happen. Narada then taught Valmiki about how devotion to Vishnu can eliminate bad karmas. Because Valmiki could not pronounce Sanskrit correctly he could not repeat “Rama, Rama,' so Narada ordered him to repeat ‘mara, mara,' instead. Mara means ‘killer,' which was something Valmiki could relate to. 

“Both ‘mara' and 'Rama' have the same letters, the same Bija Mantras, which means there must be a definite connection between them. There is also a definite difference in effect between them, due to the order in which the letters are pronounced, in the same way that there is both a connection and a difference between 'Hara' (Shiva) and 'raha' (secret). 

“Valmiki sat down and began to recite. He sat in one position for sixty thousand years without moving. Ant hills grew over him..." 

He paused, I interjected: “Naturally, since 'Valmiki' means 'he who lives in a valmika (an anthill or termite mound).' 

“That's right. By repeating ‘mara, mara' at top speed Valmiki actually started to repeat 'Rama, Rama.' When he finally emerged he was a Rishi. 

“The Ramayana was composed long before it ever happened. First the Rishis got together and decided that they wanted a certain type of Lila. Then they commissioned Valmiki to write the script. It was just like writing the script of a drama or a movie for him. Actually it was even simpler; he simply opened himself up, and the senior Rishis wrote the Ramayana through him." 

“So his sadhana made him a vessel fit to hold the shakti that the Rishis wanted to manifest in the world through him." 

"Yes. This is what I mean when I say that the Rishis are the puppetmasters and we are merely the puppets. They decide what is to happen and then arrange for it to happen. The events that followed the writing of the Rama yana were entirely preordained. And people think there is such a thing as free will." 

“So there is no such thing as free will?" 

“There is really no such thing as free will for beings like us. Until you become a Rishi your options are to follow the script or not to follow it, and if you don't follow the script you will eventually regret it. You can however choose just how you will follow the script, if your will is strong enough.”

THE ESOTERIC RAMAYANA 

“Will is the power to direct the mind, especially when there are contrary thoughts or tendencies within it. The mind governs the senses and the senses dominate the body through the nervous system. If the mind is untrained, as it is in most people, the will loses its authority and the body functions stupidly. You know that it is bad for your health to eat a thick juicy steak, and yet you do it. Your tongue overrides your willpower. You know that sleeping with a prostitute may give you a disease as a fringe benefit, but you go ahead and do it because your penis overrides your will. This is a type of mental impotence, an inability to control your actions, and it leads inevi tably to unhappiness and frustration. 

“All spiritual progress exists in the cultivation of a controlled mind. I am not talking about a closed mind, one which suppresses its desires. I am talk ing about a conditioned mind which maintains close watch over the senses by force of will. This is why I so love Anjaneya. He is immortal, he is a super man, and yet his mind is always focused on Rama, and his will is always subordinated to the will of Rama. 

“Take a leaf from Anjaneya's book, and learn some humility,” he said, focusing his gaze firmly on me. “Very few people know that Anjaneya actu ally introduced the story of the Ramayana to the world for the first time. He wrote his version with his fingernails on blocks of stone. After some time he realized that if his version became popular it would interfere with the fame of Valmiki's version, and he also understood that in Kali Yuga no one would be able to understand his Sanskrit properly, so he threw those blocks into the sea at Rameshwaram. They are still there somewhere, underwater. What did he care for name or fame? He cared only for Rama, so he could afford to be generous." 

Mentally I bowed to the will of Rama. 

“From one angle, episodes from the Ramayana take place every day in everyone's body. If people knew about this they would marvel at it. The Ramayana has seven divisions called Kandas which represent the Six Tastes in the body plus the one Parama Rasa, or Supreme Taste. Which Kanda you relive depends on which Taste you experience. If you are overwhelmed with lust, you relive the kidnapping of Sita by Ravana, and so on. But there is more. 

"The story of the Ramayana is the story of the spiritual progress of an individual soul. All of us have the main characters of the drama present within us, and all of us who do sadhana live through the same sort of trials and tribulations that Rama and Sita had to endure. Rama, Sita and the rest had their own personalities, and therefore their own Kundalinis, but they

also represent actors in the epic which is performed by everyone who does Kundalini Yoga. If you want to try to grasp the hidden meanings that exist within the story, and understand how it might affect you, first try to under stand the characters.
