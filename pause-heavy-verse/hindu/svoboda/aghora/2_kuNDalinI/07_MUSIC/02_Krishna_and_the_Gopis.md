He described it one evening shortly thereafter, over Scotch. 

“My family belongs to the Pushti Marga, the spiritual path (marga) whose greatest exponent was Vallabhacharya, who lived more than five hundred years ago. Some people translate 'Pushti Marga' as 'Path of Prosperity,' and others as ‘Path of Grace.' But when I think of pushti I remember a phrase from the Maha Mrytunjaya Mantra.” He looked at me expectantly. 

"You mean, 'sugandhim pushti vardhanam?" I asked. 

“Yes. The Maha Mrytunjaya Mantra is addressed to Lord Shiva, the God of Death. When you repeat it you are requesting Him to preserve your life and enhance your welfare. Vallabhacharya's philosophy is called Shuddha Advaita, 'Pure Non-duality,' and follows the principle of 'One-in-All, All-in One.' Vallabhacharya never taught people to run away from the world and become renunciates; he taught everyone to live a Vedic life, to live in the world without becoming part of the world.” 

“So this is also Advaita Vedanta?" 

“Most certainly! Thus far you have been exposed only to the Advaita of Shankaracharya, and the proponents of that school want people to believe that theirs is the only Advaita Vedanta. They like to debate reality; it's only natural, since that is what Shankaracharya did his whole life long. 

“Shankaracharya taught 'Brhamam sat, jagan mithya’: while the Absolute Unmanifested is absolutely true, the cosmos, the Manifested, is mithya, false. But Vallabhacharya believed, as we Aghoris believe, that since God 

(191) 

AGHORA II: Kundalini 

created the universe, and pervades it, the universe is as true as God is, which means that everything is true, since everything is part and parcel of God. Vallabhacharya did not care too much for debate; he preferred to spend his time worshipping Krishna and enjoying the bliss of the nectar of His sweet name and form. I like to call the Pushti Marga ‘the Path of Sweet ness,' because of the many sweet songs Vallabhacharya wrote, in Sanskrit, about his Beloved. Probably the most famous of Vallabhacharya's songs is the Madhura-ashtaka, the 'Eight Verses in Praise of the Lord's Sweetness.' Of all deities only Krishna is Madhu: pure, unalloyed sweetness. In fact, one of His names is Madhava, the 'Sweet One." 

"Why isn't this sect better known?” 

"Well, there is a lot of esoteric meaning in their doctrine, which makes it too complicated to explain easily. The Gaudiya Math, from which the Hare Krishnas developed, teaches devotion to Krishna in His exoteric, external form, and rejects any kind of esoteric doctrine; this makes it easier to com prehend. The Pushti Marga believes both in the obvious and the hidden, and that is why I think it is superior, not just because I was born into it. If Westerners were to study Vallabhacharya's teachings they would really learn something about Advaita Vedanta, about the hidden meanings of Krishna's play, and about how to be sweet. 

"Krishna was something else entirely,” said Vimalananda appreciatively, shaking his head in amazement. “You know, the word Krishna has two and a half syllables, and so does the word prema (romantic love). So it is only nat ural for Krishna's play to be full of prema. But He is no ordinary lover. In fact, He is a true thug; that's why He is called Chaliya, 'the Inconstant One.' He will play about with you when you worship Him. Some days He will be very close; other days you won't be able to find Him at all. 

“As He plays with you, you will be run through the wringer; you will ache with longing. When He finishes with His play you will be completely tired out. You will cry with all your being, 'When are You coming to me?' When He does come He will catch hold of your hand and will never let go, not even through millions of births-except that there can't be millions of births for you once He has hold of your hand. Finally you reach the state of tadrupata—'two hearts but one beat'-and then you are identical with Him, if that is what you want. But most devotees of Krishna never want to unite with Him; they always want to maintain their own identities so that they taste His sweetness over and over again, forever and ever. 

“Although He is Perfection Personified, Krishna still has to come to our world to play about. Do you know why? Because of His beloved, Radha. 

( 192 ) 

MUSIC 

Why does the name Radha sound so sweet to the ear? Turn the word around and you get dhara, the power to hold or fix. In this case it is the power to hold Krishna in mind. Everyone who has perfect dharana of Krishna, whose mind is firmly fixed on Him, actually calls Krishna to them. He goes wherever He is called. The person who calls may not see or sense Him, but Krishna plays about with such a person, and causes him or her to do so many things. 

“Krishna is called Perfection Personified because of a siddhi he had which was far beyond all ordinary siddhis. This siddhi is called “Kartum, Akartum, Anyathakartum.' Kartum; that which is difficult to do, but is doable. This refers to the adhibhautika, the mundane world. Akartum: that which is impossible for ordinary beings, which refers to the adhyatmika, the spiritual world. Anyathakartum: that which is beyond both the spiritual and the mundane and is inconceivable to humans, referring to the adhidaivika or astral world. This suggests that Lord Krishna has unlimited power in all three realms, which means in the entire cosmos. Krishna had only one fault: He had a habit of promising to do the impossible. He would set up a situa tion, promise to change it, and then change it-and no one would know what He had done. All the time this was going on He would stand to one side, admiring His own play. 

“But even Krishna was baffled by Radha; even He could not understand her. Do you know the depth of Radha's devotion to Krishna? Even Krishna Himself could not know it. Her bhakti was so intense that when she was away from Krishna she felt as if she were being stung by thousands of scor pions all at once. If you want to awaken your Kundalini completely by means of bhakti your devotion must be equally intense, otherwise there will 

never be enough pressure to force Kundalini to rise into your head." 

Oh. 

“Radha was a gopi, one of the milkmaids with whom Krishna carried on a secret romance. They would work all day long taking care of their homes and families, and when night fell they would sneak out and make love to Krishna. Esoterically, Krishna is the Soul, the Shaktiman; the gopis are the nadis, the nerves of the astral body. Gopi literally means 'secret”; naturally, because no one else but the sadhaka can know what is going on within his body. The gopis went about their daily work as usual, but their thoughts were only of Krishna. Likewise, a good sadhaka goes about his own daily life while his consciousness is fixed entirely on Krishna. 

“They say that Krishna had sixteen thousand wives, and of those sixteen thousand He was fondest of one hundred. This means that of your seventy 

( 193 ) 

AGHORA II: Kundalini 

two thousand nadis sixteen thousand are predominant, and of those sixteen thousand one hundred are most important in Kundalini Yoga. Of these, three are supremely important, and of these three Sushumna is most impor tant. Radha, the most beloved of Krishna even though she was not even His wife, represents Sushumna. 

“Do you remember when I demonstrated to you and your friend Sergei how through the manipulation of just one nadi in the second toe a woman can become aroused, and even have an orgasm?” 

“I remember it well.” And so does, I am sure, the woman he demon strated it on. 

"Can you imagine what would happen if all your seventy-two thousand nadis were stimulated at once?" 

"I can imagine it with some difficulty.” 

"Well, that is what love of Krishna can do for you. If that ever happens to you then you will know something about Krishna's Lila. Do you know the two main Sanskrit words for 'play? 

“Yes, lila and krida.” 

“Krida is unconscious play, like rati krida (love play). Krida is play which is controlled by someone or something other than the being who is playing. In love play the glands and the genitals do the controlling, not the two peo ple who romance each other. The Rishis play is lila, cosmic pastimes in which they are always in control. This is why we talk about Krishna's Lila and Rama's Lila, the divine play of Lord Krishna and Lord Rama. 

“Everyone here in India knows when Krishna was born, but how many people know the real significance of Krishna's birth? Only when the causal body begins to burn to ash is Krishna really born. At that time the Kundalini Shakti merges with its Lord in the sadhaka's head, and then all the seventy two thousand nadis begin to dance in the cosmic rhythm. Each nadi vibrates with bliss, thinking that she alone possesses Krishna, but in fact Krishna being the Soul is everywhere, and dances with them all. This is the way the Rishis celebrate Krishna's birthday: they enjoy the cosmic dance between Krishna and the gopis in their own bodies, utilizing the Kundalini Shakti. This is the real Rasa-Lila of Krishna." 

"So it is at least theoretically possible to experience the Rasa-Lila (the divine dance of intense emotion), even now during Kali-Yuga.” 

“Let me put it this way. When Narsi Mehta was kicked out of the house by his sister-in-law he ran in desperation to a Shiva temple and threw him self across the Shiva Linga. He lay there for seven days and nights, forgetting 

[194] 

MUSIC 

to eat or drink, allowing snakes and insects to crawl over him as they pleased. Finally Lord Shiva was pleased with his penance, and appeared to him to offer a boon. Narsi Mehta told Him, 'Lord, just give me whatever you like best.' Shiva said, 'Well, I love best the Rasa-Lila of Krishna, so I will give that to you.' Some people say that Narsi Mehta is the only human in Kali Yuga who has ever seen the real Rasa-Lila of Lord Krishna." 

“Of course that is too faraway for most of us,” he added when he saw the far away look in my eyes. “But if you sing of Krishna's exploits with sincere devotion you can develop intense love for Krishna, which will give you immense bliss. And if you know the esoteric meaning behind the songs, they can send you into ecstasy. 

“In one a gopi complains to her companion: 'On the banks of the river Yamuna, Nanda's son (Krishna) flung a stone and broke the water pot on my head, which caused all the water to flow out and lighten my load.' You know that Indians frequently carry their heavy loads on their heads. The gopis, like most Indian women, used to fetch water from the river in large pots which they would carefully balance on their heads as they carried them back to their homes. Krishna, to tease them, would throw rocks and break the pots. This is the surface meaning, easily understandable by every woman who has ever carried a pot of water on her head. Such a song thus helps even illiterate village women to increase their devotion to Krishna. 

“When you sympathize with someone you self-identify with that person to some extent. If you can sympathize with the gopi in this song it will be easier for you to relate to Krishna, even if it is only to scold Him for breaking the pot. We in India do not believe that devotion has to be respectful and polite at all times. When you are in love with someone, is the course of your romance always smooth? No, it is not; it can't be, if you are really in love. Sometimes you will fight, sometimes you will weep, and so on, if you really love your partner. True devotion means falling in love with your deity. 

“So, the gopi in the song seems to complain about Krishna's antics; this is the surface meaning. The esoteric meaning is something quite different. Never take anything here in India only at surface value. Our sacred writings are mostly esoteric and you should not take them at face value any more than you should take the books of Moses, which are also mostly esoteric, at face value. 

“In this song the Yamuna River represents the Chandra Nadi, which flows in the left nostril. Bhakti requires the functioning of the Chandra Nadi. The gopis are the other nadis of the body. Krishna is the gopis' lover; He is the Soul, that which causes vitality and awareness in the nadis. The 

(195] 

AGHORA II: Kundalini 

Soul also causes blood to flow in the arteries, and so on. Doesn't your blood flow faster when you see your beloved? 

“The water por is the head, which is full of so many juices. "Juice' is not limited to physical juices like hormones; it also includes 'mental' juices like tastes and emotions. Because an unenlightened person is selfish this water is poisonous, poisoned by the venom of selfishness." 

"From the snake of the untamed ahamkara," I tossed in. 

He nodded, pleased that I was following his meaning. “Krishna 'lightens' the gopi of her burden, making her ‘enlightened.' After her head is light ened of the venom of the world the gopi becomes clairaudient and clairvoy ant. Then all she wants to see is Krishna, all she wants to hear is the sweet music of His flute, and all she wants to do is dance with Him in the divine Rasa-Lila. 

"Once Krishna hid in a tree near the Yamuna and waited for the gopis to come down to bathe. After they had undressed and entered the river Krishna stole their clothes, and when they realized what He had done they were too embarrassed to come out. But Krishna insisted, and they all had to emerge from the water and stand before Him naked." 

“Naturally He wanted to see them naked; He was their lover.” 

“Yes. Before Krishna will dance with the gopis they must remove all their clothes: the three coverings which obscure Kundalini. The gopis are embar rassed in the beginning--their egos hesitate to leave familiar self-identifica tions—but Krishna is firm with them, and eventually they must become naked. Then the Kundalini Shakti becomes free to move through the various nadis in the body, and those nadis begin to dance."
