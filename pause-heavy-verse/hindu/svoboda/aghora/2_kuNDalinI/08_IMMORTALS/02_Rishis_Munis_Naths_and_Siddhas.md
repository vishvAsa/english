After pausing to light a cigarette, Vimalananda continued. 

“To become a Siddha is wonderful-marvelous--but it is not the ulti mate. If your Kundalini should ever reach the Sahasrara you will see so many things that you will be amazed. You will see hundreds and hundreds of flow ers of all colors. Each of those flowers is a shakti, and if you pluck one of them you will get that shakti, which will keep you on the periphery. You will form a little orbit for yourself, and you may remain there for ages. Siddhas usually stay in their own orbits because they are so fascinated by what they have achieved. Only if they are forcibly pulled further by some higher authority will they move ahead, and when they do they see that there are much better orbits to move into. 

"To progress as a Siddha you must forget about everything else except going closer and closer to the center. It is almost impossible to reach the center, which is the preserve of the seniormost of the Rishis, but you can get closer and closer to it. If at any time you decide you've had enough of exist ence, you can completely efface your personality and merge into the center.” 

I strained to conceptualize it. "Try to get some perspective on what I am talking about here. Even after you become a Siddha it takes time to progress further. Of course, a Mahapu rusha, who has gone beyond time, space and causation has no value for time; but to you and me it seems impossibly long. After thousands of years of penance a Siddha may be permitted to meet a Nath and learn from him. If a Siddha works really hard he can even become a Nath. 

“Naths are Aghoris. They make everything in their being self-identify with Lord Shiva even under the most trying and tempting circumstances. Their

motto is ‘Alak Niranjan”; Alak means 'a-laksha,' 'free from attribution or dis crimination.' Nir-anjana means 'completely clean, free of any fault, stain or blemish. What is that thing which is undefined and undefiled? The absolute imperishable Brahman. 

“Most people would be terrified to see a Nath in his real form, with mat ted locks, big firetongs, bag full of ashes and fierce unblinking eyes.” 

“So all the Nath sadhus who dress this way are actually dressing in imita tion of the real Naths, the immortals?" 

“Yes, and each part of their costume has some meaning behind it; it's not just fanciful. Nath sadhus are known as ‘Kan-Phatas' ('Pierced-Ears') because of the large earrings they are given by their gurus when they are ini tiated. The earrings stay in for as long as the sadhu lives, and the rule used to be that if an earring should break the sadhu should immediately commit suicide. I suspect that very few Nath sadhus follow this rule nowadays. Does the word 'earring' remind you of anything?" 

“It reminds me of Kundalini, since kundala means 'earring.'” 

“Correct. So there is a connection between the earring and Kundalini, or more precisely, between where the ear is pierced and Kundalini. The ear is full of important nadis, which is why the Chinese have gone in for ear acu puncture in such a big way. Nath sadhus are expected to be celibate, and one reason why they pierce their ears is because when you pierce the ear lobe in just the right place you can prevent hydrocele, which may become a complication of celibacy. Of course if you are slightly off target you will become permanently impotent, so it is better to know before you pierce.” 

“If they are supposed to remain celibate what difference does it make if they become impotent; on the contrary, that should make them happy, shouldn't it?” 

“Think about it; if they lose their sexual energy entirely, what will they have left to use to help awaken Kundalini?” 

"Oh, right.” You have to be virile to practice Tantra. 

“The immortal Naths are passionately devoted to their guru Dattatreya, and they dress as they do in honor of Adi Nath, the first Nath: Lord Shiva. Thus Shiva is not the guru here; He is a fellow disciple of Dattatreya, the first of all Aghoris. Can you imagine what sort of being Dattatreya is if his original pupil was Shiva Himself?” 

I tried to imagine Lord Dattatreya. 

“Wah, wah," said Vimalananda admiringly, “Naths are really ‘naths' (mas ters). They are masters of the ten senses. A special nerve is created, the elev enth sense, which permits them to receive their instructions telepathically. 

12101IMMORTALS 

Naths are higher than Siddhas because they get telepathic transmissions directly from their bosses, the Munis. This is why Naths are always waiting for adesha, for instructions: “That which is heard without the ears, seen without the eyes, spoken without the tongue. 

"Because they are immortal and have complete control over their senses, Naths are masters of the physical world also. Just by pissing, or even spit ting, on a rock a Nath can produce gold. In alchemy you have to use metal as your raw material, but a Nath only needs a rock. He has eaten and digested all types of poisons, which has changed his metabolism so much that he has become a touchstone himself. So naturally a Nath will have no value for gold, or for people like kings who do value it. They only have value for the gold of pure consciousness. A Nath is really a spiritual touchstone. Whoever comes in contact with a Nath must become spiritual, must become a real man or woman of God whether they want to or not. This is the power of a Nath. 

“The Naths have a different way of teaching altogether. Once while Gorakh Nath was sitting at his dhuni he saw that the king's wife had died and that the king was crying as if his world had come to an end. Gorakh decided to go and meet the king. He brought along an earthen pot, and when he entered the king's presence he suddenly dropped it. It shattered into a hundred pieces, and Gorakh began to wail, 'I have lost my beautiful pot that I loved so dearly! Now it is gone forever! 

“The king looked at him in amazement and said, 'Have you gone mad? Are you crying over an old pot? You can buy hundreds of them at the mar ker.' 

“Gorakh said to the king, ‘Maharaja, you are the ruler of the country, and in your harem there are many beautiful women. And besides, you can obtain any woman that you desire. Where is the need to cry over one lost woman? 

"The King replied, 'But she was so beautiful, so wonderful, and she had so many virtues that endeared her to me.' 

“In answer, Gorakh took some ash from his shoulder-bag and threw it on the ground. Immediately two living women appeared, each a perfect copy of the king's dead wife. Gorakh asked the king, 'Can you tell me which of these is yours? If you knew her so well, you should be able to recognize her.' 

“But the king couldn't distinguish which was his wife; both looked exactly alike. And then Gorakh said to him, “King, you cannot even recog nize your wife, and yet you are pining away for her. Now who is a fool, you or I?' And the king understood.

AGHORA II: Kundalini 

“The Naths are actually the creations of certain Munis, who in turn are merely the manifestations of a few Rishis. But each group in turn is kept in ignorance of their true nature so that the Lila, the cosmic play, can go on. They are limited in their new existences in order to perform certain tasks. If the Naths and Munis knew who they were, they wouldn't perform their duties properly. 

"A Nath waits millions of years to meet a Muni, and after long austerities a Nath can finally become a Muni. Actually, a Muni should be called “Mauni,' one who observes silence. He does not speak in Vaikhari at all; he commu nicates only with his eyes or telepathically. A Muni must wait Yugas or Man-a vantaras to catch even a glimpse of a Rishi, and then, if he is meant for it, after many billions of years of being a Muni he may get a chance to become a Rishi. The lower categories of Mahapurusha are all in orbit; each has his own orbit, but all are bound, however slightly. A Rishi, though, is totally free. He can travel to any star, any solar system he likes, in the twinkling of an eye.” 

“Does this apply to women too?" 

“A woman who succeeds to the attributeless state comes back as a Bhai ravi or Yogini; here also the hierarchy is very strict. After so many Yugas she moves up to become a Great Goddess, and finally she retires to the back ground, like the seniormost Rishis do, to let others enjoy the play. Actually those in the background control all the players, like a puppeteer pulling the puppets' strings. But no one is aware of it except the seniormost Shaktis and Shaktimans." 

A flicker of confused emotion crossed my face, and Vimalananda increased his vehemence. 

"Yes, I know what I am saying. The Rishis are the puppeteers, and all other beings in the universe, mortal and immortal, are their puppets. The Rishis go around creating rnas (karmic debts) for people to work off, to bind people down and help them progress. If you want to quit being a puppet, you must perform sadhana.
