Vimalananda delivered the next in this series of musings at a Ganesha temple. I can no longer recall which temple it was, for he was very fond of Ganesha and we paid regular visits to several images of the elephant-headed god. The area around Poona has been associated with Ganesha worship for centuries, and Ganesha is still one of the most beloved of deities of that region. 

After we had finished our worship and were relaxing, he began to address me thus: 

"You have to be able to deal with all sorts of temptations when you start to raise Kundalini, because your prana will try to move in unusual ways. This is why sadhana of Ganesha is so important. Ganesha is 'Gana' + 'Isha,' 'Lord of the Attendants.' Usually people think of the ganas as spirits who are Shiva's attendants, but in Kundalini Yoga the ganas are the sense organs. 

Ganesha is Lord of the Senses; He is also called the Remover of Obstacles, ham, because if He becomes pleased with you He will remove all obstacles from 

Kundalini's path as She rises. 

Shiva Yantra 

Ganesha Yantra “The Muladhara, where Kundalini sleeps, which is the seat of the Earth Element, of gross physicality, is ruled by Ganesha. This is why you must worship Ganesha before you worship any other deity. You must request Ganesha to permit you to go beyond your physical nature, to admit your

consciousness into the astral regions. Ganesha's blessing is essential for Kundalini to be able to leave the Muladhara Chakra. You know the story of Ganesha's birth, I think?" 

I did. “Parvati, Lord Shiva's Grand Consort, created Ganesha from the dirt on Her body to protect Her privacy while She bathed. Ganesha was on guard when Lord Shiva arrived and wanted to go in to His wife. Ganesha prevented Him from doing so, and since Shiva did not know who Ganesha was, a battle ensued, during which Shiva slew the boy. When Parvati came to know of this She became so enraged at the loss of Her child that She threatened to destroy the entire universe, and would have done so had Shiva not placated Her by replacing Ganesha's severed head with the head of an elephant. Then She calmed down." 

“And now what about the esoteric meaning?" “I'm not sure.” 

"Ask me about it. The name 'Parvati' means 'She Who is born from the mountains'—in this case, the chain of ‘mountains' known as the spine, within which resides the spinal cord. Parvati is the Kundalini Shakti. “Chain' is a good word to use here: until you awaken and free Kundalini, the spine acts as a chain to bind you down to earthly existence. Ganesha was created from the dirt on Her body—the Earth Element, the Element associated with the Muladhara Chakra. Shiva, the individual's consciousness, tries to break through to the dormant Kundalini by force, but this threatens to be the end of the sadhaka, because the Muladhara is the 'root support of the body. When Shiva realizes this He regenerates the Muladhara with the help of an elephant, a beast known for its intelligence. 

“If you want to awaken Kundalini, therefore, it is best to allow this intelli gence to direct the awakening, instead of barging in like a bull in a china shop and wreaking havoc on yourself. Instead of meditating on the Muladhara Chakra and trying to forcibly open it, it is wiser to transform it, with Ganesha's help. 

“Now here's a question for you: how did it happen that Lord Shiva, Who knows past, present, and future, Who is Parvati's husband—how did it happen that He could not even recognize His own son?” 

A good question. I couldn't open my mouth. 

“Think about it for a while. You know, Ganesha is one of the gentlest of gods, if properly approached, most helpful and very sweet. But He can also get upset. He is a small child, and you know how children can be when they become angry. And think of how wild elephants can be when they become angry! When Ganesha does lose His temper He changes in a moment from

the Remover of Obstacles to the Creator of Obstacles and then you are in real trouble. 

"Once I gave a man a Ganesha mantra and told him that after forty days of repeating it Ganesha would come and stand in front of him.” 

I knew this story well, but Vimalananda's tone of intense seriousness alerted me to his strong desire for me to listen to it yet again. 

“Unfortunately something happened to break his niyama before the forty days were up, so I ordered him to start all over again. Finally, after he com pleted forty days, nothing happened. I told him, 'You are very close now; don't stop. Continue it for just a few days more.' 

“The man said, “Look, this is all foolishness, there is nothing behind it. I can't stand being away from my wife. I am going home now to have some good sex. 

“I warned him, 'You've gone too far for that now. Ganesha will become very angry if you do that, and I won't be able to save you. Just do it for three more days and I guarantee that you'll succeed.' 

“What more could he have wanted? It was only a question of three days. But Mahakala, the God of Death, must have already grabbed hold of him. He told me, 'No, I'm through listening to you. I've really got to have some sex. Good-bye!' 

“At first his wife tried to prevent him from climbing on top of her, but he forced his way into her anyway and enjoyed her, twice. Satisfied with his labors he fell asleep. 

“In a dream he saw an enraged elephant charging at him. He tried to run but it was useless. When the tusker caught up with him he gave the man a solid blow to the jaw with his trunk. The next morning the man's entire face, jaw and all, was swollen to twice its normal size. He was taken to the hospital. The doctors couldn't find out what was wrong with him. I went to the hospital too, and he asked me, from his hospital bed, if I could rescue him. But there was nothing I could do, because his nervous system was blown to shreds. It was too late; he had gone too far. He died that night. After that experience I decided I would only assist people in their own sadhanas, and never suggest new sadhanas to anyone. 

“Iron discipline is necessary whenever you commit to a sadhana; without it something is sure to go wrong. So don't start trying for this kind of perfec tion of a mantra unless you are so obstinate that you will finish it. If you decide that you must have meat for a few days, or that you must have drinks or sex, then you are ruined. Not only will you never succeed, but you will have to suffer for trying to act smart. If you know your willpower is limited it

is better not to do anything at all. To break your vow and then say, 'Oh, I'll ask forgiveness of God and He will look the other way,' is only cheating yourself, no one else. Once you commit yourself to a sadhana you are really at risk unless you finish it off properly.” 

“Do you mean that God will not forgive any mistakes?" 

"Of course not! God is always ready to forgive, if you go to him with humility. But there is nothing humble about this sort of sadhana; you are demanding attention from God. You are saying, 'Come on; I want to play with you on your terms.' If you tell God that, then you had better be ready for whatever God wants to dish out.”
