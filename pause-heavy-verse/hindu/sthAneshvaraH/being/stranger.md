The Stranger  
Every knock on the door,  
Wakes me up,  
Disrupting slumber,  
Forcing me to peep through the window,  
Reluctant to open the door.  

Tik, tik, tik,  
Comes the knock again,  
Chilling the spine,  
But nothing is there except for darkness,  
Just darkness swallowed into darkness,  
Kalidasa tries to pierce through darkness,  
I just throw a rock and go back to bed,  
No dreams other than the knocks,  
For every pulsation becomes the beats,  
Every line of wrinkle becomes the knock,  
Every single gray hair counts the tik,  
The faceless nobody becomes real,  
A real stranger,  
Nameless and faceless stranger,  
Keeps calling me from the other side!
