title = "Pain"

When you pour like the hailstones,  
Or pierce through the skin like the needles,  
Or you burn like fire under the feet,  
I find in you my only friend.  

In my worst days of solitude,  
And the days of tragedies.  

You are the only one that I count on.  
You caressed my body along the wind,  
When I counted stars with the street dogs,  
When the world shattered and broke,  
You put myself as if together.  

As a shadow of my being,  
You sleep in far shores of my joy.  
Waiting to crawl back,  
And cut me to pieces again.  

In every wish and all desires,  
You glue yourself inseparable.  
In their birth and in their death,  
You extend like a changeless base.  

You snatch like a hungry beast,  
With your jaws and piercing paws,  
For every battle that is there,  
You win over and over forever.
