title = "Last Petal"
+++

Like a Samurai,  
The last rose in the garden,  
Kept fighting for survival,  
To defy the wheel of time.

And with the last petal,  
Gave me the last smile,  
It stood up against scorching heat,  
But gave up to a gentle breeze.

A fallen petal does not come back,  
But there will be new buds when the season comes.
