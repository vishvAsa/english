Forgetting
Forms as if vanish sometimes,  
With just names in the heart,  
Repeating after the beats,  
Aching and agonizing beats,  
Itching like the old scars.  

And some enduring forms,  
Vanishing forms with blurry names,  
Fire crackles with intermittent flares,  
Mind wonders to name the whisper,  
The whisper of birth and of death.  

Caught among the nameless feels,  
Hooked in the memory of pain.  
Like the footprints after a rain,  
Unknowable something,  
Nameless and faceless something,  
A feel without a name,  
The aroma with a missing label.  
Wondering where to stack it.  

Oh forgetting, you let memory take your glory.  
For thy love for thy children, the memories,  
Some savored and others gone,  
Some nameless and faceless ones,  
The less agonizing ones.
