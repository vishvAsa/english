Every night is the celebration of light,  
As paradox is part of our being.  
It is in the dark that we see the fire-flies glow,  
Every drop counts in the desert.  
When one darkness leads to another,  
And death to another death,  
And the night unfolds into a nightmare.  
Hope is our company to shatter the chain.
