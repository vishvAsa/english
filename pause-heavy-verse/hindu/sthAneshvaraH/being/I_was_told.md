I was told  
not to walk on grass or move rocks  
for they also had the right to be the way they were.  
for my presence should not shadow their being.  

I do not know  
how to come out of silence  
for words have been poisoned  
the mouths that once chanted mantras  
now ooze out blood.  

I was told  
I had the spells to heal the world.  
this must be another world.  
for people here play in blood.
