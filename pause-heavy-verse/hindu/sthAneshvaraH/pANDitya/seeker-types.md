## What can the world learn from Bharata
In one of my conversations in India, I told my students, the world can learn from Bharata just two concepts of sacrifice (tyāga) and asceticism (tapasyā). First of all, both the words are not properly translated in this English rendering. But you got the idea.

My Guruji Khaptad Baba used to say, there are two types of seekers: the pig types and the swan types. The pig types only search for the dirt and the swan types only search for the good. And of course the average world is the same no matter where you go and no matter who you talk with.

To be a researcher, you have to train your eyes to look beneath what is apparent. If all you can see is the pile of dirt as you land to Delhi airport, you do not have what it takes to be a researcher.

The two words sum up my experience of India in this trip. Look for the number of people willing to give up their personal interest, their immediate gains, their personal needs and convictions, in order to accommodate the other. Look for the comfort the subjects are willing to sacrifice to give space for the other. And this is where you encounter the first concept of sacrifice, of tyāga.

Try walking barefoot alongside the Ayyappa devotees or Murugan devotees under the scorching sun. Or try fasting for a day in each temple visit or dietary regulations no matter where you go. Of course you can find those who are constantly seeking comfort. But I am talking about those who are quite able to, but are always enjoying commodities less than they can, always suspending life at the zone of comfort and not luxury even when they can. And this is where you encounter tapas.

The concepts of tyāga and tapasyā are the concepts of asceticism and that of social philosophy. This is not the philosophy of socialism or capitalism. This comes when your heart is filled with humanism.


## Students Old times and New Times
Old Times:  
Guruji, can you accept me as your student?  
What are your prerequisites for me to be your student?  
Do you think I can achieve self-recognition in this lifetime? How many life-times would I need to do sadhana, guruji?

## New Times
Guruji, were can I find your biodata?  
Do you think you can liberate me?  
Can I take a selfie with you?

## Can I ask
Some ask me: how are you doing? I say fine, and they say: can I ask you a question?  
And other times, they simply send me a message: can I ask you a question? And I say yes.  
This way, I never have to write one extra word but have already answered their question.
