Conference  

They were out there,  
In a humid Weimar summer,  
Catching a breath,  
In between conference panels.  

She had a stash but he was out,  
They shared the smoke and laughed,  
And they loved and kissed,  
And made a vow,  
Of every moment,  
And in between,  
To not ever be apart,  
When the cigarette was gone,  
And the break was over,  
They left to not see each other again.+++(4)+++
