title = "Ripples of thought"
+++

Formed as shadows,  
Part unfinished,  
Crawl around and complain,  
Eager like children running around,  
The world is not a place for the speech to unfold.  

In the speech I offer myself,  
Vac,  
the pristine expression of being as such,  
Not as me and you but both me and you.

The song I have cannot be sung,  
As I am one with the song,  
And when I come out the song is gone.+++(5)+++
