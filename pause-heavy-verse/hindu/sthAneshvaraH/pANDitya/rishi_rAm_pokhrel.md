Today the memory of professor Rishi Ram Pokhrel is resurfacing since early morning.  
I am not connected with him in any social media  
but if any of you are in contact with him, please convey my regards.  
Particularly coming vivid today is an incident that changed my life forever. 

When I was an undergraduate student, professor Pokhrel was the college principal.  
One evening when I was heading out of campus, the college guard stopped me and said,  
professor Pokhrel is calling you at his office.  
That simply meant something not good.
I was scared entering his office.  
And I could see in his face he was really upset.  
And he screamed, 'why did you not fill out the form?'  
Actually, that day was the last day to fill out the form for the final exams.  
I started shaking and soon started crying. 

With my broken words, I said, I have no money to fill out the form.  
Then professor Pokhrel showed me the list of registration and my name was already there.  
He said, I have filled out the form for you and now do not embarrass me.  
I could not even say thank you and my vision was blurred with tears.  
I came on top of the entire university that year and was awarded King Virendra scholarship for my graduate studies.
