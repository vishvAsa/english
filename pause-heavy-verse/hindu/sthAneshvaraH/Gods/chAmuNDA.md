Ma Camunda!  
Why torment this heart,  
As you own all its beats,  
And ask me,  
The secrecy of mudrā,  
The complexity of maṇḍala,  
The rhythms of mantra.

Why speak through me,  
As you can enlighten all hearts.

Let this speck of dust,  
Stuck somewhere in thy feet,  
Be free of this world,  
For the darkness has gone too long,  
And the fire has been stolen,  
Let me see thy face,  
And let me die in you again.
