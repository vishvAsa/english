Altar Bird  

O fire of time,  
Incinerate this body,  
From toe to head,  
And let ambrosia flow,  
Soaking the ashes,  
Rejuvenating it,  
And let me fly with new wings,  
For I am the altar bird.  

O time-eater,  
I have seen you at the edge,  
Of being and non-being,  
Always empty and full.+++(5)+++  

For long ago,  
I have lost passion for both,  
To be and not to be,  
For I am the altar bird.
