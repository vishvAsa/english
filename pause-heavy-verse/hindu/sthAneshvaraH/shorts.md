## Kali
Oh Kali, you fell prey of your own slumber,
And left me afloat in the tides of samsara.

## mountains
When the mountains summon, you listen to them.
The soul must be dead within, if they don't talk to you.

both cannot read the first line in plural.  
the first is at the verge of erasing himself,  
the second is at the verge of erasing the humanity.
