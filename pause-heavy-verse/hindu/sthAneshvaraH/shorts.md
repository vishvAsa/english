## Kali
Oh Kali, you fell prey of your own slumber,
And left me afloat in the tides of samsara.

## mountains
When the mountains summon, you listen to them.
The soul must be dead within, if they don't talk to you.


## Society
### Solipsists and Narcissists
solipsists and narcissists,  
both cannot read the first line in plural.  
the first is at the verge of erasing himself,  
the second is at the verge of erasing the humanity.

### Reception
When Siddhartha left his palace, he was not embarking the network of million franchises. When the giant elephants stroll through the forest, they give birthplace to million dung-beetles. The nature of a banyan tree is to grow tall. For some, it is a lovely shade or a nesting ground. For others, it is just a bunch of firewood.

Your being here is a blessing. How the blessing is received is not for you to decide.
