title = "Fields of Thopal"

Some childhood memories latch on  
Adhered to the body  
Imprinted on the soul  

Chasing after the kites  
Rolling down the fields  
Soaring alongside paper planes  
Jumping in the brisk waters of Thopal  

It feels as if the red dust from the slopes  
still clings to my skin  
The nameless shadows  
The faceless memories  
The childrenâ€™s shrills of excitement  

Remembering all the wild berries  
Amla, Amaro, and Tindu fruits  
Now feeling as though this life is but a shadow  
Of a life already lived+++(5)+++  
An apparition of something gone  
Leaving only memories in its wake
