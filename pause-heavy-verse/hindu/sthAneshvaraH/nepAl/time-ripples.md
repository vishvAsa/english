In the dry air of San Diego,  
And the bright sunlight,  
On top of Iron Mountain,  
In the songs of mockingbirds.  

I smell humidity today,  
With storms gathered around,  
Tall shadows of snowy peaks,  
Reflecting the cuckoo songs.

The banks of Kali summon me again,  
The footsteps left behind even before I knew shame,  
Like a kite anchored away,  
Magnetic force pulls me again.

Far gone are the childhood friends,  
And dust and noise have consumed the land,  
Chasing upon my own shadows,  
I must but run before the sun goes down.
