title = "Despotism rise"
+++

My father used to say, you value what you earn and not what you inherit. I realize its depth as days go by and as I witness the rise of despotism. If my generation fought for democracy, the new generation is fighting to reinstall dictatorship. And they say, it is for the better.

I remember being arrested one dark night alongside some hundred colleagues.  
I was fortunate to have been released after 18 hours of interrogation  
but not all my friends were lucky.  
Someone had informed the police that the students had some pamphlets against the king.  
Even though there was nothing to find,  
the investigation was severe.  
Some of my friends were not that lucky.  
Some were electrocuted while peeing.  
Some were inserted pins through their nails.  
And others were jailed for six months or a year. For absolutely no reason - In suspicion that they could have been against the monarch.  
Basu, my room mate, had the stamp of boot on his chest and he was bleeding through his ears.  
And they say, the king was peaceful.

It was not the agents working under the direction of the embassies  
that abolished our traditional education system.  
It was not the corrupt leaders who displaced all our temple management  
and abolished the guthi system that maintained our temples.  
It was the Hindu king that some think can be reinstated to power again.

I do not believe the revolution was a mistake - May be because it was ours.  
I only know the people did not understand the word freedom, its meaning and its implication.  
I remember the next day after democracy  
how the crowd was gambling on the streets,  
claiming they also have freedom.  
We are unable to fathom freedom.  
We have elected mass-murderers  
and some of the most corrupt people in the world in the name of democracy.  
I have lost my faith and respect as it comes to the public.  
If you repeatedly elect a mass-murderer,  
you need to know that you do not deserve respect.  

But I have not lost my senses to unearth the rotten bodies of the children of Micha Khan  
and believe that I can revive them.  
It just shows the depravity of rationality when I witness what the crowd is trying to achieve.
