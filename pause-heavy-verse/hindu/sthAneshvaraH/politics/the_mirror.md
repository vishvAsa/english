the mirror  

the mirror had to go,  
for the stories it came with,  
that it was a haunting mirror,  
in a topsy turvy mirror world,  
a clown+++(â†’ Trump)+++ believing himself an emperor,  
they all wanted to hang the mirror,  
some to admire and others, to punish.  

but the pietists,  
broke the mirror being outraged,  
in the dark of a night,  
for they all were embarrassed,  
to see their face in the mirror.  

before the mirror,  
they were all beautiful,  
and once the mirror was gone,  
they all were beautiful again.
