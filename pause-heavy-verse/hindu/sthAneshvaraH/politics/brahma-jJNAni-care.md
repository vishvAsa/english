## महा-सिद्ध-धर्मः
you had another question, if Mahasiddhas like Khaptad Baba +++(who was from kAshmIr)+++ were concerned about Kashmir issues.  
My answer is, NO. As far as I can tell, they were not at all concerned about those issues.  
How do I know that?  
I was young then, and every social issue used to bug me; conversion by the missionaries in particular.  
And I had raised these issues then with them. And they never paid attention. And I was annoyed, thinking, "what the shit is this baba worth if he does not give a damn about our big problems."

And I became old. I do not want you to become old like me. And in my old age, I started thinking differently. And I am not asking you to think differently. All I am doing is saying about my own perception. For in my old age, I understood Hindu dharma differently.

For me, the dharma of a Mahasiddha and Brahmajnani is different. He is above karma. He is jnanamurti. He is a living example of the Brahman. And there comes the Brahma. Brahma also does not care about day to day business, meaning, going and fixing.

But he cares enough to change the dynasties and go and kill the kings when the kings do not do their rightful duty. Parashurama comes to my mind. Pushyamitra ~~Agnimitra~~ comes to my mind.

And ours is not a business to go and rule. And it is the role of the Kshatra to rule. And to rule means also to kill those who disturb the social order.

In today's India, Kshatra teaches shastras; Kshatra teaches how to love and be peaceful. Brahma and the rest of the society boils with rage.  
Democracy requires social tension, the only way to get elected is by making people blindly follow some leaders. Leaders never solve our problems. Because that would be suicidal for them. When the problems are solved, the leaders are not needed for that problem.

I have realized that Hinduism is not Islam. In Islam, everybody fights. In Hinduism, only Kshatriyas fight. In today's India, there are no Kshatriyas. These are my perceptions that I do not even know has any value for the world.

## Diaspora
About India, the Indians who really believe in fighting are the ones who stay in America, make a lot of money, enjoy American life, and preach about how they need to love India and fight against Pakis.  
Almost everybody I have met in America believes in fighting.  
Why? It is because it is in their mind and they do not have to do anything other than talking.  
They are making money, their children are American, and their only way to be connected to India is by talking against Pakistan.
