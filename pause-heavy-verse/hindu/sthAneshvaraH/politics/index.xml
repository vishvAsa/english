      <description>&lt;p&gt;I was told not to walk on grass,&lt;br&gt;&#xA;or move rocks,&lt;br&gt;&#xA;for they also had the right to be the way they were.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;for my presence should not shadow their being.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;I do not know,&lt;br&gt;&#xA;how to come out of silence,&lt;br&gt;&#xA;for words have &lt;del&gt;been&lt;/del&gt; poisoned the mouths that once chanted mantras.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;I was told,&lt;br&gt;&#xA;I had the spells to heal the world.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;this must be another world.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;for people here play in blood.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;मह-सदध-धरम&#34;&gt;महा-सिद्ध-धर्मः&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;you had another question, if Mahasiddhas like Khaptad Baba +++(who was from kAshmIr)+++ were concerned about Kashmir issues.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;My answer is, NO. As far as I can tell, they were not at all concerned about those issues.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;details&gt;&lt;summary&gt;विचार-परिवर्तनम्&lt;/summary&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;मतपरिवर्तने पृष्टो स स्थानेश्वरायावदन् ननु - &amp;ldquo;तेषाम् बुभुक्षां न तर्पयितुं शक्नोमी&amp;quot;ति?&#xA;तेन (तल्लेखेषु क्वचिद् उल्लेखेन च) ममायम् ऊहः - तस्यापि विकल्पेषु तादृशे विषये दुःखम् अवर्ततैव।&#xA;किञ्च, कालस्य गतिम्, आत्मनो वयः, स्थितिं, शक्तिं च ज्ञात्वा, नोद्विजते स्म,&lt;br&gt;&#xA;अपि त्व् असाधारणेन समाधानेन वर्तते स्म।&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Despotism rise</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;My father used to say, you value what you earn and not what you inherit. I realize its depth as days go by and as I witness the rise of despotism. If my generation fought for democracy, the new generation is fighting to reinstall dictatorship. And they say, it is for the better.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I remember being arrested one dark night alongside some hundred colleagues.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;I was fortunate to have been released after 18 hours of interrogation&lt;br&gt;&#xA;but not all my friends were lucky.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Someone had informed the police that the students had some pamphlets against the king.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Even though there was nothing to find,&lt;br&gt;&#xA;the investigation was severe.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Some of my friends were not that lucky.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Some were electrocuted while peeing.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Some were inserted pins through their nails.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;And others were jailed for six months or a year. For absolutely no reason - In suspicion that they could have been against the monarch.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Basu, my room mate, had the stamp of boot on his chest and he was bleeding through his ears.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;And they say, the king was peaceful.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Great again</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I feel immobile,&lt;br&gt;&#xA;And empty of words,&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Witnessing the ways blood is spilled,&lt;br&gt;&#xA;In the streets to make dystopia great again.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Going back to Shastras,&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Wanting to make sense of the events,&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Make me thoughtless,&lt;br&gt;&#xA;As there is nothing on earth,&lt;br&gt;&#xA;To make Buchenwald+++(=A nAzi camp)+++ great again.+++(5)+++&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This has been like watching,&lt;br&gt;&#xA;The Mount Everest collapse,&lt;br&gt;&#xA;And all the mountains, to make a gopher hill tall again.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;I marched in the streets when sixteen,&lt;br&gt;&#xA;And now watch with disbelief,&lt;br&gt;&#xA;The models were hollow from within,+++(5)+++&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Eaten by the termites of race,&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Wanting to make Mussolini great again.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Leaders come and go,&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Prophets come and go,&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Even God incarnates again and again,&lt;br&gt;&#xA;It is the humanity that I am worried about.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Seasons change as the Fall or the Spring,&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Youth is not granted forever and ever,&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Those drunken with grief or ecstasy,&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Shall not compromise decency forever.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I naively strolled out of my university hostel,&lt;br&gt;&#xA;And landed in a historic museum behind the forest,&lt;br&gt;&#xA;And entered with curiosity, waiting in line,&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Not knowing, I had entered Buchenwald concentration camp.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;My tears are not so cheap&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There is no counting of the times I have cried - Sometimes even not knowing why.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;I remember crying, actually following my sister,&lt;br&gt;&#xA;when the doctor gave up on my mother.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;My father asked why was I crying and since I did not know,&lt;br&gt;&#xA;I looked at my sister.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Mother survived but I never forgot the scene.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I remember some drops falling when I was with my friends offering flowers to BP Koirala.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;I was not educated enough to understand why this person was important.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;May be I cried because that was the first time I had come across a dead body.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;the mirror&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;the mirror had to go,&lt;br&gt;&#xA;for the stories it came with,&lt;br&gt;&#xA;that it was a haunting mirror,&lt;br&gt;&#xA;in a topsy turvy mirror world,&lt;br&gt;&#xA;a clown+++(→ Trump)+++ believing himself an emperor,&lt;br&gt;&#xA;they all wanted to hang the mirror,&lt;br&gt;&#xA;some to admire and others, to punish.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;but the pietists,&lt;br&gt;&#xA;broke the mirror being outraged,&lt;br&gt;&#xA;in the dark of a night,&lt;br&gt;&#xA;for they all were embarrassed,&lt;br&gt;&#xA;to see their face in the mirror.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
