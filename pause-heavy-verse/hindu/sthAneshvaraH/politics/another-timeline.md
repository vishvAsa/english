I was told not to walk on grass,  
or move rocks,  
for they also had the right to be the way they were.

for my presence should not shadow their being.  
I do not know,  
how to come out of silence,  
for words have ~~been~~ poisoned the mouths that once chanted mantras.  
I was told,  
I had the spells to heal the world.  
this must be another world.  
for people here play in blood.
