Lonely Palm  

Every dawn and dusk,  
He greets with shadow and light,  
This lonely palm,  
A sole witness of my days,  
My being intertwined with his.  

Some crows nested last year,  
Doves hatched their nestlings this year,  
The palm just is,  
Indifferent,+++(5)+++  
Lonely is the concept he lacks,+++(5)+++  
Happy in the slumber of pure being.
