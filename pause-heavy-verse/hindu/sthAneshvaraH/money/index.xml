      <description>&lt;p&gt;Let me tell you a story. One fine day, I was gossiping, strolling with one of the richest friends I ever had. Going to the opposite direction on the other side was a homeless couple, with their bags hanging on shoulder. My friend suddenly started laughing. When I asked what is the matter? she pointed to the other direction and said, &amp;lsquo;how cute, a hobo couple.&amp;rsquo;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Very few among you know that I was on the street at one point in my life. I realized that day that no matter how much you read or how much you meditate, as long as you are not out for real seva, real service, you are not cultivating your heart. Right at that moment, I decided that if I ever were to have my own school, I will make service a primary element.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I am in mood today to share you some stories that I have never shared with anybody. It was around 1989. I was back to Kathmandu that time and my guruji [Prem Chetan] insisted that I perform the ritual of life-installation for one temple. I was actually commissioned by Aishwarya Shaha, the Queen of Nepal. And for the days long life-installation prāṇa-pratiṣṭhā ritual ( Krishna temple in Bhimsengola, Purano Baneshwar), the queen gave me six rupees [about a dime] for dakṣiṇā. I do not know how many of you have felt vanity this close.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
