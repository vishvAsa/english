title = "Hobo-couple"
+++

Let me tell you a story. One fine day, I was gossiping, strolling with one of the richest friends I ever had. Going to the opposite direction on the other side was a homeless couple, with their bags hanging on shoulder. My friend suddenly started laughing. When I asked what is the matter? she pointed to the other direction and said, 'how cute, a hobo couple.' 

Very few among you know that I was on the street at one point in my life. I realized that day that no matter how much you read or how much you meditate, as long as you are not out for real seva, real service, you are not cultivating your heart. Right at that moment, I decided that if I ever were to have my own school, I will make service a primary element.

> real seva?

anything you do without expecting something in return.  
but cultivated seva has to come from some others.  
+++(In real seva -)+++ you cannot say, "since i like serving this way I will do this instead." because you are exploiting your likings and your choices. that still is not true seva.
