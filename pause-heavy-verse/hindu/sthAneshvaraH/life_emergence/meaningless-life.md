Meaningful Life

I do not know when,  
I found meaning to life,  
And gave meaning to pointless things,  
Forgetting all meanings were self-imposed.  

And stopped fluttering like a butterfly,  
In the garden of paradise,  
And dragged the cart of success,   
And made myself a meaningful ox,  
I long for those meaningless days,  
Those pointless laughters,  
And a few drops of tears,  
Not to make any point,  
But just to live again,  
A meaningless life.
