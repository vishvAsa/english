all dreams come to an end,  
on the crack of the shell,  
on the first opening,  
the first sound,  
as darkness vanished and light flooded,  
I was both inside and outside the egg,  
my feet inside and head outside,  
touching the beauty of the first dawn,  

I lingered with nostalgia,  
with anxieties and pangs of emotions,  
watching the vanishing shadows,  
of those who tormented me in the dark,  
ready for the first flight,   
into the unknown,  
I find this more comforting than the mother's womb,  
to walk out of the known dark,  
into the dazzling light and unfathomable blue sky.
