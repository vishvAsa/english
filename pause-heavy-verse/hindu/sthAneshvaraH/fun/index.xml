      <description>&lt;p&gt;A One Time Chef&#xA;It is hard to stop laughing when we remember pieces of our college life. I just woke up laughing this morning, recollecting one incident when I was deemed the best chef.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The thing is, Martin Luther in Halle those days did not have that many deshi students.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;The student body organized a food-fest and there were students from so many countries participating,&lt;br&gt;&#xA;but nobody from Nepal, not even from India.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;And my colleagues said, you have to show your skills.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;For me, there is nothing funny than to imagine myself as a chef.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Cooking is not like flying a jet.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Making a good dish requires ten times the passion.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;There is no auto-pilot as it comes to seasoning or mixing flavors and creating a new flavor.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
