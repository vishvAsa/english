The last resonance,  
The last echo,  
I only got a glimpse of some shadows,  
A minute before the sunset,  
A moment before emptiness.

Some sweet memories erupt,  
Mixed with some tears,  
Before all forms vanish,  
I envisage,  
And savor the last bits of echos,  
Relish the last glimpse shadows.

I ask time,  
To freeze for me for a bit,  
I ask the sun,  
To slow down for a bit,  
All in vain,  
All I caught were some shadows.

The music I guess was vibrant,  
For the echo has its magnet,  
The form must be dazzling,  
As the shadows overpower me.

As if paralyzed,  
Watching time to flow,  
The laughter of Kali,  
A flash of lightening,  
The gift of life,  
Before all calms to oblivion.
