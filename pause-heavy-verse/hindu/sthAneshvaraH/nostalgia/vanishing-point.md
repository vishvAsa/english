Vanishing point  
Family and friends,  
Colleagues and acquaintances,  
Do you ever feel?  
There is a vanishing point,  

Where the real characters,  
Appear as familiar as the movie characters,  

Like a comet tail,  
Starting from the pole of the heart,  
To the pitch dark oblivion,+++(5)+++  

As if from the brilliance of sunlight,  
To the night of the new moon,  
My throbbing heart seeks rest,  
Not in light but in the new moon,  

This vanishing point of darkness,  
In this return to the womb,+++(5)+++  
Seeks home again,  
In the hue of darkness,  
Filled with undivided love.
