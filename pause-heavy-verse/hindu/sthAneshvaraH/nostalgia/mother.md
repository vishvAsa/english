You Gave me the being of first pulsation  
And from the dark of nothingness,  
Brought me to the light of being.

You as the ripples of ah and m,  
Gave first beats to the tiny heart,  
And thus gave body to the being that was not there before.  

You Shared your first breath,  
And breathed through the tiny lungs,  
Giving its first rhythms.

I live a borrowed being,  
Now both as being and absence,  
Anticipating that the eyes that I see through,  
are your eyes to see the world.
