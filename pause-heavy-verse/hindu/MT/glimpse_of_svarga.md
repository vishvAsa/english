Sometimes a man goes to place so much better than where he stays or usually operates  
that he gets a glimpse of the belief in the existence of higher loka-s or svarga-s.  
As he wanders around that place,  
he witnesses an abundance of things that so rare in his own  
and has an intensity of experience much stronger than in his own.  
Most denizens of that place have their own higher lives  
that they don't even notice the interloper.  
While he can experience the place as a beholder,  
as an outsider he cannot really participate in it  
because he lacks the qualifications to be a participant.  

Finally, a lesser denizen of the said svarga might notice visitor  
and take him around and introduce him to the ways of the svarga.  
On one hand he sees really how much grander it is than his own place.  
But on the other he learns from his guide  
that it is repeatedly threatened by vR^itra-s, rauhiNa, shuShNa and the like.  
During those times its happy denizens too face many terrors,  
but it is the gods who defend those realms with much vigilance and tricks (upAya-s).  
They stand even loftier than the ordinary denizens of the said svarga. 

The interloper might in course of the above peregrination with his guide or on his own meet with such a deva.  
The deva is the master of a vast legion of gaNa-s across many realms  
so he can only offer a brief audience to the typical wanderer if at all.  
However, when he gets that he has profound experience.  
But before he knows it, he returns to his more ordinary place and troubled waters.  
It may set in him a profound yearning for the suvarga but usually that remains unattainable. 

Conversely, he might have a visitor in his ordinary place from the vastly superior place.  
That arouses in him the belief that someday he might encounter a god in his ordinary place and have a higher experience.
