      <description>&lt;p&gt;I knew a shitty kid like this at school in the 70s (there were many shit kids, most turned out ok), he was violent with it. When he left school he joined the army. Fought for the country. The army channelled his aggression and gave him discipline.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I knew a couple kids who were psychologically unhinged, they were in the lowest stream at school. At my 1500 pupil London comprehensive school 20% of the kids were in the &amp;lsquo;C&amp;rsquo; stream (almost exclusively boys). This stream was for low achievers, the less intelligent kids. Some were bullies, trouble-makers, disruptive - others were passive and silent like Forest Gump. The teachers didn&amp;rsquo;t bother teaching them so they were given films to watch, and did low-level crap work for the school day.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
