I knew a shitty kid like this at school in the 70s (there were many shit kids, most turned out ok), he was violent with it. When he left school he joined the army. Fought for the country. The army channelled his aggression and gave him discipline.

I knew a couple kids who were psychologically unhinged, they were in the lowest stream at school. At my 1500 pupil London comprehensive school 20% of the kids were in the 'C' stream (almost exclusively boys). This stream was for low achievers, the less intelligent kids. Some were bullies, trouble-makers, disruptive - others were passive and silent like Forest Gump. The teachers didn't bother teaching them so they were given films to watch, and did low-level crap work for the school day.

Anyway, the 2 unhinged kids were impossible to control, hyperactive, 'conversation' driven with expletives, cruel to kids, setting fire to things. These 2 kids left school before exams and both ended up in prison.

Many of the C stream kids became builders, mechanics, plumbers and tradespeople - ended up ok.

I knew a notorious Irish family; my older sister was girlfriend to the older boy, he was said to be the toughest kid in the area. He started drinking at the pub when he was 14. He died in his 40s from booze.  I was friends with the middle and the younger boys. The middle boy went to prison for stabbing someone after leaving school; when he got out he calmed down and found work. The oldest sister got into drugs after leaving school and died young after someone kicked her in the head when she was begging outside a london underground station. The younger sister had a kid young, she got into drugs. She overdosed in her late twenties, went to hospital and died of a lung infection.

Their father was an alcoholic, a builder. I remember he had no teeth, they had rotted away. He had a heart attack in his 50s.

Back to the younger boy, Michael. He was rough and tough. We became friends. When I first went round their house I realised there was no set meal times. The kids would come in, make themselves something to eat, then go back out. This while their mum was sitting on the sofa smoking. All of the family were chain smokers apart from Michael.

When Michael left school he worked on a building site. A few years later he started his own building company, he developed houses, opened a wine bar, made tons of money. He bought a place in the Caribbean and moved there permanently. He was the white sheep of a 'black' family.

There are a bazillion anecdotes I have about the kids I knew. Life is wonderful, tragic, and complex.
