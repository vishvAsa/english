A verse by Crazy Shagdar, a wandering Mongol vajrayAnist who went around satirizing high folks. On meeting a lama with a tAntrika partner.

I don't want a blessing to be rich like Vaisravana. I 
don't want a blessing to be bold like  
the tigers and panthers.  
I want to be like the married lamas.  
I want a blessing to have a woman around the place, like you.
