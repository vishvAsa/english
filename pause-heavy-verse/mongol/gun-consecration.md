My gun, blessed by Manjuśrī and Yamāntaka:  
Its body is like the body of the lion.  
Its voice is like the voice of the dragon.  
Its medicine is like the medicine of Manjushri.  
Its shot is like the stars of the firmament.  
Its cock is like the claws of the Garuda-bird.c  
Its fire is like the lightning of the naga-s.  
Its ramrod is like the medicine of the doctor  
Which removes impurities.  
Its stock is like the blessed strong lion  
Which rounds up and seizes all the beasts.  
Manjuśrī and Yamantaka,  
Deign to bless My truly powerful gun.
