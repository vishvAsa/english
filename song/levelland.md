Flatter than a table top  
Makes you wonder why they stopped here  
Wagon must have lost a wheel  
Or they lacked ambition one

In the great migration west  
Separated from the rest  
Though they might have tried their best  
They never caught the sun

So they sunk some roots down in this dirt 
To keep from blowin' off the earth  
Built a town right here  
When the dust had all but cleared

They called it Levelland  
Levelland  
Levelland

Grand dad grew the dry land wheat  
Stood on his own two feet  
His mind got incomplete  
And they put him in a home+++(4)+++

Daddy's cotton grows so high  
Sucks the water table dry  
His rolling sprinklers circle back  
Bleeding it to the bone+++(4)+++

And I won't be here when it comes the day   
It all dries up and blows away  
I'd hang around just to see  
But they never had much use for me

In Levelland  
They don't understand me  
In Levelland

Well I watch those ships trails comin' out that big blue sky  
Coast to coasters, watch 'em go  
And I don't blame 'em one damn bit  
If they never look down on this  
Ain't much down here they'd want to know 

Just Levelland  
You could wash your hands  
In nothin' but Levelland  

Mama used to roll her hair  
Back before the central air  
We'd sit outside and watch the stars at night  
She tell me to make a wish  
I'd wish we both could fly  
I don't think she's seen the sky  
Since we got the satellite dish+++(5)+++

I can hear the marching band  
Doing the best they can to play  
Smoke on the water  
And joy to the world

I payed up all my debts  
Got some change left over yet  
I'm getting on a whisper jet  
Going to fly as far as I can get+++(4)+++  

From Levelland  
Done the best I can  
In Levelland
