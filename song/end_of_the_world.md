## Lyrics

Why does the sun go on shining?  
Why does the sea rush to shore?  
Don't they know it's the end of the world?  
'Cause you don't love me any more…

Why does the sun go on shining?  
Why does the sea rush to shore?  
Don't they know it's the end of the world?  
'Cause you don't love me any more

Why do the birds go on singing?  
Why do the stars glow above?  
Don't they know it's the end of the world?  
It ended when I lost your love

I wake-up in the morning, and I wonder  
Why everything's the same as it was  
I can't understand, no, I can't understand  
How life goes on the way it does

Why does my heart go on beating?  
Why do these eyes of mine cry?  
Don't they know it's the end of the world?  
It ended when you said, "Good-bye"

Mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm  
(Why do these eyes of mine cry?)  
Mmm, mmm, mmm  
Don't they know it's the end of the world?  
It ended when you said, "Good-bye"
