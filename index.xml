      <description>&lt;p&gt;Source: &lt;a href=&#34;https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2024/04/21/the-visitation-on-the-knoll/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The visitation on the knoll&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It was the time Somakhya and Indrasena were by themselves — without their companions — for that is close to the ultimate test of a man. At that point, they were working on the mysterious three-gene system coding for an ATPase that had evolved from a GTPase, a mystery protein, and a RNase. While they had made an initial incision they were being rebuffed by it and it was testing Indrasena’s skills to the utmost. To clear their minds, they decided to go out for a walk in the solitude among the knolls. Just before Indrasena could join Somakhya, he got a call regarding an emergency in the lab and he had to head there to inspect the situation. Somakhya nevertheless decided to continue alone for, after all, the final reckoning of a man comes when he is all by himself. Thus, he walked the gently rising paths against the backdrop of the mild spring sun — the benign symbol in the intermediate heavens of the great god Savitṛ whose laws none violate. The following incantation came to his mind: “adābhyo bhuvanāni pracākaśad vratāni devaḥ savitābhi rakṣate ।”&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Source: &lt;a href=&#34;https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2024/03/10/the-crossover-with-dabba-se%e1%b9%ad%e1%b9%adhiputta/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The crossover with Dabba Seṭṭhīputta&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;ash&#34;&gt;Ash&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It was a Śivarātrī. Vidrum accompanied his friends Somakhya and Lootika to visit the small shrine of Rudra in the cemetery beside his house. It was one of the rare days when the normally deserted cemetery was fairly busy with many a votary streaming in to pay homage at the shrine. Vidrum milled around a bit as his friends performed some japa at the side of the circumambulatory circuit of the shrine. There were vendors of flowers and bilva leaves whose wares the votaries bought to offer to The god (sa devaḥ). A pleasant breeze blew through the cemetery, making howling noises reminiscent of ghosts and also reminding the cognizant votary of the presence of the The god of the Vrātya-s who “blows here”. As if to bring back that picture from a bygone Aryan age, a tall śaiva ascetic suddenly strode into the shrine. He carried a trident, a large pair of iron tongs slung from his shoulder, and was beating a ḍamaru as he cycled through the recitation of the pañcabrahma-mantra-s. He sat down at one corner and started singing a stotra attributed to the demon-king of Laṅkā. Seeing him, Vidrum came back and sat beside his friends. The śaiva ascetic then arose again and started making circumambulations, resuming the muttering of brahma-mantra-s. As reached the Bahurūpī-ṛk, the ascetic suddenly darted towards Somakhya and smeared ashes on his forehead. As he continued with his circumambulation, at one point, when he was reciting the Vāmadeva-ṛk, he did the same to Lootika. He then went inside the garbhagṛha and started muttering some mantra-s. While he was uttering them in a low tone that the lay devotees would make no sense of, Lootika realized what he was uttering and caught Somakhya’s eye. Somakhya, too, had simultaneously figured out his incantation and whispered to Lootika: “I’m surprised — it is the Mahākāla-hṛdaya, a rare mantra from the root of Śambhu-para Uttarāmnāya, known to very few!” L: “Indeed!”&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Source: &lt;a href=&#34;https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2024/01/16/the-dalal-who-became-a-poltergeist/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The Dalāl who became a poltergeist&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Lootika had returned from a scientific competition, which had been held in the dreadful city of Mahāvisphoṭaka, like the victorious Roman army after sacking the towns of West Asian counter-religionists. To both celebrate and to educate the class her teacher had organized an evening of sky-watching where Lootika was to introduce her often unruly classmates to the basics of astronomy. She knew well that beauty and success inspired anger and envy in many and that such a session could descend into the unsavory or worse quickly. Hence, she roped in Somakhya and convinced her teacher that he should take the lead in the session, though he had stayed out of the competition and let her claim the glory. She almost felt he had been like Zeus letting Herakles gain the glory at contests of the Olympic games. She faced her share of scowls and intentional interruptions from the more begrudging and rowdy classmates, but for the most part, it went well as Somakhya handled much of the show. Thus, after the session, they decided to take advantage of the situation and partake in the joys of dinner at a restaurant with some of their classmates — something their parents heavily disapproved of. For this purpose, they decided to meet at Vidrum’s house and then proceed to a nearby eating place. That way, Lootika could get back home in time without arousing any suspicions that might trigger her parents’ espionage regime.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Letting her sleep off the jet lag, they left for work. Given the good weather, Lootika returned early to check on their friend and go out with her prospecting spiders in the nearby woods for their work on endosymbionts. L: “Hope you had some good sleep and are all set to lead our battle-charge? Let me get you something to eat and we’ll head out when the sun goes down a bit. Somakhya and a student will join us in the woods.” Even as Lootika brought Irmhild some snacks, she said: “Restful, but strange. At least I can confess this to you without any embarrassment — After a while, I had a visitation from Lizzie — I’m sure you have heard of her from Somakhya and your folks. In any case, it may be a good sign given what we intend to do.” L: “Ah! they mentioned her in passing, but my recollection is they were not successful in getting her to say anything.” Ir: “I would not be so negative — I learned her name from that really exciting sitting they arranged.” L: “I’d like to hear it straight from your mouth — ain’t it interesting we never got to talk about that in length?”&lt;/p&gt;</description>

With the autumnal vacations,&#xA;Somakhya was having a good time with his visiting cousin, giving him&#xA;lectures on the theory and the practice of the study of variable stars.&#xA;During the day, they spent their time with numerical solutions of&#xA;differential equations that modeled the pulsations of stars. At night,&#xA;they observed the stars in good view from Somakhya’s terrace with the&#xA;smog of the fireworks having lifted. Additionally, as instructed by&#xA;Somakhya’s father, he was also teaching Yashashravas sections of the&#xA;hautra mantra-pāṭha. The on the second day of his cousin’s visit, the&#xA;two of them were doing their evening saṃdhyā rituals together when&#xA;Somakhya was disturbed by a peculiar behavior evinced by his cousin. In&#xA;the midst of his prāṇāyāma or arghya, Yashashravas suddenly uttered the&#xA;word Āpastamba-sūtra almost randomly a few times with a peculiar&#xA;affectation and cadence. Somakhya was taken aback, but remembering his&#xA;father’s words of never getting disturbed in his performance, he ignored&#xA;it and continued to the end. Somakhya: “Yashashravas, what is wrong with&#xA;you — have you gone crazy? Why were you randomly saying&#xA;“Āpastamba-sūtra” in the course of your saṃdhyāvandana? I know you are&#xA;of that school, but it makes no sense to pepper your upāsana with&#xA;utterances of that word, moreover voiced in that strange manner.”&#xA;Yashashravas felt as if some weight had lifted off his head and told&#xA;Somakhya a strange tale. Somakhya was shocked by it, but once he had&#xA;gathered himself, he said they should wait until his friend Lootika&#xA;visited before taking any further action.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Source: &lt;a href=&#34;https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2005/12/18/the-sub-continental-stirrings/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We had earlier commented how the Trojan horse, whom we used to call Chappal (slipper) in our days of youth was working his wonders with the Indian army. We had speculated that he was specifically an agent of the roguish pirate chief Ponting to do away with his main dangers before the invasion of the subcontinent. We have now got some intelligence as to how the Indian ants invited the parasitoid wasp Greg “Chappal” into their nest. The lazy king of Vanga, seeing his Kiwi mercenary returning to his own country, decided to get Chappal thinking he was an ally of his. A little did he know of the mission Ponting had primed Chappal for. In the mean time with the actual battle performance of the Vanga champion being less than desirable, and the veteran Prince of Bombay being side-lined due to the blows he had received from cannon shards in the thick of battle, the prince of the Karnata country decided to stage a coup de tat with his supporters. Pulling around him a bunch of adventurers such as the Bundela, the Mohammedan Kaif, the viShama Gambhira and others he got over the Trojan plant Chappal to his side. Then he used Chappal to seize the throne by ousting the Vanga warrior and also trying to threaten the Vanga’s supporters like the Sikh turbanator and the Andhra chieftain from Vangipura. As result the whole Indian army has been stirred and the atmosphere of fear has been reinstated to possibly trigger a decline in performance.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

He quickly got into a conflict with the prince of Vanga and the brave Andhra grenadier from Vangipura. We believe that the Anglo-Saxon is a Trojan horse sent by the king of the Southern Whites to ruin the Hindu armies. We suspect that he might be a plant to spoil the Hindu performance by his policies of targeted disruption and deletion.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Slit-Eyes was succeeded by pirate Ponting, who was ably supported by the old guard of the Slit-Eyes empire, such as Gen. Hayden, bombardier McGrath, raider-in-chief Warnie, captains Langer and Gilchrist, Bishop Martyn and other saboteurs, Clarke, Gillespie and Lee. The Southern Saxons in the heydays of Slit-Eyes and Pirate Emperor Border, had engaged in many raiding operations on the Saxon mainland, and had fought many epic battle even as the pirates of the Caribbeans. Warnie in particular had enriched himself on most of these raids with rich harvests of women and jewels and in the process led the pirates to many victories against the Mainland Saxons. The great pirates now embarked on a new expedition to mainland Saxony with a large force of fusiliers and bombardiers on their well made vessels. The Mainland Saxons recalling their own pirate Francis Drake decided to launch themselves into a spirited defence of their land. In the recent past, in a move to restore the pristine Leukospheric composition of their army, they did away with their earstwhile leader, the wily but unsuccessful Sultan Nasser Husseyn. He was replaced by the phelgmatic King Vaughan, master of all Saxony. He was ably aided by pirate Flintoff, who was believed to be a successor of bootlegger Botham in the heydays of Mainland Saxony.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

After a while, the entertainers reported to the mahArAjAdiraja parama-bhaTTAraka of sthAneshwara stating that they were hard-pressed to find a suitable vidUShaka for the play. The rAja thought for a while and quipped: “I am pretty certain that our paNDita, shri bANa could as well be the vidUShaka. ” He summoned bANa and asked him to be the vidUShaka in his own play. bANa complained: “How can I be the vidUShaka? I have never acted before.” “All the better”; said the king. “I have decided that you shall be the vidUShaka yourself”. All bANa could do was to enjoy himself at his own expense.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

In one of the greatest battles of all times the princes of the Andhra and the Karnata country had destroyed the Saxon pride that had swelled in the great invasion of India in the year of 2001 under Emperor of all Saxony, Slit-Eyes+++(=nAsser Hussain?)+++. In the battle of Chennai the prince of Mumbai had put to sword the Southern Saxon army. Then there had been the African raids where the power of Saxony had demolished the Hindus in the final skirmish. That was followed by skirmishes in India where the Saxons had prevailed again.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Source: &lt;a href=&#34;https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2003/09/18/testosteroniya-stuti/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Males get to enjoy this wonderful steroid. The poets of the long past days may have called it loosener of kAma’s shara-s. It creates mathematical prowess where none existed previously and quickens activity like no other secretion. The mind starts conceiving what was previously unthinkable. It is on account of this that males get more violent, more innovative, and at times downright brilliant.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When it was not there I could not multiply two matrices,&lt;br&gt;&#xA;when it surged forth from its fount I saw the inverse of a matrix.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;When it flowed not, I saw in wonder my fellow farers being ruined by sujAtA,&lt;br&gt;&#xA;but when it filled the channels I conquered sujAtA and her handmaids.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;The Hamiltonian of H left me dazed: had it not coursed through my tubes the pretty orbitals I would have never seen.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;The alphas left me shuddering in terror, but due to its grace I drew them to my lair.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;They felt confidently triumphant in theirs, but then it had joined for me new wires which were not there.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Beefy they were, as I was lean, but I left them stewing in their own blood.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;May it keep us welling with might for long.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Source: &lt;a href=&#34;https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2003/08/13/charlottes-tale/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Charlotte narrated me a strange incidence as we were recuperating from a session in the wild observing local fungal genera. Normally I do not suffer such tales lightly, but on this occasion I found some strange connection with certain imprints from my own past, and accordingly listened to her in rapt attention. At that time Charlotte had just arrived from her native land and preceded me by an year to the big city where I was to later live. In its suburbs she rented the basement of the sprawling house of an elderly sullen gentleman who was trying to make some money to meet his ends me. It suited her graduate student’s salary fine, and despite the queerness of the man, she chose to hold out at that outpost.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Lad.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;my-mother-tara&#34;&gt;My Mother Tara&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Vimalananda, the subject of this book, designed the cover and dictated to the author the following regarding its symbolic meaning:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;“&lt;em&gt;Ghora&lt;/em&gt; is darkness, the darkness of ignorance. &lt;em&gt;Aghora&lt;/em&gt; means light, the absence of darkness. Under the Tree of Knowledge is an Aghori, a follower of the path of Aghora. He has gone beyond ignorance thanks to the Flame of Knowledge which billows from the funeral pyre. The funeral pyre is the ultimate reality, a continual reminder that everyone has to die. Knowledge of the ultimate reality of Death has taken the Aghori beyond the Eight Snares of Existence: lust, anger, greed, delusion, envy, shame, disgust and fear which bind all beings. The Aghori plays with a human skull, astonished by the uselessness of limited existence, knowing the whole world to be within him though he is not in the world. His spiritual practices have awakened within him the power of Kundalini, which takes the form of the goddess dancing on the funeral pyre: Smashan Tara. He is bewildered to think that all is within him, not external to him; that he sees it not with the physical eyes but with the sense of perception. The Flame of Knowledge is that which preserves life, the Eternal Flame, the Supreme Ego, the Motherhood of God which creates the whole Maya of the universe and thanks only to Whose grace the Aghori has become immortal.”&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Mencken 7&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Author’s Preface 37&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The Antichrist 41&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;INTRODUCTION&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Save for his raucous, rhapsodical autobiography, “Ecce Homo,” “The Antichrist” is the last thing that Nietzsche ever wrote, and so it may be accepted as a statement of some of his most salient ideas in their final form. Notes for it had been accumulating for years and it was to have constituted the first volume of his long-projected &lt;em&gt;magnum opus&lt;/em&gt;, “The Will to Power.” His full plan for this work, as originally drawn up, was as follows:&#xA;Vol. I. The Antichrist: an Attempt at a Criticism of Christianity.   Vol. II. The Free Spirit: a Criticism of Philosophy as a Nihilistic Movement.   Vol. III. The Immoralist: a Criticism of Morality, the Most Fatal Form of Ignorance.   Vol. IV. Dionysus: the Philosophy of Eternal Recurrence.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;The first sketches for “The Will to Power” were made in 1884, soon after the publication of the first three parts of “Thus Spake Zarathustra,” and thereafter, for four years, Nietzsche piled up notes. They were written at all the places he visited on his endless travels in search of health—at Nice, at Venice, at Sils-Maria in the Engadine (for long his favourite resort), at Cannobio, at Zürich, at Genoa, at Chur, at Leipzig. Several times his work was interrupted by other books, first by “Beyond Good and Evil,” then by “The Genealogy of Morals” (written in twenty days), then by his Wagner pamphlets. Almost as often he changed his plan. Once he decided to expand “The Will to Power” to ten volumes, with “An Attempt at a New Interpretation of the World” as a general sub-title. Again he adopted the sub-title of “An Interpretation of All That Happens.” Finally, he hit upon “An Attempt at a Transvaluation of All Values,” and went back to four volumes, though with a number of changes in their arrangement. In September, 1888, he began actual work upon the first volume, and before the end of the month it was completed. The Summer had been one of almost hysterical creative activity. Since the middle of June he had written two other small books, “The Case of Wagner” and “The Twilight of the Idols,” and before the end of the year he was destined to write “Ecce Homo.” Some time during December his health began to fail rapidly, and soon after the New Year he was helpless. Thereafter he wrote no more.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;author-intro&#34;&gt;Author intro&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;FRIEDRICH NIETZSCHE was born near Leipzig in 1844, the son of a Lutheran clergyman. He attended the famous Pforta School, then went to university at Bonn and at Leipzig, where he studied philology and read Schopenhauer. When he was only twenty-four he was appointed to the chair of classical philology at Basle University; he stayed there until his health forced him into retirement in 1879. While at Basle he made and broke his friendship with Wagner, participated as an ambulance orderly in the Franco-Prussian War, and published &lt;em&gt;The Birth of Tragedy&lt;/em&gt; (1872), &lt;em&gt;Untimely Meditations&lt;/em&gt; (1873–6) and the first two parts of &lt;em&gt;Human, All Too Human&lt;/em&gt; (1878–9). From 1880 until his final collapse in 1889, except for brief interludes, he divorced himself from everyday life and, supported by his university pension, he lived mainly in France, Italy and Switzerland. The third part of &lt;em&gt;Human, All Too Human&lt;/em&gt; appeared in 1880, followed by &lt;em&gt;The Dawn&lt;/em&gt; in 1881. &lt;em&gt;Thus Spoke Zarathustra&lt;/em&gt; was written between 1883 and 1885, and his last completed books were &lt;em&gt;Ecce Homo&lt;/em&gt;, an autobiography, and &lt;em&gt;Nietzsche contra Wagner&lt;/em&gt;. He became insane in 1889 and remained in a condition of mental and physical paralysis until his death in 1900.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;HOW ZARATHUSTRA CAME INTO BEING.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Zarathustra&amp;rdquo; is my brother’s most personal work; it is the history of his most individual experiences, of his friendships, ideals, raptures, bitterest disappointments and sorrows. Above it all, however, there soars, transfiguring it, the image of his greatest hopes and remotest aims. My brother had the figure of Zarathustra in his mind from his very earliest youth: he once told me that even as a child he had dreamt of him. At different periods in his life, he would call this haunter of his dreams by different names; &amp;ldquo;but in the end,&amp;rdquo; he declares in a note on the subject, &amp;ldquo;I had to do a PERSIAN the honour of identifying him with this creature of my fancy. Persians were the first to take a broad and comprehensive view of history. Every series of evolutions, according to them, was presided over by a prophet; and every prophet had his &amp;lsquo;Hazar,&amp;rsquo;—his dynasty of a thousand years.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Attack the stars instead of fearing them? A name like Ishmael?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Yes.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;My parents flew with the first brave ones to Mars. Turned less than brave, gone sick for Earth, they returned home. Conceived on that journey, I was born in space.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;My father knew his Bible and recalled another outcast who wandered dead seas long years before Christ.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;There was a desert prairie filled with wind and sun and sagebrush and a silence that grew sweetly up in wildflowers. There was a rail track laid across this silence and now the rail track shuddered.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Soon a dark train charged out of the east with fire and steam and thundered through the station. On its way it slowed at a platform littered with confetti, the tatters of ancient tickets punched by transient conductors.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;—Let us look each other in the face. We are Hyperboreans—we know well enough how remote our place is. “Neither by land nor by water will you find the road to the Hyperboreans”: even Pindar,[1] in his day, knew &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; much about us. Beyond the North, beyond the ice, beyond &lt;em&gt;death&lt;/em&gt;—&lt;em&gt;our&lt;/em&gt; life, &lt;em&gt;our&lt;/em&gt; happiness&amp;hellip;. We have discovered that happiness; we know the way; we got our knowledge of it from thousands of years in the labyrinth. Who &lt;em&gt;else&lt;/em&gt; has found it?—The man of today?—“I don’t know either the way out or the way in; I am whatever doesn’t know either the way out or the way in”—so sighs the man of today&amp;hellip;. &lt;em&gt;This&lt;/em&gt; is the sort of modernity that made us ill,—we sickened on lazy peace, cowardly compromise, the whole virtuous dirtiness of the modern Yea and Nay. This tolerance and &lt;em&gt;largeur&lt;/em&gt; of the heart that “forgives” everything because it “understands” everything is a sirocco to us. Rather live amid the ice than among modern virtues and other such south-winds!&amp;hellip; We were brave enough; we spared neither ourselves nor others; but we were a long time finding out &lt;em&gt;where&lt;/em&gt; to direct our courage. We grew dismal; they called us fatalists. &lt;em&gt;Our&lt;/em&gt; fate—it was the fulness, the tension, the &lt;em&gt;storing up&lt;/em&gt; of powers. We thirsted for the lightnings and great deeds; we kept as far as possible from the happiness of the weakling, from “resignation”&amp;hellip; There was thunder in our air; nature, as we embodied it, became overcast—&lt;em&gt;for we had not yet found the way&lt;/em&gt;. The formula of our happiness: a Yea, a Nay, a straight line, a &lt;em&gt;goal&lt;/em&gt;&amp;hellip;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The teachers of the purpose of existence.&lt;/em&gt; – Whether I regard human beings with a good or with an evil eye, I always find them engaged in a single task, each and every one of them: to do what benefits the preservation of the human race. Not from a feeling of love for the race, but simply because within them nothing is older, stronger, more inexorable and invincible than this instinct – because this instinct constitutes &lt;em&gt;the essence&lt;/em&gt; of our species and herd. One might quickly enough, with the usual myopia from five steps away, divide one’s neighbours into useful and harmful, good and evil; but on a large-scale assessment, upon further reflection on the whole, one grows suspicious of this tidying and separating and finally abandons it. Even the most harmful person may actually be the most useful when it comes to the preservation of the species; for he nurtures in himself or through his effects on others drives without which humanity would long since have become feeble or rotten. Hatred, delight in the misfortunes of others, the lust to rob and rule, and whatever else is called evil: all belong to the amazing economy of the preservation of the species, an economy which is certainly costly, wasteful, and on the whole most foolish – but still &lt;em&gt;proven&lt;/em&gt; to have preserved our race so far. I no longer know whether you, my dear fellow man and neighbour, are even &lt;em&gt;capable&lt;/em&gt; of living in a way which is damaging to the species, i.e. ‘unreasonably’ and ‘badly’. What &lt;em&gt;might&lt;/em&gt; have harmed the species may have become extinct many thousands of years ago and may by now belong to the things that are no longer possible even for God. Pursue your best or your worst desires, and above all, perish! In both cases you are probably still in some way a promoter and benefactor of humanity and are thus entitled to your eulogists – as well as to your mockers! But you will never find someone who could completely mock you, the individual, even in your best qualities, someone who could bring home to you as far as truth allows your boundless, fly- and frog-like wretchedness! To laugh at oneself as one would have to laugh in order to laugh &lt;em&gt;from the whole truth&lt;/em&gt; – for that, not even the best have had enough sense of truth, and the most gifted have had far too little genius! Perhaps even laughter still has a future – when the proposition ‘The species is everything, an individual is always nothing’ has become part of humanity and this ultimate liberation and irresponsibility is accessible to everyone at all times. Perhaps laughter will then have formed an alliance with wisdom; perhaps only ‘gay science’ will remain. At present, things are still quite different; at present, the comedy of existence has not yet ‘become conscious’ of itself; at present, we still live in the age of tragedy, in the age of moralities and religions. What is the meaning of the ever-new appearance of these founders of moralities and religions, of these instigators of fights about moral valuations, these teachers of pangs of conscience and religious wars? What is the meaning of these heroes on this stage? For these have been the heroes thus far; and everything else, even if at times it was all that we could see and was far too near, has always served only to set the stage for these heroes, whether as machinery and backdrop or in the role of confidant and servant. (The poets, for example, were always the servants of some kind of morality.) It is obvious that these tragedies, too, work in the interest of the &lt;em&gt;species,&lt;/em&gt; even if they should believe that they are working in the interest of God, as God’s emissaries. They, too, promote the life of the species &lt;em&gt;by promoting the faith in life.&lt;/em&gt; ‘Life is worth living’, each of them shouts, ‘there is something to life, there is something behind life, beneath it; beware!’ This drive, which rules the highest as well as the basest of human beings – the drive for the preservation of the species – erupts from time to time as reason and passion of mind; it is then surrounded by a resplendent retinue of reasons and tries with all its might to make us forget that fundamentally it is drive, instinct, stupidity, lack of reasons. Life &lt;em&gt;ought to&lt;/em&gt; be loved, &lt;em&gt;because&lt;/em&gt; –! Man &lt;em&gt;ought to&lt;/em&gt; advance himself and his neighbour, &lt;em&gt;because&lt;/em&gt; –! What names all these Oughts and Becauses have been given and may yet be given in the future! The ethical teacher makes his appearance as the teacher of the purpose of existence in order that what happens necessarily and always, by itself and without a purpose, shall henceforth seem to be done for a purpose and strike man as reason and an ultimate commandment; to this end he invents a second, different existence and takes by means of his new mechanics the old, ordinary existence off its old, ordinary hinges. To be sure, in no way does he want us to &lt;em&gt;laugh&lt;/em&gt; at existence, or at ourselves – or at him; for him, an individual is always an individual, something first and last and tremendous; for him there are no species, sums, or zeroes. Foolish and fanciful as his inventions and valuations may be, badly as he may misjudge the course of nature and deny its conditions – and all ethical systems hitherto have been so foolish and contrary to nature that humanity would have perished from every one had it gained power over humanity – all the same! Every time ‘the hero’ appeared on stage, something new was attained: the gruesome counterpart of laughter, that profound shock that many individuals feel at the thought: ‘Yes, living is worth it! Yes, I am worthy of living!’ Life and I and you and all of us became &lt;em&gt;interesting&lt;/em&gt; to ourselves once again for a while. There is no denying that &lt;em&gt;in the long run&lt;/em&gt; each of these great teachers of a purpose was vanquished by laughter, reason and nature: the brief tragedy always changed and returned into the eternal comedy of existence, and the ‘waves of uncountable laughter’ – to cite Aeschylus1 – must in the end also come crashing down on the greatest of these tragedians. Despite all this corrective laughter, human nature on the whole has surely been altered by the recurring emergence of such teachers of the purpose of existence – &lt;em&gt;it has acquired one additional need,&lt;/em&gt; the need for the repeated appearance of such teachers and such teachings of a ‘purpose’. Man has gradually become a fantastic animal that must fulfil one condition of existence more than any other animal: man &lt;em&gt;must&lt;/em&gt; from time to time believe he knows &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; he exists; his race cannot thrive without a periodic trust in life – without faith in the &lt;em&gt;reason in life!&lt;/em&gt; And ever again the human race will from time to time decree: ‘There is something one is absolutely forbidden henceforth to laugh at.’ And the most cautious friend of man will add: ‘Not only laughter and gay wisdom but also the tragic, with all its sublime unreason, belongs to the means and necessities of the preservation of the species.’ And therefore! Therefore! Therefore! Oh, do you understand me, my brothers? Do you understand this new law of ebb and flood? We, too, have our time!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

There he enjoyed his spirit and solitude, and for ten years did not weary of it. But at last his heart changed,—and rising one morning with the rosy dawn, he went before the sun, and spake thus unto it:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Thou great star! What would be thy happiness if thou hadst not those for whom thou shinest!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Lady Blennerhasset, a well-known literary and social figure of the last quarter of the nineteenth century, wrote to Mrs Max Muller after the death of her husband ‘My admiration for your husband makes me envy the task of him or her, who will be his biographer There are few lives so rich, so attractive, so truly interesting, from the intellectual and purely human point of view ’&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;During the four years which I took to write this biography I have felt that she was right in saying so It has been a memorable experience for me, and not merely a task The introduction which follows will explain why I undertook to write Max Muller’s life anew after the first and last biography so far written was published in 1902 Here I shall only set down my obligations&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I appreciate all the advice, intentional and inadvertent, that I received from everyone who read this manuscript in its various stages of comple tion, including Pamela Barinoff, Hart de Fouw, Gulrukh Irani, Margaret Mahan, Roshni Panday, John Pilskog, Lynda Raby, Dr. Fred Smith, Bill Vincent and Claudia Welch. I thank the machines, including especially my computer, that have made it so easy for me to rewrite this work so many times. I bow down to Vimalananda&amp;rsquo;s Guru Maharaj, whose blessings tran scend time and space to continue to preserve and protect me. Most of all, I esteem those players without whom there would have been no story: the stouthearted foals and yearlings, fillies and colts, geldings, stallions and mares that raced in Western India during my tenure there. Finally, I salute the man who moment by moment enlivened this story for me as he creat ed it: the peerless Vimalananda.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;When I met Vimalananda I had already been living in the city of Poona for more than a year, studying Ayurveda, India&amp;rsquo;s ancient medical system, and yoga. I had spiritual ambitions but despite guidance from saintly personages I had no real idea of my ultimate spiritual aim. Still, I dutifully invested many hours each day in postures and breathing exercises, holy books, incense and meditation while I waited impatiently for something to happen.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Friedrich Max Muller was bom on December 6, 1823, in the town of Dessau, now in eastern Germany, but then the capital of a sovereign State, though a very small one Indeed, Anhalt-Dessau was so small that when in the revolutionary days of mid-mneteenthcentury Germany, a troublesome political agitator was expelled from the principality he threatened to break the windows of the ruler’s palace by throwing stones from across the border That would have been, not petty mischief-making, but a very appropriate symbolic gesture, for the Schloss or the ducal palace was the focal point of the life of the whole population of the State, irrespective of class and station The building itself was both old and imposing, with a large quadrangle in front, from which staircases supported by turrets led up to the reception rooms The impression it made on Muller as a boy, he put in the mouth of the young hero of the only story he ever wrote&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;“Yes, that is a separate thing, but it is still the same principle: the food acts as a carrier, a via media, for whatever vibrations are added to it. Remember that Shaktipat Diksha can be given with water, or with some other substance that the disciple ingests. Every time you eat something, you are imbibing unaware all sorts of vibrations, all sorts of shaktis, some of which may be very unbalancing to your system.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

This ought really to be known already: for I have not neglected to ‘bear witness’ about myself. But the disparity between the greatness of my task and the &lt;em&gt;smallness&lt;/em&gt; of my contemporaries has found expression in the fact that I have been neither heard nor even so much as seen. I live on my own credit, it is perhaps merely a prejudice that I am alive at all?… I need only to talk with any of the ‘cultured people’ who come to the Ober-Engadin in the summer to convince myself that I am &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; alive… Under these circumstances there exists a duty against which my habit, even more the pride of my instincts revolts, namely to say: &lt;em&gt;Listen to me! for I am thus and thus. Do not, above all, confound me with what I am not!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Natural potential for spiritual development becomes valuable only by careful cultivation. All spiritual practices are sadhanas, but all sadhanas are not created equal. Vimalananda explains:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;“The Rishis, India&amp;rsquo;s Seers, have understood our plight, and in their great magnanimity have created sadhanas by which we can extricate ourselves from our limitations and make progress. The Rishis have created many dif ferent sadhanas because there are so many different types of people, each of whom have special requirements. We Aghoris believe in using fast, terrifying methods of sadhana because we ache to return to God immediately; we cannot bear being separated from Him.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;To be a guru you have to say, “I know and I can teach you.” But if I say that, well, I’m finished. I can never learn anything else. I have shut myself off from anything new. If I remain a student all my life, though, I will always be ready to learn new things.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I never call any of the people who come to me for spiritual guidance “disciples.” I am just an ordinary person. I have lived unknown and I will die unknown, except to a few. I am not interested in anything the world can offer me and even if I die tomorrow I have no regrets. I have lived my life to the fullest; I have done enough. I’ll always be thankful to Nature for permitting me to achieve so much. I will never have disciples, only “children,” because that is the way a real guru should treat a disciple: as a spiritual son or daughter. And the bond between them is far more intense than that between a physical parent and child.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;“Many people talk about Mantra Siddhi (the manifestation of the deity inherent in the mantra), but I am afraid that most of them have missed the boat. Let&amp;rsquo;s say that I want to locate you, and I know your name. But that alone is not enough. I must also know what you look like and where you live, because there may be many people with the same name. Only if I know your likes and dislikes, your temperament, all the facets of your character, do I really know you. Then I can locate you.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;So any kind of music, Western, Indian, or anything else, can give you results if you are sincere about it and make it into a sadhana,&amp;rdquo; I said.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;You can. I am sure that if Tukaram Maharaj, who lived here in Maharashtra almost four hundred years ago, were to come here to Bombay today and we were to play some nice Western song for him he would sit quietly and listen and enjoy it—or at least he would look as if he were enjoying it. All the time on the inside he would be hearing his mantra &amp;lsquo;Rama Krishna Hari, Jai Jai Rama Krishna Hari; Rama Krishna Hari, Jai Jai Rama Krishna Hari -set to the rhythm and melody of the music.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Chapter i&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;POLEMICS POLITICAL AND SCHOLARLY&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In his conscious formulation of an ideal of life Max Muller wanted to be a studious recluse, seeking knowledge and truth for their own sake, and believing that there must be a division of labour in human activities&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;None the less, all through life he was involving himself in political controversies, and showing himself eager to fight the opinions of majorities when they were baying in a pack out of nationalistic passions This was due to his interest in politics As a student in Germany he was a liberal nationalist As an adult scholar in England he remained the same liberal, and associated with the English Liberals At no age did he shrink from expressing his opinions in conversation or correspondence Though the realization of German unity and the creation of the German Empire in 1870 satisfied his nationalism, he never ceased to take an interest in Anglo-German friendship in the international field Even in his letters to his young son he set down his political views very freely&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;“Actually there is no difference betwen the Kundalini Shakti and Adya, the original Shakti of the universe, except that the Kundalini Shakti has become individualized.”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Vimalananda was not one to repeat himself; as soon as he began to speak about something of interest to me I was expected to drop whatever I was doing and listen. Usually he picked moments when I was engrossed in some mundane matter like reading the newspaper, since drawing my atten tion to his words would disengage my mind at least temporarily from its attachment to the mundane.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;The universe is endless and beginningless.&amp;rdquo; Vimalananda was in a mood to talk, and plenty of time lay before us. “If you are sincere and work hard you will eventually reach the state of continual awareness that you are the Universal Soul, the One, the Atman or Brahman. Then you can truthfully say to yourself, &amp;lsquo;Aham Brahmasmi; I am Brahman.&amp;rsquo; Our mortal consciousness has three normal states: waking, dream, and deep sleep. Turiya is the state beyond these three. In Turiya you are continually aware of being Brahman, the Absolute Reality, and of Brahman being all. But it is only the beginning.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

We had reached there well in advance of the first race, and while we awaited the arrival of his colleagues, the friendly gamblers with whom he would wrangle, wager and roar, the man who was my mentor sprang this question on me.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Valmiki was not born a Rishi; in fact, he was a bandit. His job was waylaying people and robbing them. Sometimes he would hold them for ransom, or even kill them. Occasionally he would let them go. One day Valmiki caught the celestial troublemaker Narada, and told him that he would have to die because he had nothing of value to steal.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In his youth Vimalananda had studied astrology with Jina Chandra Suri, and 1 frequently witnessed his amazing ability to cast an accurate horoscope from a visitor&amp;rsquo;s face alone. Though astrology is a respected means of diagno sis in Ayurveda it is no longer taught in Ayurvedic colleges, and I held out some hope that Vimalananda would teach me himself. But every time I asked for instruction he would refuse, saying, “You have more important things to learn right now.&amp;quot; He relented only with regard to those aspects of astrology which he felt would be materially beneficial to my sadhana.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Yantra, meaning &amp;ldquo;device&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;instrument,&amp;rdquo; is usually a geometric repre sentation designed to identify the mind of a worshipper with his or her cho sen deity. The Yogini Tantra says that the goddess may either be worshipped as image, mandala or yantra. A yantra is the outward form of a deity, while a mantra is the deities&amp;rsquo; subtle form. In essence the mantra is the deity, and when a yantra is inscribed with its bija mantras and empowered by conse cration the deity is installed within the yantra. Empowerment is the entry of the deities&amp;rsquo; prana into the yantra, and without this the yantra is but an empty construction. When a yantra is consecrated by auspicious rites it brings prosperity and peace and removes all malevolent influences from the worshippers family. Yantras can be used for magical purposes and when employed in destructive rituals the yantra becomes more a prison than a palace for the deity.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Oh, the logistics of the rocket. Computerize the billion and one decisions. Ten thousand nursing bottles filled with super-homogenized gunk for space children. Fresh air produced by glass-enclosed botanical gardens. Sweat recycled into sweet water by machines.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Ring all the bells and klaxons. Flash the lights and prepare the thunders. Men and women run.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Quell and I stood by the gantry, staring up at the giant ship. It had been a week since our strange encounter with Elijah, seven days filled with intense activity as the &lt;em&gt;Cetus 7&lt;/em&gt; crew, of which we were now members, prepared the ship for voyage.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Because.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In his half-sleep last night he had felt something writing on the insides of his eyelids.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Without opening his eyes he read the words as they scrolled:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Somewhere a band is playing,&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Playing the strangest tunes,&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Of sunflower seeds and sailors&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Somewhere a drummer simmers&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;And trembles with times forlorn,&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Remembering days of summer&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;In futures yet unborn.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;“Hold on,” he heard himself say.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;He opened his eyes and the writing stopped.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Intellectual conscience.&lt;/em&gt; – I keep having the same experience and keep resisting it anew each time; I do not want to believe it although I can grasp it as with my hands: &lt;em&gt;the great majority lacks an intellectual conscience&lt;/em&gt; – indeed, it has often seemed to me as if someone requiring such a conscience would be as lonely in the most densely populated cities as he would be in the desert. Everyone looks at you with strange eyes and goes on handling their scales, calling this good and that evil; nobody as much as blushes when you notice that their weights are underweight – nor do they become indignant with you; perhaps they laugh at your doubts. I mean: &lt;em&gt;to the great majority&lt;/em&gt; it is not contemptible to believe this or that and to live accordingly &lt;em&gt;without&lt;/em&gt; first becoming aware of the final and most certain reasons pro and con, and without even troubling themselves about such reasons afterwards: the most gifted men and the noblest women still belong to this ‘great majority’. But what are goodheartedness, refinement, and genius to me when the person possessing these virtues tolerates slack feelings in his believing and judging and when he does not consider &lt;em&gt;the desire for certainty&lt;/em&gt; to be his inmost craving and deepest need – as that which separates the higher human beings from the lower! I discovered in certain pious people a hatred of reason and I was well disposed towards them for that: at least this betrayed their bad intellectual conscience! But to stand in the midst of this &lt;em&gt;rerum concordia discors&lt;/em&gt;2 and the whole marvellous uncertainty and ambiguity of existence &lt;em&gt;without questioning,&lt;/em&gt; without trembling with the craving and rapture of questioning, without at least hating the person who questions, perhaps even being faintly amused by him – that is what I feel to be &lt;em&gt;contemptible,&lt;/em&gt; and this is the feeling I look for first in anyone. Some folly keeps persuading me that every person has this feeling, simply as human. That is my type of injustice.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

His soul, however, became impatient and full of longing for those whom he loved: because he had still much to give them. For this is hardest of all: to close the open hand out of love, and keep modest as a giver.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Chapter 2&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;BEATA GEORGINA&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There is a gap of two years in the story of Max Muller’s love for Georgina Grenfell, between the spring of 1854 when his proposal for marriage was rejected by her family, and the spring of 1856 when a love affair acknowledged and accepted by Georgina but without any hope of marriage began for them What happened in the intervening years is unrecorded both in the published biography and unpublished papers All that can be said is that Muller did not forget his love, and remained dejected But since he did not meet Georgina his suffering was not such that he could not put on a brave face to his mother, as he felt he must, because he knew that nothing would distress her more than the knowledge of his being unhappy in love So, to one of her letters written in 1855, in which there was the usual insistence on his marrying and even a suggestion as to a possible wife, he replied with humour ‘That you are so anxious to find me a wife is very good of you 1 Elise who delighted you so much in Carlsbad, seemed to me pleasant enough, but as I had no opportunity of knowing her better, I have never thought more about her If you are writing greet her kindly, but don’t make any proposal for her hand*’ The future Mrs Muller, on the othei hand, knew nothing of Max Muller’s love and was not herself consciously in love But the whole aspect of their relations changed dramatically in the early summer of 1856&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;“While Kundalini sleeps in the Muladhara Chakra at the base of the spine you are awake to the world and asleep to reality. When She awakes to unite with Her Shiva in your brain then you wake up to reality; you &amp;lsquo;fall asleep&amp;rsquo; to the world. An ignorant person believes that he is in the world; his Kundalini self-identifies with the poison of Maya. A jnani, one who knows, says rather, ‘The world is in me,&amp;rsquo; because his Kundalini self-identifies with Shiva.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I MET VIMALANANDA first in September 1975 on the day that Elan, one of his most reliable mares, won her first race for him. I first accompanied him to the races on the day of Stoney&amp;rsquo;s last outing. Horse racing began in Bombay in the early decades of the nineteenth century when a race ground emerged in what is now the predominantly Christian district of Byculla. When the time came to search for greener pastures, the Royal Western India Turf Club Limited (R.W.I.T.C. for short) selected a low-lying site near Bombay&amp;rsquo;s fa mous temple of Mahalakshmi, the goddess of wealth and prosperity. Most members of the Indian racing public mistakenly assume that the Mahalak shmi racecourse, which is among the world&amp;rsquo;s most beautiful wagering ven ues, was a British production. In truth it was an Indian, Sir Cusrow N. Wadia, the Parsi who was then head of the textile giant Bombay Dyeing, who over saw the entire project from concept through planning to construction. He gave the club an interest-free loan of Rs. 4 million ($10 million or more in to day&amp;rsquo;s dollars) and went himself to Melbourne, Australia to obtain a blue print. Thanks to his farsightedness there is only one turn for all races up to and including 1600 meters (one mile).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The fact that Max Muller was German by birth and spent his early life in Germany, has quite unnecessarily fixed the idea that he was a German scholar writing in German Actually, he was naturalized in England and always wrote in English with complete mastery of the language, except when he employed German for a special purpose in a book, article, or his correspondence The lists given in the two appendices specify which books or documents are in German All others are in his own English&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Gay Science&lt;/em&gt; is a remarkable book, both in itself and as offering a way into some of Nietzsche’s most important ideas. The history of its publication is rather complex, and it throws some light on the development of his thought and of his methods as a writer. He published the first edition of it in 1882. In that version, it consisted of only four books, and had no Preface, though it did have the ‘Prelude in Rhymes’. A second edition appeared in 1887, which added a fifth book, the Preface, and an Appendix of further poems. This is the work as we now know it, and which is translated here.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It is always better to live with reality, because otherwise, without fail, reality will come to live with you. —The Aghori Vimalananda&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;IF TO BE RELIGIOUS, in the truest sense of that much misunderstood word, is to thirst for water from reality&amp;rsquo;s fountain, then to walk the spiritual path is to turn your compass toward its ever-flowing well. The organized reli gions, which have set up camps downstream from that spring, all provide sketchy maps that trace a single trail to the source. The one map illuminating all the tracks leading spiritwards through the diverse terrains of existence is accessible only through the world&amp;rsquo;s sole dogma-free spiritual trekking agency: Aghora. Aghora, which literally means &amp;ldquo;unagitated,&amp;rdquo; teaches aghoris (its practitioners) to focus and intensify their craving for reality until they learn how to transcend all that galls (the ghora) in life. Then no internal or external stimulus, however ordinarily agitating,&amp;rsquo; will be able to interrupt or interfere with their one-pointed guzzling of the nectar of being.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;He described it one evening shortly thereafter, over Scotch.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;“My family belongs to the Pushti Marga, the spiritual path (marga) whose greatest exponent was Vallabhacharya, who lived more than five hundred years ago. Some people translate &amp;lsquo;Pushti Marga&amp;rsquo; as &amp;lsquo;Path of Prosperity,&amp;rsquo; and others as ‘Path of Grace.&amp;rsquo; But when I think of pushti I remember a phrase from the Maha Mrytunjaya Mantra.” He looked at me expectantly.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;You mean, &amp;lsquo;sugandhim pushti vardhanam?&amp;rdquo; I asked.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Chapter 2&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;LIFE, LOVE AND DEATH&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;From all the accounts that Max Muller gave of his intellectual aims, methods and work it could be seen that he was less a scholar m the strict sense of the word than an intellectual, and the difference is basic It is that which distinguishes a painter or sculptor from a craftsman What then is an intellectual ? An intellectual is a man or woman who applies his intellectual faculties to understanding and interpreting the world around him in any or all its aspects As a result of study, observation or experiment, he formulates conclusions which he believes to be true and communicates his ideas to his fellow-men with a view to influencing their minds, lives and actions&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Every month or two, when the mood possessed him, Vimalananda would take me and Roshni with him to the Lakshmi-Narayana temple in Central Bombay, to look upon the face of God. The images in this temple are carved from pure white marble, and their sweetness and sublimity effortlessly pierce the hearts of those who gaze at them in faith. All the humans there the temple trustees, the priests, the watchmen&amp;ndash;knew Vimalananda, and all were happy to see him arrive, all except the musicians, who were envious of his superior musical abilities. After making our offerings Vimalananda&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;But since right now I do know what time it is,” I said, “all these anustha nas and so on will not only help awaken my mantra but will also help me develop my devotion.”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;“That&amp;rsquo;s right.” &amp;ldquo;Are there other practices I should know about?” I asked, knowing well that he expected me to continue asking even if I did not know what to ask.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Well, there is nyasa. Very few people talk about nyasa, because so few people know about it. But without nyasa there is no Tantra.”&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;“You know, the whole purpose of Tantra is to free us from all limitations. The world is full of negative influences that limit our consciousnesses, and one of the greatest of these limitations is that of the Five Great Elements which make up the universe. If you can purify these Elements within you you can free yourself from their influence, and then your Kundalini will be free to rise unimpeded. As I have told you before, Bhuta Shuddhi is the essence of Tantra. All puja (ritual worship) is really Bhuta Shuddhi, and it is impossible to worship Shakti unless you use representatives of the Five Ele ments in some form or another to help purify those very Elements.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;After pausing to light a cigarette, Vimalananda continued.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;“To become a Siddha is wonderful-marvelous&amp;ndash;but it is not the ulti mate. If your Kundalini should ever reach the Sahasrara you will see so many things that you will be amazed. You will see hundreds and hundreds of flow ers of all colors. Each of those flowers is a shakti, and if you pluck one of them you will get that shakti, which will keep you on the periphery. You will form a little orbit for yourself, and you may remain there for ages. Siddhas usually stay in their own orbits because they are so fascinated by what they have achieved. Only if they are forcibly pulled further by some higher authority will they move ahead, and when they do they see that there are much better orbits to move into.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;When I’m disgusted, fed up with the world, I always turn to my Mother. She comes to me in any form I request, and we play that way. Sometimes She comes as my Mother, sometimes as my wife, sometimes as my child. She’s always with me; She’ll never go away. Long ago we promised each other to stay together always. If She ever leaves me I will not live even an instant longer. Who is She? My ego, the Shakti which self-identifies with my body. If She leaves me I have to die. Most people don’t know the true value of the ego, and they misuse Her. But I think I am the luckiest man in the world, because my Smashan Tara has taught me all about my own ego, and how to realize Her as Adya, the Original Shakti. She is the being to be realized.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;a&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The tradition of the Nine Nath Siddhas stems from the flowering of Shai vite Tantra around the tenth century. The word Nath is derived from the name of Shiva and its literal meaning is &amp;ldquo;Lord.&amp;rdquo; The Naths brought to light various systems of tantric practices aimed at the transubrantation of the human body into a divine immortal body. Central to their methods were the practices of Hatha, Kundalini and Alchemical yogas. The North Indian tradi tion lists nine Naths and eighty-four Siddhas in its lineage, the most promi nent of which were Matsyendranath and Gorakhnath. Many of these eighty four Siddhas appear in the Buddhist tantric tradition, where it is sometimes said that they practiced Hindu tantra by day and Buddhist tantra at night. The various lists of the Nine Naths include: Matsyendranath, Gorakhnath, Jalandhara, Kanipa, Gopichand, Caurangi, Charpati, Dharamnath and Gaininath.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;“Rama, the Indwelling Spirit, is called Raja (King) Rama because He is king of the seventy-two thousand nadis. Krishna also rules the nadis, but His Lila is different; He has a love affair with them. Some people find it eas ier to relate to the Soul as King; others prefer to relate to It as Lover. You must find which way agrees best with your temperament, and relate in that way. As they say, &amp;rsquo;the Truth is One; the learned describe It in many ways.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;How will I know which form I have an affinity for?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;“That is the job of your guru, to assign you the proper mantra and the proper form. He will know which mantras are appropriate for you. If you are of a very tender nature and you start to repeat a mantra for some terrifying deity like Smashan Tara you may scare yourself to death. If you are prone to greed and you worship Lakshmi, the goddess of wealth, you may simply enhance your greed, which will not help you progress. This is why a guru is necessary: to teach you what you need to learn. People are amazing nowa days; they tell the guru what they want to learn from him, instead of trying to find out from him what they need to know. Is there anything more ridic ulous?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;1&#34;&gt;1&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;THE fortunateness of my existence, its uniqueness perhaps, lies in its fatality: to express it in the form of a riddle, as my father I have already died, as my mother I still live and grow old. This twofold origin, as it were from the highest and the lowest rung of the ladder of life, at once &lt;em&gt;décadent&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;beginning&lt;/em&gt; – this if anything explains that neutrality, that freedom from party in relation to the total problem of life which perhaps distinguishes me. I have a subtler sense for signs of ascent and decline than any man has ever had, I am the teacher &lt;em&gt;par excellence&lt;/em&gt; in this matter – I know both, I am both. – My father died at the age of thirty-six: he was delicate, lovable and morbid, like a being destined to pay this world only a passing visit – a gracious reminder of life rather than life itself. In the same year in which his life declined mine too declined: in the thirty-sixth year of my life I arrived at the lowest point of my vitality – I still lived, but without being able to see three paces in front of me. At that time – it was 1879 – I relinquished my Basel professorship, lived through the summer like a shadow in St Moritz and the following winter, the most sunless of my life, &lt;em&gt;as&lt;/em&gt; a shadow in Naumburg. This was my minimum: ‘The Wanderer and his Shadow’ came into existence during the course of it. I undoubtedly knew all about shadows in those days… In the following winter, the first winter I spent in Genoa, that sweetening and spiritualization which is virtually inseparable from an extreme poverty of blood and muscle produced ‘Daybreak’. The perfect brightness and cheerfulness, even exuberance of spirit reflected in the said work is in my case compatible not only with the profoundest physiological weakness, but even with an extremity of pain. In the midst of the torments which attended an uninterrupted three-day headache accompanied by the laborious vomiting of phlegm – I possessed a dialectical clarity &lt;em&gt;par excellence&lt;/em&gt; and thought my way very cold-bloodedly through things for which when I am in better health I am not enough of a climber, not refined, not &lt;em&gt;cold&lt;/em&gt; enough. My readers perhaps know the extent to which I regard dialectics as a symptom of &lt;em&gt;décadence,&lt;/em&gt; for example in the most famous case of all: in the case of Socrates. – All morbid disturbances of the intellect, even that semi-stupefaction consequent on fever, have remained to this day totally unfamiliar things to me, on their nature and frequency I had first to instruct myself by scholarly methods. My blood flows slowly. No one has ever been able to diagnose fever in me. A doctor who treated me for some time as a nervous case said at last: ‘No! there is nothing wrong with your nerves, it is only I who am nervous.’ Any kind of local degeneration absolutely undemonstrable; no organically originating stomach ailment, though there does exist, as a consequence of general exhaustion, a profound weakness of the gastric system. Condition of the eyes, sometimes approaching dangerously close to blindness, also only consequence, not causal: so that with every increase in vitality eyesight has also again improved. – Convalescence means with me a long, all too long succession of years – it also unfortunately means relapse, deterioration, periods of a kind of &lt;em&gt;décadence.&lt;/em&gt; After all this do I need to say that in questions of &lt;em&gt;décadence&lt;/em&gt; I am &lt;em&gt;experienced?&lt;/em&gt; I have spelled it out forwards and backwards. Even that filigree art of grasping and comprehending in general, that finger for nuances, that psychology of ‘looking around the corner’ and whatever else characterizes me was learned only then, is the actual gift of that time in which everything in me became more subtle, observation itself together with all the organs of observation. To look from a morbid perspective towards &lt;em&gt;healthier&lt;/em&gt; concepts and values, and again conversely to look down from the abundance and certainty of &lt;em&gt;rich&lt;/em&gt; life into the secret labour of the instinct of &lt;em&gt;décadence&lt;/em&gt; – that is what I have practised most, it has been my own particular field of experience, in this if in anything I am a master. I now have the skill and knowledge to &lt;em&gt;invert perspectives:&lt;/em&gt; first reason why a ‘revaluation of values’ is perhaps possible at all to me alone. –&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A voice boomed over the loudspeakers. “The captain is in quarters, prepare for countdown.”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The crew all hurried to their assigned stations, suited up and strapped in. The great doors were shut and sealed, the gantries rolled away, the engines fired up.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;“Minus one and counting.”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We lay waiting for the fire-wind to seize and throw us at the sky.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;And seize and throw it did.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Oh my God, I thought.

But when the train slowed, I jumped, because …&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;He turned and saw a wind-battered sign over the flimsy station that seemed about to sink under tides of sand: SUMMERTON, ARIZONA.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;“Yes, sir,” said a voice.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The traveler dropped his gaze to find a man of some middle years with fair hair and clear eyes seated on the porch of the ramshackle station, leaning back in shadow. An assortment of hats hung above him, which read: TICKET SELLER, BAGGAGE MASTER, SWITCHMAN, NIGHT WATCHMAN, TAXI. Upon his head was a cap with the word STATIONMASTER stitched on its bill in bright red thread.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The problem that I set here is not what shall replace mankind in the order of living creatures (—man is an end—): but what type of man must be &lt;em&gt;bred&lt;/em&gt;, must be &lt;em&gt;willed&lt;/em&gt;, as being the most valuable, the most worthy of life, the most secure guarantee of the future.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This more valuable type has appeared often enough in the past: but always as a happy accident, as an exception, never as deliberately &lt;em&gt;willed&lt;/em&gt;. Very often it has been precisely the most feared; hitherto it has been almost &lt;em&gt;the&lt;/em&gt; terror of terrors;—and out of that terror the contrary type has been willed, cultivated and &lt;em&gt;attained&lt;/em&gt;: the domestic animal, the herd animal, the sick brute-man—the Christian&amp;hellip;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Noble and common.&lt;/em&gt; – For common natures all noble, magnanimous feelings appear to be inexpedient and therefore initially incredible: they give a wink when they hear of such things and seem to want to say, ‘Surely there must be some advantage involved; one cannot see through every wall’ – they are suspicious of the noble person, as if he were furtively seeking his advantage. If they become all too clearly convinced of the absence of selfish intentions and gains, they view the noble person as a kind of fool: they despise him in his pleasure and laugh at the sparkle in his eye. ‘How could one enjoy being at a disadvantage? How could one want with open eyes to be disadvantaged? Some disease of reason must be linked to the noble affection’ – thus they think and look disparagingly, the way they disparage the pleasure that a madman derives from his fixed idea. What distinguishes the common nature is that it unflinchingly keeps sight of its advantage, and that this thought of purpose and advantage is even stronger than its strongest drives; not to allow these drives to lead it astray to perform inexpeditious acts – that is its wisdom and self-esteem. In comparison, the higher nature is more &lt;em&gt;unreasonable&lt;/em&gt; – for the noble, magnanimous, and self-sacrificing person does in fact succumb to his drives; and in his best moments, his reason &lt;em&gt;pauses.&lt;/em&gt; An animal that protects its young at the risk of its own life or during the mating period follows the female unto death does not think of danger and death; its reason likewise pauses because the pleasure in its brood or in the female and the fear of being deprived of this pleasure dominate it totally; the animal becomes stupider than it usually is – just like the person who is noble and magnanimous. Such persons have several feelings of pleasure and displeasure so strong that they reduce the intellect to silence or to servitude: at that point their heart displaces their head, and one speaks thenceforth of ‘passion’. (Occasionally we also encounter the opposite, the ‘reversal of passion’, as it were; for example, somebody once laid his hand on Fontenelle’s heart and said, ‘What you have here, my dear sir, is also brains.’3) The unreason or odd reason (&lt;em&gt;Unvernunft oder Quervernunft&lt;/em&gt;) of passion is what the common type despises in the noble, especially when this passion is directed at objects whose value seems quite fantastic and arbitrary. He is annoyed by the person who succumbs to the passion of the belly, but at least he comprehends the appeal that plays the tyrant in this case; but he cannot comprehend how anyone could, for example, risk health and honour for the sake of a passion for knowledge. The higher nature’s taste is for exceptions, for things that leave most people cold and seem to lack sweetness; the higher nature has a singular value standard. Moreover, it usually believes that the idiosyncrasy of its taste is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; a singular value standard; rather, it posits its values and disvalues as generally valid and so becomes incomprehensible and impractical. It is very rare that a higher nature has enough reason left over to understand and treat commonplace people as what they are; above all, it believes in its own passion as something that is present in everyone but concealed, and in this belief it is full of ardour and eloquence. Now when such exceptional people do not themselves feel like exceptions, how can they ever understand the common natures and arrive at a proper estimate of the rule! – and so they, too, speak of the stupidity, inexpedience, and fancifulness of humanity, stunned that the world is taking such an insane course and that it will not commit itself to that which ‘is needful’. – This is the eternal injustice of the noble.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

For there was a good roadstead there, in which foreign ships also liked to anchor: those ships took many people with them, who wished to cross over from the Happy Isles. So when Zarathustra thus ascended the mountain, he thought on the way of his many solitary wanderings from youth onwards, and how many mountains and ridges and summits he had already climbed.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Vimalananda explains the concept thusly (from Chapter Two): “The purpose of Kundalini Yoga is to reunite Shiva and Shakti, to create the eternal form of Shiva, Sadashiva. Sadashiva&amp;rsquo;s left side is female and right side is male; the two principles have united but have not merged. If they were to merge that would be the end of the play, and that would be no fun at all. Sadashiva exists on the cosmic scale; in an indi vidual this deity is called Ardhanarishvara (“the Lord Who is Half Female&amp;rsquo;). In order to manifest Sadashiva the Kundalini must be made to rise fully, because the highest manifestation of Shiva in the human being is in the head, the highest part of the body.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Vimalananda paused for a moment and looked up to an image of Anjaneya, better known as Hanuman. His lip quivered almost imperceptibly with emotion as he spoke again.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Anjaneya flew to Lanka, located Sita, and assured her that Rama was coming to rescue her. Before returning to Rama with the news of Sita&amp;rsquo;s whereabouts Anjaneya allowed himself to be captured and taken before Ravana to make Ravana aware of the gravity of what he had done. Then Anjaneya burned the city of Lanka to the ground, destroying Ravana&amp;rsquo;s lovely fantasy world.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Chapter 3&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;FORMATION OF MIND AND CHARACTER&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When Max Muller ended his wander] ahre by taking up residence at Oxford, he was six months short of being twenty-five, and his personality, in its dual aspect of mind and character, was already formed in its structure and functioning After that, so far as his own development was concerned, he was to go on adding to the content of his mind But henceforth he was also to give his mind a new role — that of impinging on other minds as teacher and writer The publication of the first volume of his edition of the Rig-Veda in 1849 was symbolic of his transition from purely internal growth to external projection, which gained strength from year to year until m the last quarter of the nineteenth century he came to be accepted as one of the outstanding figures in the world of European thought At this point of transition it is necessary to take stock of his mind and character as these were then, and also to consider the influences which shaped them Perhaps the scope of this chapter will be more correctly stated if I say that in it I shall analyse young Muller’s personality as the product of a historical process What was distinctively personal in his qualities and activities will come out of the whole account of his life What it is necessary to examine here is the relationship between his personality and the particular environment, both social and psychological, in which he grew up This alone can place his individuality in its rightful historical setting The particularity of individual human-beings is geneially very much exaggerated, and in regarding every person as unique, as he in one sense certainly is, it is invariably forgotten that his particularity is only the psychological counterpart of what is known as continuous somatic variation in zoology, which makes every cat or dog equally particular It is only in the case of very exceptional persons that it is safe to attribute true individuality, and even then it cannot be assumed absolutely, for such men would also be found to be the products of a particular historical process Real originality is the surplus value which enables the exceptional man to give an added momentum to the process of which he is the product.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Chapter 3&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;INDIA. MEN&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When Max Muller told his son to grow fond of someone or something and so be raised to the intensity of a passion, he was thinking of his own life Whatever his love for someone might have brought him, his fondness for something never disappointed him That was India, adopted as a boy&amp;rsquo;s dream and pursued through life as an object of love Many people looked upon this as his great illusion It could be, for he could create an India of his own, as Pygmalion did with his Galatea Though absorbed in India all his life, he never visited the country In early life he could not because his mother thought that England was far enough His love affair and marriage also prevented it In middle age he was too busy at Oxford, and when old he felt that a visit to India would be too great a physical strain Among Indians the legend grew that he believed their country to have been the land of his previous birth, and that to see it might prove a fatal shock of joy&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Other Nadas are also described in the books, but these two are the most important.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;“Let me try to explain to you the differences in Nada by describing how Krishna&amp;rsquo;s hair differs from Shiva&amp;rsquo;s hair.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Chapter 3&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;LANGUAGE&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To Max Muller the Rig-Veda , which kept him occupied fully or partly for thirty years, was only a means to an end Not that he ever underrated the value of the means, absolute or relative, on the contrary, he emphasized its importance so much that people might justifiably have thought of him as a man who was riding a hobbyhorse Conscious of this, he again and again made out a case for studying the Rig-Veda Nevertheless, the establishment of its text and that of Sayana’s commentary, followed by an attempt to understand its meaning, was to him the preliminary investigation in a wider quest — the examination, in a particular field, of phenomena he was primarily interested in and wanted to understand In short, his work on the Rtg-Veda could be compared to the experiments carried out by a theoretical physicist or, better still, to the investigations of Darwin&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>03 Mental Worship</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;“Now, although there are many different ways to worship, I have always believed it is best to worship mentally, if you can. Physical worship is always limited, especially now during Kali Yuga, when not even the experts are always able to do their physical worship properly. Even the most proficient devotee must occasionally make a mistake in his or her ritual; even the best trained mouth must sometimes mispronounce a mantra. And in some sadhanas if you make even a minor mistake you are gone. To avoid all possi bility of error it is always better to worship mentally instead of physically. There is nothing to misplace, nothing to spill, and no fear of mistake. This is what the Tantras mean when they call for &amp;lsquo;internal sacrificial rites.&amp;rsquo; Do you think this is so easy? In almost every case nowadays only the show remains; the internal techniques have been lost, except to the chosen few.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;“The ego or ahamkara does not actually reside in the physical body, because the ego is not at all physical. It resides in the subtle body, and moves in the nadis, the ethereal nerves. The body&amp;rsquo;s 72,000 nadis act as con duits for prana, which is closely related to the ego. Numerologically, 72,000 means 7 + 2 = 9: the Nine Doors through which prana can enter or leave the body. Most of the nadis begin or terminate at these Doors, which are the sense organs: the two eyes, the two nostrils, the two ears, the mouth, the anus, and the genital organ. Prana, moving with the breaths, enkindles the body&amp;rsquo;s fire, just as a bellows is used to ignite and inflame the fire in a forge, and the mind is carried out through these Doors by prana so that it can experience the world. Control of the nadis enables you to control the ego, the mind and the senses.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;To meet a Nath, Muni or Rishi, or one of the Supreme Shaktis, is almost impossible. But you may be able to meet Siddhas. I was very fortunate to have met Telang Swami (see Aghora), who was a great Siddha. When I was in&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;12121&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;IMMORTALS&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;the Himalayas I met Babaji, the Siddha who Yogananda talks about. Babaji is a good Siddha, no doubt, but his sister is even better than he is!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The world considers You inauspicious, O Destroyer of Lust who plays in the smashan smeared with the ash from funeral pyres, wearing a necklace of human skulls, with ghouls for comrades. But for those who remember You with devotion, O Bestower of Boons, You are supremely auspicious. (Shiva Mahimna Stotra, 24)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MAHAKALA&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One day I said to Smashan Tara, “You are my Ma, my Mother, but who is my Father? I know the Mother always shows the child the face of its Father, so won’t You show me mine?” We have a saying in Hindi: “Only your conscience knows all your sins, and only a child’s mother knows its true father.” Without Smashan Tara I could never have succeeded at the sadhana for Her Grand Consort, Lord Shiva. Tantrikas and Aghoris work this way: First they achieve success at sadhana for Shakti and then use that Shakti to move on to the Universal Soul, Shiva.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;BOMBAY&amp;rsquo;S SUMMER USUALLY begins near the end of March. With the summer of 1977 summer came the problem of where to send Stoney to brood. Pedigrees of all sorts fascinated Vimalananda; when we watched Wimbledon together he would sigh and say, “If only Jimmy Connors and Chrissy Evert would get together, their child would really be something!!” Now he had the opportunity to select the genes that would mingle with those of his beloved Stoney. He invested more and more of his spare time in pedi gree comparisons, to ensure that the ensuing foal would bring glory to its mare&amp;rsquo;s name.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;“Both anusthanas and purashcharanas require you to follow what we call in Sanskrit the path of the Five S&amp;rsquo;s: sthana, samaya, sankhya, samagri, and samyama. The purpose of these rules is to achieve the sa-guna or mr anifested form of the deity. You know Sanskrit; translate these words.”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;&amp;lsquo;Sthana&amp;rsquo; means location.”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;So first you must stay in one location throughout the duration of your penance and not travel about. Moreover, you must sit in the same place each day, face in the same direction, and if possible sit in the same posi tion.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

This is especially true if, like an Aghori, you are in a hurry to succeed, and you decide to practice dangerous sadhanas like Panchamakara. Meat, fish, wine, parched grain and sex are all intoxicants, and the purpose of intoxicants is to stimulate your nerves to be able to withstand the force of the Kundalini Shakti.

      <title>03 WHY I AM SO CLEVER</title>

      <guid>https://vishvAsa.github.io/english/prose/nietzsche/ecce_homo/03_WHY_I_AM_SO_CLEVER/</guid>
      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;1&#34;&gt;1&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;− WHY do I know a few &lt;em&gt;more&lt;/em&gt; things? Why am I so clever altogether? I have never reflected on questions that are none − I have not squandered myself. − I have, for example, no experience of actual &lt;em&gt;religious&lt;/em&gt; difficulties. I am entirely at a loss to know to what extent I ought to have felt ‘sinful’. I likewise lack a reliable criterion of a pang of conscience: from what one &lt;em&gt;bears&lt;/em&gt; of it, a pang of conscience does not seem to me anything respectable… I should not like to leave an act in the lurch &lt;em&gt;afterwards,&lt;/em&gt; I would as a matter of principle prefer to leave the evil outcome, the &lt;em&gt;consequences,&lt;/em&gt; out of the question of values. When the outcome is evil one can easily lose the &lt;em&gt;true&lt;/em&gt; eye for what one has done: a pang of conscience seems to me a kind of ‘&lt;em&gt;evil&lt;/em&gt; eye’. To honour to oneself something that went wrong all the more &lt;em&gt;because&lt;/em&gt; it went wrong − that rather would accord with my morality. − ‘God’, ‘immortality of the soul’, ‘redemption’, ‘the Beyond’, all of them concepts to which I have given no attention and no time, not even as a child − perhaps I was never childish enough for it? − I have absolutely no knowledge of atheism as an outcome of reasoning, still less as an event: with me it is obvious by instinct. I am too inquisitive, too &lt;em&gt;questionable,&lt;/em&gt; too high spirited to rest content with a crude answer. God is a crude answer, a piece of indelicacy against us thinkers − fundamentally even a crude &lt;em&gt;prohibition&lt;/em&gt; to us: you shall not think!… I am interested in quite a different way in a question upon which the ‘salvation of mankind’ depends far more than it does upon any kind of quaint curiosity of the theologians: the question of &lt;em&gt;nutriment.&lt;/em&gt; One can for convenience’ sake formulate it thus: ‘how to nourish yourself so as to attain your maximum of strength, of &lt;em&gt;virtù&lt;/em&gt; in the Renaissance style, of moraline-free virtue?’ – My experiences here are as bad as they possibly could be; I am astonished that I heard this question so late, that I learned ‘reason’ from these experiences so late. Only the perfect worthlessness of our German education – its ‘idealism’ – can to some extent explain to me why on precisely this point I was backward to the point of holiness. This ‘education’ which from the first teaches one to lose sight of &lt;em&gt;realities&lt;/em&gt; so as to hunt after altogether problematic, so-called ‘ideal’ objectives, ‘classical education’ for example − as if it were not from the first an utterly fruitless undertaking to try to unite ‘classical’ and ‘German’ in &lt;em&gt;one&lt;/em&gt; concept! It is, moreover, mirth-provoking − just think of a ‘classically educated’ Leipziger! − Until my very maturest years I did in fact eat &lt;em&gt;badly&lt;/em&gt; − in the language of morals ‘impersonally’, ‘selflessly’, ‘altruistically’, for the salvation of cooks and other fellow Christians. With the aid of Leipzig cookery, for example, which accompanied my earliest study of Schopenhauer (1865), I very earnestly denied my ‘will to live’. To ruin one’s stomach so as to receive inadequate nutriment − the aforesaid cookery seems to me to solve this problem wonderfully well. (It is said that 1866 produced a change in this domain −.) But German cookery in general − what does it not have on its conscience! Soup &lt;em&gt;before&lt;/em&gt; the meal (in Venetian cookery books of the sixteenth century still called &lt;em&gt;alla tedesca&lt;/em&gt;); meat cooked to shreds, greasy and floury vegetables; the degeneration of puddings to paperweights! If one adds to this the downright bestial dinner-drinking habits of the ancient and by no means only the &lt;em&gt;ancient&lt;/em&gt; Germans one will also understand the origin of the &lt;em&gt;German spirit&lt;/em&gt; − disturbed intestines… The German spirit is an indigestion, it can have done with nothing. − But to the &lt;em&gt;English&lt;/em&gt; diet too, which compared with the Germans, even with the French, is a kind of ‘return to nature’, that is to say to cannibalism, my own instinct is profoundly opposed; it seems to me to give the spirit &lt;em&gt;heavy&lt;/em&gt; feet − the feet of Englishwomen… The best cookery is that of &lt;em&gt;Piedmont.&lt;/em&gt; Aleoholic drinks are no good for me; a glass of wine or beer a day is quite enough to make life for me a ‘Vale of Tears’ – Munich is where my antipodes live. Granted I was a little late to grasp this – I &lt;em&gt;experienced&lt;/em&gt; it really from childhood onwards. As a boy I believed wine-drinking to be, like tobacco-smoking, at first only a vanity of young men, later a habit. Perhaps the wine of Naumburg is in part to blame for this &lt;em&gt;austere&lt;/em&gt; judgement. To believe that wine &lt;em&gt;makes cheerful&lt;/em&gt; I would have to be a Christian, that is to say believe what is for precisely me an absurdity. Oddly enough, while I am put extremely out of sorts by &lt;em&gt;small,&lt;/em&gt; much diluted doses of alcohol, I am almost turned into a sailor when it comes to &lt;em&gt;strong&lt;/em&gt; doses. Even as a boy I showed how brave I was in this respect. To write a long Latin essay in a &lt;em&gt;single&lt;/em&gt; night’s sitting and then go on to make a fair copy of it, with the ambition in my pen to imitate in severity and concision my model Sallust, and to pour a quantity of grog of the heaviest calibre over my Latin, was even when I was a pupil of venerable Schulpforta in no way opposed to my physiology, nor perhaps to that of Sallust – however much it might have been to venerable Schulpforta… Later, towards the middle of life, I decided, to be sure, more and more strictly &lt;em&gt;against&lt;/em&gt; any sort of ‘spirituous’ drink: an opponent of vegetarianism from experience, just like Richard Wagner, who converted me, I cannot advise all &lt;em&gt;more spiritual&lt;/em&gt; natures too seriously to abstain from alcohol absolutely. &lt;em&gt;Water&lt;/em&gt; suffices… I prefer places in which there is everywhere opportunity to drink from flowing fountains (Nice, Turin, Sils); a small glass runs after me like a dog. &lt;em&gt;In vino Veritas:&lt;/em&gt; it seems that here too I am again at odds with all the world over the concept ‘truth’ − with me the spirit moves over the water… A couple more signposts from my morality. A big meal is easier to digest than one too small. That the stomach comes into action as a whole, first precondition of a good digestion. One has to &lt;em&gt;know&lt;/em&gt; the size of one’s stomach. For the same reason those tedious meals should be avoided which I call interrupted sacrificial feasts, those at the &lt;em&gt;table d’hôte.&lt;/em&gt; − No eating between meals, no coffee: coffee makes gloomy. &lt;em&gt;Tea&lt;/em&gt; beneficial only in the morning. Little, but strong: tea very detrimental and sicklying o’er the whole day if it is the slightest bit too weak. Each has here his own degree, often between the narrowest and most delicate limits. In a very &lt;em&gt;agaçant&lt;/em&gt; climate it is inadvisable to start with tea: one should start an hour earlier with a cup of thick oil-free cocoa. − &lt;em&gt;Sit&lt;/em&gt; as little as possible; credit no thought not born in the open air and while moving freely about − in which the muscles too do not hold a festival. All prejudices come from the intestines. − Assiduity − I have said it once before − the actual &lt;em&gt;sin&lt;/em&gt; against the holy spirit. −&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I backed off and returned to my cabin, deeply distressed. I barely slept the hours remaining till dawn, instead tossing and turning in my bunk, while Quell lay undisturbed, dreaming who knows what alien dreams.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;At the first bell, I rose and made my way to the communications deck. There I found crewman Small, bent over his console.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;“Do you know that a rocket feeds itself in space?” he asked.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The air was hot as the bakery wagon moved and then, as they reached the shadows of trees, the air began to cool.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The young man leaned forward.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;“How did you guess?”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;“What?” said the driver.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;“That I’m a writer,” said the young man.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The taxi driver glanced at the passing trees and nodded.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;“Your tongue improves your words on their way out.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Mankind surely does &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; represent an evolution toward a better or stronger or higher level, as progress is now understood. This “progress” is merely a modern idea, which is to say, a false idea. The European of today, in his essential worth, falls far below the European of the Renaissance; the process of evolution does &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; necessarily mean elevation, enhancement, strengthening.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;True enough, it succeeds in isolated and individual cases in various parts of the earth and under the most widely different cultures, and in these cases a &lt;em&gt;higher&lt;/em&gt; type certainly manifests itself; something which, compared to mankind in the mass, appears as a sort of superman. Such happy strokes of high success have always been possible, and will remain possible, perhaps, for all time to come. Even whole races, tribes and nations may occasionally represent such lucky accidents.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;What preserves the species.&lt;/em&gt; – The strongest and most evil spirits have so far done the most to advance humanity: time and again they rekindled the dozing passions – every ordered society puts the passions to sleep –, time and again they reawakened the sense of comparison, of contradiction, of delight in what is new, daring, unattempted; they forced men to pit opinion against opinion, ideal model against ideal model. Mostly by force of arms, by toppling boundary stones, by violating pieties – but also by means of new religions and moralities! In every teacher and preacher of what is new we find the same ‘mischief’ that makes conquerors infamous, even if its expression is subtler and does not instantly set the muscles in motion and for just that reason does not make one as infamous! What is new, however, is under all circumstances &lt;em&gt;evil,&lt;/em&gt; being that which wants to conquer, to overthrow the old boundary stones and pieties; and only what is old is good! In every age the good men are those who bury the old thoughts deeply and make them bear fruit – the farmers of the spirit. But that land is eventually exhausted, and the ploughshare of evil must come time and again. Nowadays there is a thoroughly erroneous moral theory which is celebrated especially in England: it claims that judgements of ‘good’ and ‘evil’ sum up experiences of what is ‘expedient’ and ‘inexpedient’; that what is called good preserves the species while what is called evil harms it. In truth, however, the evil drives are just as expedient, species-preserving, and indispensable as the good ones – they just have a different function.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;“But I know you have said before that you don&amp;rsquo;t have to renounce every thing in order to achieve.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;“No, you don&amp;rsquo;t; but you do have to make everything into a sadhana. Offer every morsel of food to your deity; go to sleep at night remembering your deity. And as for sex, you don&amp;rsquo;t need to know any complicated sexual rituals in order to offer a mantra with each stroke of the penis into the fire of the vagina. Always offer whatever you do to your deity, and He or she will always take care of you. However, how easy is it to remember to offer a man tra with each stroke of your penis once your sexual embrace becomes really intense? This is why I say that the more potential addictions you remove the faster will be your progress.”&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Chapter 4&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;EARLY YEARS AT OXFORD&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Max Muller came to Oxford in 1848, just in time to see the last years of the old, Laudian, Tory university, in which the part that was formally the university was a pool and almost unwanted relation of the colleges The year 1854, which saw the Oxford University Act become law on August 7, was as great a landmark in the academic history of Oxford as 1832 (the year of the first Reform Act) was in the political history of the British people Old Oxford did not disappear at once, but a process of transformation was set in motion, to continue for at least three decades until a new Oxford took a stable form&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Aghora, described in this volume as “super-tantra,” is a Path of Devotion to the Great Mother Goddess Kundalini, here manifesting with the Name and Image of the Goddess Tara. This Way is one of extraordinary extremes and intensities, even for tantra, and its aim is nothing less than to destroy the human limitations of the practitioner, so that he or she becomes a super human&amp;ndash;in fact, a kind of deity.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The standard biography of Nietzsche in English is R. J. Hollingdale, &lt;em&gt;Nietzsche: The Man and his Philosophy,&lt;/em&gt; recently published in a revised and updated second edition (Cambridge University Press, 1999). Lesley Chamberlain’s &lt;em&gt;Nietzsche in Turin: An Intimate Biography&lt;/em&gt; (Picador, 1997) gives a vivid picture of his life in the period during which he was at work on &lt;em&gt;The Gay Science.&lt;/em&gt; There are two excellent general introductions to Nietzsche’s philosophy, a short book by Michael Tanner, &lt;em&gt;Nietzsche&lt;/em&gt; (Oxford University Press, 1995) and a slightly longer and more technical book by Henry Staten, &lt;em&gt;Nietzsche’s Voice&lt;/em&gt; (Cornell University Press, 1990). Readers interested in Nietzsche’s epistemology and metaphysics should consult Maudemarie Clark’s &lt;em&gt;Nietzsche on Truth and Philosophy&lt;/em&gt; (Cambridge University Press, 1991), John T. Wilcox, &lt;em&gt;Truth and Value in Nietzsche: A Study of his Metaethics and Epistemology&lt;/em&gt; (University of Michigan Press, 1974), and Ken Gemes, ‘Nietzsche’s Critique of Truth’, &lt;em&gt;Philosophy and Phenomenological Research,&lt;/em&gt; 52 (1992), 47–66. Those with an interest in Nietzsche’s moral philosophy should consult Alexander Nehamas, &lt;em&gt;Nietzsche: Life as Literature&lt;/em&gt; (Harvard University Press, 1987). There are two recent helpful discussions of Nietzsche’s political and social thought: Bruce Detwiler, &lt;em&gt;Nietzsche and the Politics of Aristocratic Radicalism&lt;/em&gt; (University of Chicago Press, 1990) and Mark Warren, &lt;em&gt;Nietzsche and Political Thought&lt;/em&gt; (MIT Press, 1988). See also Peter Bergmann, &lt;em&gt;Nietzsche, ‘the Last Unpolitical German’&lt;/em&gt; (Indiana University Press, 1987). For an interesting discussion of some aspects of Nietzsche’s legacy, see Steven E. Ascheim, &lt;em&gt;The Nietzsche Legacy in Germany 1890–1990&lt;/em&gt; (University of California Press, 1992).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Vimalananda delivered the next in this series of musings at a Ganesha temple. I can no longer recall which temple it was, for he was very fond of Ganesha and we paid regular visits to several images of the elephant-headed god. The area around Poona has been associated with Ganesha worship for centuries, and Ganesha is still one of the most beloved of deities of that region.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;After we had finished our worship and were relaxing, he began to address me thus:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Chapter 4&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;OXFORD-DARK AND BRIGHT&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;By the time Max Muller, as Taylorian Professor, had become an associate member, so to speak, of the academic club of Oxford — the date being February 1854 — the university had ceased to be the happy convent it was even in 1848 The Pax Oxomana was shattered at one stroke by the appointment of the Royal Commission of 1850 As Mark Pattison said, if a man had fallen asleep in 1846 and woken up again in 1850 he would have found himself in a different world It was tom into two factions, the opponents and the supporters of reform The old guard was in power, and feeling ran so high against the renegades that one of them asked a junior professor to invite him to dinner because the heads of colleges would no longer admit him to their table Actually, the Commission made a difference to the social habits of Oxford Before its appointment there were hardly any private dinners besides those in the halls But the Commission broke up the academic society into sets, and private dinners had to keep up the social life of those who were excluded from the high table on account of their support for reform&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Vimalananda lit yet another cigarette. &amp;ldquo;Nothing is ever lost in the universe. Even things which happened mil lions of years ago can still be known, because their sound still exists. Sound, which is vibration, a series of waves, can be transmitted in many ways. Light can carry sound; even modern science has proved this. Humans usually perceive sound via molecules of air that vibrate; in light something else vibrates, but sound is there within light all the same. It may be in a form subtler than the ear can hear, but it is there nonetheless, and anyone who has access to subtle sounds can hear it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Some days later when I was in Bombay I accompanied Vimalananda on an uneventful visit to K., one of his old friends. Afterward I noticed that Vim alananda was quieter than usual, so after we reached home and had tea I casually asked him, &amp;ldquo;Have you known that gentleman for very long?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;| 148 1&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;MANTRA&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;He replied, “There are many restrictions to follow if you really want to perfect a mantra. One of the most important is that you must never tell any one which mantra you repeat. When you tell someone else your mantra you allow them access to the Shakti you are trying to accumulate, which is tan tamount to giving them a blank check and asking them to clean out your bank account. Anyone who needs to know your mantra will be able to find out without asking you; whoever cannot find it out without asking does not need to know&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;“Most people will tell you there are six chakras. An Aghori will tell you there are nine. To understand this statement you must at least know the dif ference between a nara (man) and a khara (donkey). If you think this is a joking matter, it is because you are a khara yourself.”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I had grinned at the comparison, and now I grinned at his affront. He snorted and went on.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;IN EARLY 1978 I was introduced to Vimalananda&amp;rsquo;s newest horse, a hand some compact colt named Timir, when I watched him win his first race. This occasion was also noteworthy for me—it was the first time I had been able to cheer home one of Vimalananda&amp;rsquo;s horses..and I found winning to be as electrifying a feeling as he had promised it would be. For the first time I un derstood the seduction of that sensation, how for sporting types like Vima lananda each victory could be as thrilling as his first.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>04 WHY I WRITE SUCH GOOD BOOKS</title>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;1&#34;&gt;1&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I AM one thing, my writings are another. – Here, before I speak of these writings themselves, I shall touch on the question of their being understood or &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; understood. I shall do so as perfunctorily as is fitting: for the time for this question has certainly not yet come. My time has not yet come, some are born posthumously. – One day or other institutions will be needed in which people live and teach as I understand living and teaching: perhaps even chairs for the interpretation of Zarathustra will be established. But it would be a complete contradiction of myself if I expected ears &lt;em&gt;and hands&lt;/em&gt; for &lt;em&gt;my&lt;/em&gt; truths already today: that I am not heard today, that no one today knows how to take from me, is not only comprehensible; it even seems to me right. I do not want to be taken for what I am not – and that requires that I do not take myself for what I am not. To say it again, little of ‘ill will’ can be shown in my life; neither would I be able to speak of barely a single case of ‘literary ill will’. On the other hand all too much of &lt;em&gt;pure folly&lt;/em&gt;!… It seems to me that to take a book of mine into his hands is one of the rarest distinctions anyone can confer upon himself – I even assume he removes his shoes when he does so – not to speak of boots… When Doctor Heinrich von Stein once honestly complained that he understood not one word of my Zarathustra, I told him that was quite in order: to have understood, that is to say &lt;em&gt;experienced&lt;/em&gt;, six sentences of that book would raise one to a higher level of mortals than ‘modern’ man could attain to. How &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; I, with &lt;em&gt;this&lt;/em&gt; feeling of distance, even want the ‘modern men’ I know – to read me! – My triumph is precisely the opposite of Schopenhauer’s – I say ‘non &lt;em&gt;legor&lt;/em&gt;, non &lt;em&gt;legar&lt;/em&gt;’. – Not that I should like to underestimate the pleasure which the &lt;em&gt;innocence&lt;/em&gt; in the rejection of my writings has given me. This very summer just gone, at a time when, with my own weighty, too heavily weighty literature, I was perhaps throwing all the rest of literature off its balance, a professor of Berlin University kindly gave me to understand that I ought really to avail myself of a different form: no one read stuff like mine. – In the end it was not Germany but Switzerland which offered me the two extreme cases. An essay of Dr V. Widmann in the &lt;em&gt;Bund&lt;/em&gt; on ‘Beyond Good and Evil’ under the title ‘Nietzsche’s Dangerous Book’, and a general report on my books as a whole on the part of Herr Karl Spitteler, also in the &lt;em&gt;Bund,&lt;/em&gt; constitute a maximum in my life – of what I take care not to say… The latter, for example, dealt with my Zarathustra as an &lt;em&gt;advanced exercise in style&lt;/em&gt;, with the request that I might later try to provide some content; Dr Widmann expressed his respect for the courage with which I strive to abolish all decent feelings. – Through a little trick of chance every sentence here was, with a consistency I had to admire, a truth stood on its head: remarkably enough, all one had to do was to ‘revalue all values’ in order to hit the nail on the head with regard to me – instead of hitting my head with a nail… All the more reason for me to attempt an explanation. – Ultimately, no one can extract from things, books included, more than he already knows. What one has no access to through experience one has no ear for. Now let us imagine an extreme case: that a book speaks of nothing but events which lie outside the possibility of general or even of rare experience – that it is the &lt;em&gt;first&lt;/em&gt; language for a new range of experiences. In this case simply nothing will be heard, with the acoustical illusion that where nothing is heard there &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; nothing… This is in fact my average experience and, if you like, the &lt;em&gt;originality&lt;/em&gt; of my experience. Whoever believed he had understood something of me had dressed up something out of me after his own image – not uncommonly an antithesis of me, for instance an ‘idealist’; whoever had understood nothing of me denied that I came into consideration at all. – The word ‘superman’ to designate a type that has turned out supremely well, in antithesis to ‘modern’ men, to ‘good’ men, to Christians and other nihilists – a word which, in the mouth of a Zarathustra, the &lt;em&gt;destroyer&lt;/em&gt; of morality, becomes a very thoughtful word – has almost everywhere been understood with perfect innocence in the sense of those values whose antithesis makes its appearance in the figure of Zarathustra: that is to say as an ‘idealistic’ type of higher species of man, half ‘saint’, half ‘genius’… Other learned cattle caused me on its account to be suspected of Darwinism; even the ‘hero cult’ of that great unconscious and involuntary counterfeiter Carlyle which I rejected so maliciously has been recognized in it. He into whose ear I whispered he ought to look around rather for a Cesare Borgia than for a Parsifal did not believe his ears. – That I am utterly incurious about discussions of my books, especially by newspapers, will have to be forgiven me. My friends, my publishers know this and do not speak to me about such things. In a particular instance I once had a sight of all the sins that had been committed against a single book – it was ‘Beyond Good and Evil’; I could tell a pretty story about that. Would you believe it that the ‘Nationalzeitung’ – a Prussian newspaper, for my foreign readers – I myself read, if I may say so, only the Journal des Débats – could in all seriousness understand the book as a ‘sign of the times’, as the real genuine &lt;em&gt;Junker philosophy&lt;/em&gt; for which the ‘Kreuzzeitung’ merely lacked the courage?…&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;From Small’s console came dim voices, cloaked in static, from untold miles away: “&lt;em&gt;Lightfall 1&lt;/em&gt; calling &lt;em&gt;Cetus 7. Lightfall&lt;/em&gt; here. Inbound from twelve years out. &lt;em&gt;Cetus 7,&lt;/em&gt; do you read?”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;My God, I thought, another spacecraft.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Quell’s voice touched my thoughts. “Impossible. In all these billions of miles of space. What are the chances of meeting—”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;“Another spaceship?” I asked aloud.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;“This is &lt;em&gt;Lightfall 1,&lt;/em&gt;” came the voice again. “Shall we hang fire, &lt;em&gt;Cetus 7&lt;/em&gt;?”&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;At which moment an old-fashioned ice wagon with a full dark cavern mouth of frost entered the yard, led by a horse in dire need of his Antarctic cargo. Cardiff could taste the ice, from thirty summers long gone.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;“Just in time,” said the iceman. “Hot day. Go grab.” He nodded toward the rear of his wagon.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Cardiff, on pure instinct, jumped down from the bread wagon and went straight to the back of the ice wagon, and felt his ten-year-old hand reach in and grab a sharp icicle. He stepped back and rubbed it on his brow. His other hand instinctively took a handkerchief from his pocket to wrap the ice. Sucking it, he moved away.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;We should not deck out and embellish Christianity: it has waged a war to the death against this &lt;em&gt;higher&lt;/em&gt; type of man, it has put all the deepest instincts of this type under its ban, it has developed its concept of evil, of the Evil One himself, out of these instincts—the strong man as the typical reprobate, the “outcast among men.” Christianity has taken the part of all the weak, the low, the botched; it has made an ideal out of &lt;em&gt;antagonism&lt;/em&gt; to all the self-preservative instincts of sound life; it has corrupted even the faculties of those natures that are intellectually most vigorous, by representing the highest intellectual values as sinful, as misleading, as full of temptation. The most lamentable example: the corruption of Pascal, who believed that his intellect had been destroyed by original sin, whereas it was actually destroyed by Christianity!—&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Unconditional duties.&lt;/em&gt; – All persons who feel that they need the strongest words and sounds, the most eloquent gestures and postures, in order to be effective &lt;em&gt;at all&lt;/em&gt; – revolutionary politicians, socialists, preachers of repentance with or without Christianity, all of whom refuse to accept semi-successes: they all speak of ‘duties’, and indeed always of duties with an unconditional character – without such duties they would have no right to their great pathos; they know that quite well! So they reach for moral philosophies that preach some categorical imperative, or they ingest a goodly piece of religion, as Mazzini4 did, for example. Because they want the unconditional confidence of others, they first need unconditional confidence in themselves on the basis of some ultimate, indisputable and inherently sublime commandment, and they want to feel like and pass themselves off as its servants and instruments. Here we have the most natural and usually very influential opponents of moral enlightenment and scepticism; but they are rare. On the other hand, a very comprehensive class of these opponents can be found wherever self-interest teaches submission while reputation and honour seem to prohibit it. Whoever feels his dignity violated by the thought of being the &lt;em&gt;instrument&lt;/em&gt; of a prince or party or sect or even a financial power – say, as the descendant of an old, proud family – but still wants to or must be this instrument before himself and before the public, needs poignant principles that can be mouthed any time, principles of an unconditional ‘ought’ to which one may openly submit and be seen to have submitted without shame. All refined servility clings to the categorical imperative and is the mortal enemy of those who want to deprive duty of its unconditional character: that is what decency demands of them, and not only decency.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This book is a biography, that is to say, an account of the life of a man who was a scholar and a thinker, it is not except incidentally a discussion or evaluation of his work in the fields of knowledge with which his scholarship was concerned But a biography should not be inflicted on a reading public without proper justification, I do not think that a man is entitled to such treatment only on the strength of his position and fame in his own age, unless in addition he played so important and significant a role in history that he remains an element to be reckoned with in understanding the continuing evolution of a particular people or humanity in general; nor unless his personality and activities belong to a type whose presence and functiomng is continuous and umversal, so that no outstanding individual of the type ever loses his relevance to all ages&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;“The study of philosophy without a longing for liberation is like dressing up a corpse.&amp;quot;— Tripura Rahasya&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In earlier times, when esoteric knowledge was under jealous guard, a spir itual aspirant usually had to endure years of patient waiting before being taught. Now that information has become an article of commerce, all man ner of secrets would seem to have become available to anyone who has the price of a book or tape; however, simply because secret doctrines can now be purchased and thus easily possessed does not mean they can be easily comprehended. Though words can be bought and sold, that living wisdom which cannot be confined within words must still be earned.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nature is very kind to me; in fact, as my friend Faram used to say, Nature is cockeyed to me. And that is because of my mentors. My mentors were very good. That’s all I can say; my mentors were very good. Maybe it’s true I was meant by Nature to succeed at all my sadhanas, but my mentors triggered me up and made me succeed. They were too good.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I could see that mantras were really very useful things. “Telling your mantra to someone else is fatal, but there are other mistakes which can also ruin you. Mispronunciation is one of the worst. The way a word is pronounced has a lot to do with its meaning. For instance, when you come in and I say, &amp;lsquo;Hello, Robby, how are you?&amp;rsquo; with a pleasant voice and a smiling face, how do you feel?”&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I had to shake my head in appreciation and agreement, it was so true.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;“To make Kundalini rise from the tip of the spine you must create enough pressure to force Her out of the Muladhara Chakra. The upward motion will continue only so long as the pressure remains; without it Kundalini drops back down to the bottom, due to gravity. Because humans stand erect, grav ity acts only on the tip of the spinal cord, not on the whole thing as it does in other animals, whose spines are horizontal or nearly so. This is one rea son why it is easier to awaken Kundalini in a human than in an animal.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;STONEY FAILED TO GET into foal at Vitu Karve&amp;rsquo;s stud farm even in early 1978, due at least in part to Vitu&amp;rsquo;s unwillingness to spend much money on her feed. Vimalananda soon decided to send her elsewhere, but where? All the other stud farms insisted on seeing the color of his coin. When things seemed bleakest Nature stepped in, as She usually did for Vimalananda in a pinch. This time She arrived in the form of Mr. Gokuldas Madhavdas, a friendly industrialist and race horse owner growling his way through life. Gokuldas, who to my eye most resembled a mature and knowledgeable frog, was introduced to Vimalananda by Gokuldas&amp;rsquo;s shy niece Prabha, who brought her angelic voice to Vimalananda for training on a regular basis. On hearing of Stoney&amp;rsquo;s dilemma Gokuldas insisted on attempting to prevail on Erach Ghasvala, a dapper Parsi who owned a stud in the South, to accept Stoney into his farm on favorable terms. This was a boon in itself, but the ic ing on the cake—in Hindi we say &amp;ldquo;the fragrance on the gold”—was that Scar let Ruby stood in Erach&amp;rsquo;s yard.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>05 THE BIRTH OF TRAGEDY</title>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;1&#34;&gt;1&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;IN order to be just to ‘The Birth of Tragedy’ (1872) one will have to forget a few things. It made its &lt;em&gt;effect&lt;/em&gt; and even exercised fascination through what was wrong with it − through its application to &lt;em&gt;Wagnerism,&lt;/em&gt; as if this were a symptom of a &lt;em&gt;beginning.&lt;/em&gt; That is what made this book an event in Wagner’s life: it was only from then on that great hopes surrounded the name Wagner. Even today people remind me, sometimes in the middle of Parsifal, that it is really I who have it on my conscience that so high an opinion of the &lt;em&gt;cultural value&lt;/em&gt; of this movement has come to predominate. − I have often found the book cited as ‘the Rebirth of Tragedy out of the Spirit of Music’: people have had ears only for a new formula for the art, the intention, the task of &lt;em&gt;Wagner −&lt;/em&gt; what of value was concealed in the book was thereby not listened to. ‘Hellenism and Pessimism’: that would have been a less ambiguous tide: that is to say as a first instruction in how the Greeks got rid of pessimism − with what they &lt;em&gt;overcame&lt;/em&gt; it… Precisely tragedy is the proof that the Greeks were &lt;em&gt;no&lt;/em&gt; pessimists: Schopenhauer blundered in this as he blundered in everything. − Taken up and viewed impartially, ‘The Birth of Tragedy’ looks very untimely: one would not dream it was &lt;em&gt;begun&lt;/em&gt; amid the thunders of the battle of Wörth. I thought these problems through before the walls of Metz, in cold September nights while serving in the medical corps; one would rather believe the book to be fifty years older. It is politically indifferent − ‘un-German’ one would say today − it smells offensively Hegelian, it is in only a few formulas infected with the cadaverous perfume of Schopenhauer. An ‘idea’ − the antithesis Dionysian and Apollonian − translated into the metaphysical; history itself as the evolution of this ‘idea’; in tragedy this antithesis elevated to a unity; from this perspective things which had never before caught sight of one another suddenly confronted with one another, illuminated by one another and &lt;em&gt;comprehended…&lt;/em&gt; for example opera and revolution… The book’s two decisive &lt;em&gt;novelties&lt;/em&gt; are, firstly the understanding of the &lt;em&gt;dionysian&lt;/em&gt; phenomenon in the case of the Greeks − it offers the first psychology of this phenomenon, it sees in it the sole root of the whole of Hellenic art − The other novelty is the understanding of Socratism: Socrates for the first time recognized as an agent of Hellenic disintegration, as a typical &lt;em&gt;décadent.&lt;/em&gt; ‘Rationality’ &lt;em&gt;against&lt;/em&gt; instinct. ‘Rationality’ at any price as dangerous, as a force undermining life! − A profound hostile silence with regard to Christianity throughout the book. Christianity is neither Apollonian nor Dionysian, it &lt;em&gt;negates&lt;/em&gt; all &lt;em&gt;aesthetic&lt;/em&gt; values − the only values ‘The Birth of Tragedy’ recognizes: it is in the profoundest sense nihilistic, while in the Dionysian symbol there is attained the extreme limit of &lt;em&gt;affirmation.&lt;/em&gt; In one place the Christian priests are alluded to as a ‘malicious species of dwarfs’, as ‘subterraneans’…&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;During the afternoons Vimalananda&amp;rsquo;s conversation usually revolved around the racecourse, since most of the people who dropped by to see him at that time were interested in the hot tips which are the sustenance of those who gamble on horses. Those who were more interested in hearing him dis cuss spirituality would come in the evenings, when he would relax and let his mind focus on Reality. One night, after overhearing a couple of his spiri tual “children&amp;quot; speaking knowingly of “devotion” and “knowledge,” he felt a need to put the record straight:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;It is a problem only because you lack patience. If you decide that locat ing a Rishi is the thing you want most to do you will set about doing it, no matter how many lifetimes it may take. It is only a matter of time, after all.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;“Being immortal the Rishis are not subject to time as we know it. They have gone beyond the reach of Mahakala, the God of Death, whose name is Time. Mahakala is the center of all the universes, the boundary between form and formlessness. Death provides limitation to form with the help of time. All of us who are born are destined to die, and as long as we live all of us exist within the stream of time. Once we die we drop out of time until we are reborn&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;To the realists.&lt;/em&gt; – You sober people who feel armed against passion and phantastical conceptions and would like to make your emptiness a matter of pride and an ornament – you call yourself realists and insinuate that the world really is the way it appears to you: before you alone reality stands unveiled, and you yourselves are perhaps the best part of it – oh, you beloved images of Sais!1 But aren’t you too in your unveiled condition still most passionate and dark creatures, compared to fish, and still all too similar to an artist in love? And what is ‘reality’ to an artist in love! You still carry around the valuations of things that originate in the passions and loves of former centuries! Your sobriety still contains a secret and inextirpable drunkenness! Your love of ‘reality’, for example – oh, that is an old, ancient ‘love’! In every experience, in every sense impression there is a piece of this old love; and some fantasy, some prejudice, some irrationality, some ignorance, some fear, and whatever else, has worked on and contributed to it. That mountain over there! That cloud over there! What is ‘real’ about that? Subtract just once the phantasm and the whole human &lt;em&gt;contribution&lt;/em&gt; from it, you sober ones! Yes, if you could do &lt;em&gt;that!&lt;/em&gt; If you could forget your background, your past, your nursery school – all of your humanity and animality! There is no ‘reality’ for us – and not for you either, you sober ones – we are not nearly as strange to one another as you think, and perhaps our good will to transcend drunkenness is just as respectable as your belief that you are altogether &lt;em&gt;incapable&lt;/em&gt; of drunkenness.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Only as creators!&lt;/em&gt; – This has caused me the greatest trouble and still does always cause me the greatest trouble: to realize that &lt;em&gt;what things are called&lt;/em&gt; is unspeakably more important than what they are. The reputation, name, and appearance, the worth, the usual measure and weight of a thing – originally almost always something mistaken and arbitrary, thrown over things like a dress and quite foreign to their nature and even to their skin – has, through the belief in it and its growth from generation to generation, slowly grown onto and into the thing and has become its very body: what started as appearance in the end nearly always becomes essence and &lt;em&gt;effectively acts&lt;/em&gt; as its essence! What kind of a fool would believe that it is enough to point to this origin and this misty shroud of delusion in order to &lt;em&gt;destroy&lt;/em&gt; the world that counts as ‘real’, so-called ‘reality’! Only as creators can we destroy! – But let us also not forget that in the long run it is enough to create new names and valuations and appearances of truth in order to create new ‘things’.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;We artists.&lt;/em&gt; – When we love a woman, we easily come to hate nature because of all the repulsive natural functions to which every woman is subject; we prefer not to think about it at all, but when our soul for once brushes against these matters, it shrugs impatiently and, as just said, casts a contemptuous look at nature: we feel insulted; nature seems to intrude on our property and with the most profane hands at that. In cases like this one refuses to hear anything about physiology and decrees secretly to oneself, ‘I will hear nothing of the idea that the human being is anything other than soul and form!’ ‘The human being under the skin’ is an abomination and unthinkable to all lovers, a blasphemy against God and love. Now, the way lovers still feel about nature and naturalness is how every worshipper of God and his ‘holy omnipotence’ formerly felt: in everything that was said about nature by astronomers, geologists, physiologists, and doctors, he saw an intrusion on his choicest property and thus an attack – and a shameless one at that! Even the ‘law of nature’ sounded to him like a slander against God; he would basically much rather have seen all of mechanics traced back to moral acts of will and choice – but since no one could do him that service, he &lt;em&gt;concealed&lt;/em&gt; nature and mechanics from himself as best he could and lived in a dream. Oh, these people of former times knew how to &lt;em&gt;dream,&lt;/em&gt; and didn’t even need to fall asleep first! – and we men of today also still know it all too well, despite all our good will towards waking and the day! We need only to love, to hate, to desire, simply to feel – &lt;em&gt;at once&lt;/em&gt; the spirit and power of the dream comes over us, and we climb with open eyes, impervious to all danger, up the most dangerous paths, onto the roofs and towers of fantasy, and without any vertigo, as though born to climb – we sleepwalkers of the day! We artists! We who conceal naturalness! We who are moon- and God-struck! We untiring wanderers, silent as death, on heights that we see not as heights but as our plains, as our safety.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Deep in the false night, our captain walked along the sleeping quarter corridors. Quell scanned his mind and spoke his words to me in whispers: “‘What, pretending at sleep? Do that, and bite your bitter tongues, which hate me for spoiled games. But if Christ Himself walked through space this night—’”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;And Quell, speaking in his own voice, added: “Not Christ. But one of His lost shepherds.”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The next morning, Redleigh summoned Quell and me to Small’s communication console. There we met crewman Downs.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;James Cardiff stood in quiet amazement.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The front porch of the Egyptian View Arms was the longest he had ever seen. It had so many white wicker rockers he stopped counting. Occupying some of the rockers was an assortment of youngish not quite middle-aged gentlemen, nattily dressed, with slicked-back hair, fresh out of the shower. And interspersed among the men were late-thirties-not-yet-forty women in summer dresses looking as if they had all been cut from the same rose or orchid or gardenia wallpaper. The men had haircuts each sheared by the same barber. The women wore their tresses like bright helmets designed by some Parisian, ironed and curlicued long before Cardiff had been born. And the assembly of rockers all tilted forward and then back, in unison, in a quiet surf, as if the same ocean breeze moved them all, soundless and serene.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It is a painful and tragic spectacle that rises before me: I have drawn back the curtain from the &lt;em&gt;rottenness&lt;/em&gt; of man. This word, in my mouth, is at least free from one suspicion: that it involves a moral accusation against humanity. It is used—and I wish to emphasize the fact again—without any moral significance: and this is so far true that the rottenness I speak of is most apparent to me precisely in those quarters where there has been most aspiration, hitherto, toward “virtue” and “godliness.” As you probably surmise, I understand rottenness in the sense of &lt;em&gt;décadence&lt;/em&gt;: my argument is that all the values on which mankind now fixes its highest aspirations are &lt;em&gt;décadence&lt;/em&gt;-values.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Loss of dignity.&lt;/em&gt; – Reflection has lost all its dignity of form: we have made a laughing-stock of the ceremony and solemn gestures of reflection, and couldn’t stand an old-style wise man. We think too fast, while on our way somewhere, while walking or in the midst of all sorts of business, even when thinking of the most serious things; we need little preparation, not even much silence: it is as if we carried around in our heads an unstoppable machine that keeps working even under the most unfavourable circumstances. Formerly, one could tell just by looking at a person that he wanted to think – it was probably a rare occurrence! –, that he now wanted to become wiser and was preparing himself for a thought: one would set one’s face as for prayer and stop walking; yes, one stood still for hours on the street once the thought ‘arrived’ – on one or two legs. The dignity of the matter required it!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;When I look at someone I don’t see them as they are now; I see them as they will be. Then I can try to change them if there is something in them I think I can change. If I love skin and bones how will I be able to help them? Skin and bones will only decay, but the individual will continue to exist even after death. That is why I can say that I love people not for their present value but for their future value; not for what they are but for what they will become, or for what they have the potential to become. This is an Aghori’s love.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

What about Anasuya, the wife of the Rishi Atri? Her very name means &amp;lsquo;absence of envy.&amp;rsquo; What more could one want in a wife? And just as she was without envy, everyone was envious of her. Even Lakshmi, Sarasvati and Parvati, the wives of Vishnu, Brahma and Shiva, became envious of her, and one day they got together and decided to tell their husbands to go and disturb her penance so she would not stand out as the example of what a wife should be. Being henpecked, Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva gave in to their wives, and decided to disturb Anasuya&amp;rsquo;s penance.”&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Of course the Rishis and their disciples knew how to pronounce Sanskrit properly.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;“Yes they did, and they knew other things as well, including how to best make use of all four levels of speech.&amp;quot; As I racked my brain for any informa tion I might have collected on that subject, he continued. “You know, speech is not a product of the mind; speech is an independent creative fac ulty, a sense which operates through the mind. Kundalini is the power of an individual&amp;rsquo;s self-expression, which means that speech is simply the verbal expression of Kundalini. This is why the lotuses of the chakras have Bija Mantras for petals, and why mantras are so important for awakening Kun dalini.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Some people, though, still try to perform sadhanas that were more appropriate for Satya Yuga. There are many people who claim to repeat the Gayatri Mantra, and claim to obtain all manner of believable and unbelievable benefits from it. They babble on about how &amp;lsquo;A man who achieves success with the Gayatri Mantra attains to supreme realization, and whatnot. But do they know that the mantra that they are reciting as Gayatri is not really the Gayatri Mantra? And that the form which they visualize as they do their japa (repetition of mantra) is not the real form of Gayatri?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I have always said that life is a memory. There are actually two types of memory: conscious and unconscious. The conscious memory is very fickle and inconstant; it is directed outwards towards mundane objects, which are temporary and transitory but seem eternal to the ignorant mind. The unconscious memory is permanent; it has been collecting all your karmas from tens of millions of births without any lapse or distortion. So the uncon scious memory is actually conscious, since it perfectly records everything that happens to you, and the conscious memory is actually unconscious. People say, &amp;lsquo;I did it because of the force of circumstance,&amp;rsquo; when what they mean is that they were not conscious enough to remember not to yield to&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;AS BOMBAY&amp;rsquo;S IMPORTANCE in my life accelerated I increasingly under stood why Vimalananda had had to leave his life of many years as a itinerant sadhu and resettle in his hometown. Bombay was so crowded for him with tangled heaps of rnanubandhanas that nothing less than physical residence there would suffice for their unravelling. People daily arrived at his doorstep to confront him with shopping lists of cravings to be satisfied, but few of these solicitants showed any concern for him or his condition. Most were lit tle more than embodied karmic debts who were striving to entrap him, and few of this group appreciated interference from his own Jaya and Vijaya (Roshni and me). Fortunately none of them possessed the power of the San atkumaras, or their curses would have kept Vimalananda busy preventing his doorkeepers from falling deep into Patala. Roshni&amp;rsquo;s strategies and protocols may have differed from mine but our ends were the same: to preserve as much as possible of Vimalananda&amp;rsquo;s energy from being suckled from him by these smarmy vampires and to keep conditions in the flat from going com pletely cattywampus.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

In &lt;em&gt;Ecce Homo&lt;/em&gt; Nietzsche writes that he has used the term &lt;em&gt;gaya scienza&lt;/em&gt; here to designate the specific unity of ‘singer, knight, and free spirit’ which was characteristic of early Provencal culture.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;1&#34;&gt;1&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;THE four &lt;em&gt;untimely essays&lt;/em&gt; are altogether warlike. They demonstrate that I was no ‘Jack o’ Dreams’, that I derive pleasure from drawing the sword − also, perhaps, that I have a dangerously supple wrist. The &lt;em&gt;first&lt;/em&gt; attack (1873) was on German culture, which even at that time I already looked down on with remorseless contempt. Without meaning, without substance, without aim: a mere ‘public opinion’. There is no more vicious misunderstanding than to believe that the Germans’ great success in arms could demonstrate anything in favour of this culture − not to speak of &lt;em&gt;its&lt;/em&gt; victory over France… The &lt;em&gt;second&lt;/em&gt; untimely essay (1874) brings to light what is dangerous, what gnaws at and poisons life, in our way of carrying on science −: life &lt;em&gt;sick&lt;/em&gt; with this inhuman clockwork and mechanism, with the ‘&lt;em&gt;im&lt;/em&gt;personality’ of the worker, with the false economy of ‘division of labour’. The &lt;em&gt;goal&lt;/em&gt; gets lost, culture − the means, the modern way of carrying on science, &lt;em&gt;barbarized&lt;/em&gt;… In this essay the ‘historical sense’ of which this century is so proud is recognized for the first time as a sickness, as a typical sign of decay. − In the &lt;em&gt;third&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;fourth&lt;/em&gt; untimely essays two pictures of the sternest &lt;em&gt;selfishness, self-discipline&lt;/em&gt; are erected against this, as signposts to a &lt;em&gt;higher&lt;/em&gt; concept of culture, to the restoration of the concept ‘culture’: untimely types &lt;em&gt;par excellence,&lt;/em&gt; full of sovereign contempt for all that around them which was called ‘Reich’, ‘culture’, ‘Christianity’, ‘Bismarck’, ‘success’ − Schopenhauer and Wagner &lt;em&gt;or,&lt;/em&gt; in &lt;em&gt;one&lt;/em&gt; word, Nietzsche…&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Women and their action at a distance.&lt;/em&gt; – Do I still have ears? Am I all ear and nothing else? Here I stand amidst the fire of the surf, whose white flames are licking at my feet: from all sides it is howling, threatening, screaming, shrieking at me, while the old earth-rattler2 sings his aria in the lowest of depths, deep as a roaring bull, while pounding such an earth-rattling beat that the hearts of even these weather-beaten monsters of the rocks are trembling in their bodies. Suddenly, as if born out of nothingness, there appears before the gate of this hellish labyrinth only a few fathoms away a large sailing ship, gliding along as silently as a ghost. Oh, this ghostly beauty! How magically it touches me! What? Has all the calm and silence of the world embarked here? Is my happiness itself sitting in this quiet place – my happier self, my second, immortalized self?3 Not yet to be dead, but also no longer alive? As a spiritlike, silent, watching, gliding, hovering intermediate being? As though I were that ship that moves over the dark sea with its white sails like an enormous butterfly! Yes! To move &lt;em&gt;over&lt;/em&gt; existence! That’s it! That would be it! – It seems as though the noise here has made me into a dreamer? All great noise makes us place happiness in silence and distance. When a man stands in the midst of &lt;em&gt;his own&lt;/em&gt; noise, in the midst of his own surf of projects and plans, he is also likely to see gliding past him silent, magical creatures whose happiness and seclusion he yearns for – &lt;em&gt;women.&lt;/em&gt; He almost believes that his better self lives there amongst the women: in these quiet regions even the loudest surf turns into deathly silence and life itself into a dream about life. Yet! Yet! My noble enthusiast, even on the most beautiful sailing ship there is so much sound and noise, and unfortunately so much small, petty noise! The magic and the most powerful effect of women is, to speak the language of the philosophers, action at a distance, *actio in distans:*4 but that requires, first and foremost – &lt;em&gt;distance!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;In honour of friendship.&lt;/em&gt; – That the feeling of friendship was in antiquity considered the highest feeling, even higher than the most celebrated pride of the self-sufficient sage, indeed, as it were, as its sole and even holier sibling: this is very well expressed in the story of the Macedonian king who gave a world-despising Athenian philosopher a talent and got it back. ‘What?’ said the king, ‘Has he then no friend?’5 He meant: ‘I honour this pride of the wise and independent man, but I would honour his humanity even more highly if the friend in him had won over his pride. The philosopher has lowered himself before me by showing that he doesn’t know one of the two highest feelings – and the higher one at that.’&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sceptics.&lt;/em&gt; – I am afraid that old women in their most secret heart of hearts are more sceptical than all men: they believe the superficiality of existence to be its essence, and all virtue and depth is to them merely a veil over this ‘truth’, the very desirable veil over a pudendum – in other words, a matter of decency and shame, and no more!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Devotion.&lt;/em&gt; – There are noble women with a certain poverty of spirit who know no other way to &lt;em&gt;express&lt;/em&gt; their deepest devotion than to offer their virtue and sense of shame: it is what they hold as their highest possession. And often this gift is accepted without incurring as profound an obligation as the donors suppose – a very melancholy story!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The strength of the weak.&lt;/em&gt; – All women are subtle at exaggerating their weaknesses; indeed they are inventive at weaknesses in order to appear as utterly fragile ornaments that are harmed by even a speck of dust: their way of living is supposed to remind men of their clumsiness and burden their conscience with this. Thus they defend themselves against the strong and ‘the law of the jungle’.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Will and willingness.&lt;/em&gt; – Someone took a youth to a wise man and said: ‘Look, he is being corrupted by women!’ The wise man shook his head and smiled. ‘It is men who corrupt women’, he exclaimed, ‘and the failings of women should be atoned for and set right in men – for man makes for himself the image (&lt;em&gt;Bild&lt;/em&gt;) of woman, and woman shapes herself (&lt;em&gt;bildet sich&lt;/em&gt;) according to this image (Bild)’. ‘You are too gentle towards women’, said one in the company; ‘you do not know them!’ The wise man replied, ‘The way of men is will; the way of women is willingness – that is the law of the sexes; truly a hard law for women! All human beings are innocent of their existence; women, however, are doubly innocent. Who could have oil and mercy enough for them?’ ‘Forget oil! Forget gentleness!’ shouted someone else from the crowd; ‘one has to raise women better!’ ‘One has to raise men better’, said the wise man and beckoned to the youth to follow him. – But the youth did not follow him.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Capacity for revenge.&lt;/em&gt; – That someone cannot defend himself and therefore also does not want to – this is not enough to disgrace him in our eyes; but we have a low regard for anyone who has neither the capacity nor the good will for revenge – regardless of whether it is a man or a woman. Would a woman be able to hold us (or ‘enthrall’ us, as they say) if we did not consider her able under certain circumstances to wield a dagger deftly (any kind of dagger) &lt;em&gt;against&lt;/em&gt; us? Or against herself – which in certain cases would be the more severe revenge (Chinese revenge).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Christianity is called the religion of &lt;em&gt;pity&lt;/em&gt;.—Pity stands in opposition to all the tonic passions that augment the energy of the feeling of aliveness: it is a depressant. A man loses power when he pities. Through pity that drain upon strength which suffering works is multiplied a thousandfold. Suffering is made contagious by pity; under certain circumstances it may lead to a total sacrifice of life and living energy—a loss out of all proportion to the magnitude of the cause (—the case of the death of the Nazarene). This is the first view of it; there is, however, a still more important one. If one measures the effects of pity by the gravity of the reactions it sets up, its character as a menace to life appears in a much clearer light. Pity thwarts the whole law of evolution, which is the law of natural selection. It preserves whatever is ripe for destruction; it fights on the side of those disinherited and condemned by life; by maintaining life in so many of the botched of all kinds, it gives life itself a gloomy and dubious aspect. Mankind has ventured to call pity a virtue (—in every &lt;em&gt;superior&lt;/em&gt; moral system it appears as a weakness—); going still further, it has been called &lt;em&gt;the&lt;/em&gt; virtue, the source and foundation of all other virtues—but let us always bear in mind that this was from the standpoint of a philosophy that was nihilistic, and upon whose shield &lt;em&gt;the denial of life&lt;/em&gt; was inscribed. Schopenhauer was right in this: that by means of pity life is denied, and made &lt;em&gt;worthy of denial&lt;/em&gt;—pity is the technic of nihilism. Let me repeat: this depressing and contagious instinct stands against all those instincts which work for the preservation and enhancement of life: in the rôle of &lt;em&gt;protector&lt;/em&gt; of the miserable, it is a prime agent in the promotion of &lt;em&gt;décadence&lt;/em&gt;—pity persuades to extinction&amp;hellip;. Of course, one doesn’t say “extinction”: one says “the other world,” or “God,” or “the &lt;em&gt;true&lt;/em&gt; life,” or Nirvana, salvation, blessedness&amp;hellip;. This innocent rhetoric, from the realm of religious-ethical balderdash, appears &lt;em&gt;a good deal less innocent&lt;/em&gt; when one reflects upon the tendency that it conceals beneath sublime words: the tendency to &lt;em&gt;destroy life&lt;/em&gt;. Schopenhauer was hostile to life: that is why pity appeared to him as a virtue&amp;hellip;. Aristotle, as every one knows, saw in pity a sickly and dangerous state of mind, the remedy for which was an occasional purgative: he regarded tragedy as that purgative. The instinct of life should prompt us to seek some means of puncturing any such pathological and dangerous accumulation of pity as that appearing in Schopenhauer’s case (and also, alack, in that of our whole literary &lt;em&gt;décadence&lt;/em&gt;, from St. Petersburg to Paris, from Tolstoi to Wagner), that it may burst and be discharged&amp;hellip;. Nothing is more unhealthy, amid all our unhealthy modernism, than Christian pity. To be the doctors &lt;em&gt;here&lt;/em&gt;, to be unmerciful &lt;em&gt;here&lt;/em&gt;, to wield the knife &lt;em&gt;here&lt;/em&gt;—all this is &lt;em&gt;our&lt;/em&gt; business, all this is &lt;em&gt;our&lt;/em&gt; sort of humanity, by this sign we are philosophers, we Hyperboreans!—&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Something for the industrious.&lt;/em&gt; – Anyone who now wishes to make a study of moral matters opens up for himself an immense field of work. All kinds of passions have to be thought through separately, pursued separately through ages, peoples, great and small individuals; their entire reason and all their evaluations and modes of illuminating things must be revealed! So far, all that has given colour to existence still lacks a history: where could you find a history of love, of avarice, of envy, of conscience, of piety, of cruelty? Even a comparative history of law or even of punishment is so far lacking entirely. Has anyone done research on the different ways of dividing up the day or of the consequences of a regular schedule of work, festivals, and the rest? Do we know the moral effects of foods? Is there a philosophy of nutrition? (The incessantly erupting clamour for and against vegetarianism proves that there is still no such philosophy!) Has anyone collected people’s experiences of living together – in monasteries, for example? Has anyone depicted the dialectic of marriage and friendship? The customs of scholars, businessmen, artists, artisans – have they found their thinkers? There is so much in them to think about! Everything that humans have viewed until now as the ‘conditions of their existence’ and all the reason, passion, and superstition that such a view involves – has this been researched exhaustively? To observe how differently the human drives have grown and still could grow depending on the moral climate – that alone involves too much work for even the most industrious; it would require whole generations, and generations of scholars who would collaborate systematically, to exhaust the points of view and the material. The same applies to the demonstration of the reasons for the variety of moral climates (&lt;em&gt;‘why&lt;/em&gt; does the sun of one fundamental moral judgement and primary value-standard shine here – and another one there?’). Yet another new project would be to determine the erroneousness of all these reasons and the whole essence of moral judgements to date. If all these jobs were done, the most delicate question of all would emerge in the foreground: whether science is able to &lt;em&gt;furnish&lt;/em&gt; goals of action after having proved that it can take such goals away and annihilate them; and then an experimenting would be in order, in which every kind of heroism could find satisfaction – an experimenting that might last for centuries and eclipse all the great projects and sacrifices of history to date. So far, science has not yet built its cyclops-buildings;5 but the time for that will come, too.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;“Dattatreya is unique. But then, his father was a Rishi. Each Rishi offers his own experience to the world by sending down his essence to be bom as a prophet or a saint, to guide and teach. When things on Earth come to such a pass that the continued existence of the Rishis&amp;rsquo; Lila seems threat ened, a Rishi will send down an emanation of himself to guide the errant sheep back to the fold, as Jesus tried to do. As Lord Krishna says in the Gita, &amp;lsquo;Whenever righteousness declines and unrighteousness increases I then take birth in the world, to protect the just, destroy the wicked, and re-estab lish righteousness.&amp;rsquo; Krishna, Rama and Jesus were all amshas (fragments, fractions) of Rishis. They were very different from you and me; they were avataras, embodiments of divinity.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;With Two Supplements&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;1&#34;&gt;1&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;‘HUMAN, All Too Human’ is the memorial of a crisis. It calls itself a book for &lt;em&gt;free&lt;/em&gt; spirits: almost every sentence in it is the expression of a victory − with this book I liberated myself from that in my nature which &lt;em&gt;did not belong to me.&lt;/em&gt; Idealism does not belong to me: the title says: ‘where &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt; see ideal things, &lt;em&gt;I&lt;/em&gt; see − human, alas all too human things!’… I know humanity &lt;em&gt;better…&lt;/em&gt; The expression ‘free spirit’ should here be understood in no other sense: a spirit that has &lt;em&gt;become free,&lt;/em&gt; that has again seized possession of itself. The tone, the sound of the voice has completely changed: one will find the book sagacious, cool, sometimes harsh and mocking. A certain spirituality of &lt;em&gt;noble&lt;/em&gt; taste seems to be in constant struggle to keep itself aloft above a more passionate current running underneath. In this connection there is significance in the fact that it is actually the hundredth anniversary of the death of Voltaire with which the book as it were apologizes for being published in 1878. For Voltaire is, in contrast to all who have written after him, above all a &lt;em&gt;grandseigneur&lt;/em&gt; of the spirit: precisely what I am too. − The name of Voltaire on a writing by me − that really was progress − &lt;em&gt;towards myself&lt;/em&gt;… If one looks more closely, one discovers a merciless spirit who knows every hiding-place in which the ideal is at home − where it has its castle-keep and as it were its last place of security. With a torch in hand which gives no trembling light I illuminate with piercing brightness this &lt;em&gt;underworld&lt;/em&gt; of the ideal. It is a war, but a war without powder and smoke, without warlike attitudes, without pathos and contorted limbs − all this would still have been ‘idealism’. One error after another is calmly laid on ice, the ideal is not refuted − &lt;em&gt;it freezes…&lt;/em&gt; Here for example ‘the genius’ freezes; on the next corner ‘the saint’ freezes; ‘the hero’ freezes into a thick icicle; at last ‘faith’, so-called ‘conviction’, freezes; ‘pity’ also grows considerably cooler − almost everywhere ‘the thing in itself freezes…&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;If you hope to continue to exist after Kundalini is awakened completely you must be able to make Her go from the Muladhara to the Sahasrara, and then in the reverse direction, downwards from the Sahasrara to the&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;( 771&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;AGHORA II: Kundalini&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Muladhara, under perfect control. Prana and Apana are then perfectly united. Apana is represented as a downward-pointing triangle, and Prana as an upward-pointing one. Their union forms a six-pointed star.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;OUR GREATEST TINGLE during the Spring 1979 Bombay Race Meeting was the announcement of a blessed event: the debut in our world of Stoney&amp;rsquo;s first foal, a colt whom Vimalananda promptly named Redstone. The spring&amp;rsquo;s most unusual incident, however, occurred midseason when Vimalananda felt obliged to exercise yet another of his siddhis to deal with Behram, the husband of Shernaz and father of Arzoo. He had unexpectedly and inoppor tunely arrived in Poona from Iran just in time for Navroz, the ancient Persian New Year&amp;rsquo;s Day which many Indian Zoroastrians still celebrate.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;If a four-year-old boy were to sit on top of his dead grandmother, pick up his father’s japamala and begin to do japa, what sort of boy would you say he is? You would have to say he was born to do Smashan Sadhana. I have seen a boy who did that. Why, even I, when I was a child, used to build toy funeral pyres out of twigs and matchsticks; it’s an inborn tendency in someone who is meant to be an Aghori.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;“And all this is due to the chemical composition of the speaker&amp;rsquo;s con sciousness,&amp;quot; I volunteered, as I thought I knew which direction Vimalanan da’s discourse was heading&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;He nodded his assent. “And this chemical composition determines what sort of sadhana is appropriate for you, what you can succeed at. There is no lack of people today who claim to have located the keys to the Vedas, and who claim that they are living a &amp;lsquo;Vedic&amp;rsquo; life, and teaching their disciples &amp;lsquo;Vedic&amp;rsquo; sadhanas. Most of them are gasbagging; they are talking out of their wits. Think, for a moment, about the caste system. India has been plagued by casteism for centuries, but the caste system started out as something quite different from what it has become.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The women who master the masters.&lt;/em&gt; – A deep and powerful alto voice, such as one sometimes hears in the theatre, suddenly raises the curtain upon possibilities that we usually do not believe in. All at once we believe that somewhere in the world there could be women with lofty, heroic, royal souls, capable of and ready for grandiose retorts, resolutions, and sacrifices, capable of and ready for mastery over men, because in them the best of man aside from his sex has become an incarnate ideal. To be sure, the intention of the theatre is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; at all that such voices convey this concept of women; normally they are supposed to represent the ideal male lover, for example a Romeo; but to judge from my experience, the theatre quite regularly miscalculates on this point, as does the composer who expects such effects from such a voice. One does not believe in &lt;em&gt;these&lt;/em&gt; lovers: such voices always retain a motherly and housewifely colouring, and most of all when love is in their tone.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;On female chastity.&lt;/em&gt; – There is something quite amazing and monstrous in the upbringing of upper-class women; indeed, maybe there is nothing more paradoxical. The whole world agrees that they should be brought up as ignorant as possible about matters erotic, and that one has to impart in their souls a deep shame in the face of such things and the most extreme impatience and flight at the merest suggestion of them. Really, in this matter alone the ‘honour’ of a woman in its entirety is at risk: what else would one not forgive them? But here they are supposed to remain ignorant deep in their hearts: they are supposed to have neither eyes, nor ears, nor words, nor thoughts for this their ‘evil’; yes, even knowledge is here an evil. And then to be hurled as if by a gruesome lightning bolt into reality and knowledge, with marriage – and precisely by the man they love and esteem the most: to catch love and shame in a contradiction and to have to experience all at once delight, surrender, duty, pity, terror at the unexpected proximity of god and beast, and who knows what else! There one has tied a psychic knot that may have no equal. Even the compassionate curiosity of the wisest connoisseur of human psychology (&lt;em&gt;Menschenkenner&lt;/em&gt;) is insufficient for guessing how this or that woman manages to accommodate herself to this solution of the riddle and to this riddle of a solution, and what dreadful, far-reaching suspicions must stir in her poor, unhinged soul; indeed, how the ultimate philosophy and scepticism of woman casts anchor at this point! Afterwards, the same deep silence as before, and often a silence directed at herself; she closes her eyes to herself. Young women try very hard to appear superficial and thoughtless; the most refined among them simulate a kind of impertinence. Women easily experience their men as a question-mark regarding their honour and their children as an apology or atonement – they need children and wish for them in an altogether different way from that in which a man wishes for children. In sum, one cannot be too gentle towards women!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mothers.&lt;/em&gt; – Animals think differently about females than humans do; they consider the female to be the productive being. There is no paternal love among them, only something like love for the children of a beloved and a getting used to them. In their children females have a satisfaction of their desire to dominate, a possession, an occupation, something that is totally intelligible to them and can be prattled with: all this taken together is motherly love – it is to be compared to the love of an artist for his work. Pregnancy has made women gentler, more patient, more timid, more pleased to submit; and just so does spiritual pregnancy produce the character of the contemplative type, to which the female character is related: these are male mothers. – Among animals the male sex is considered the beautiful one.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Holy cruelty.&lt;/em&gt; – A man holding a newborn in his hand approached a holy man. ‘What should I do with this child?’ he asked; ‘it is wretched, misshapen, and doesn’t have life enough to die’. ‘Kill it!’ shouted the holy man with a terrible voice; ‘kill it and hold it in your arms for three days and three nights to create a memory for yourself: thus you will never again beget a child when it is not time for you to beget’. When the man had heard this, he walked away disappointed; and many people reproached the holy man because he had advised a cruelty; for he had advised killing the child. ‘But is it not crueller to let it live?’ said the holy man.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The greatest danger.&lt;/em&gt; – Had there not always been a majority of men who felt the discipline of their heads – their ‘rationality’ – to be their pride, their obligation, their virtue, and who were embarrassed or ashamed by all fantasizing and debauchery of thought, being the friends of ‘healthy common sense’, humanity would have perished long ago! The greatest danger that hovered and still hovers over humanity is the outbreak of &lt;em&gt;madness&lt;/em&gt; – that is, the outbreak of arbitrariness in feeling, seeing, and hearing; the enjoyment in the lack of discipline of the head, the joy in human unreason. The opposite of the world of the madman is not truth and certainty but the generality and universal bindingness of a faith; in short, the non-arbitrary in judgement. And man’s greatest labour so far has been to reach agreement about very many things and to lay down a &lt;em&gt;law of agreement&lt;/em&gt; – regardless of whether these things are true or false. This is the discipline of the head which has preserved humanity – but the counter-drives are still so powerful that it is basically with little confidence that one may speak of the future of humanity. The picture of things still moves and shifts continually, and perhaps more and faster from now on than ever before; continually, the most select minds bristle at this universal bindingness – the explorers of &lt;em&gt;truth&lt;/em&gt; above all! Continually this faith, as a commonplace belief shared by everyone, breeds nausea and a new lust in subtler minds; and the slow tempo for all spiritual processes which this faith makes necessary, this imitation of the tortoise that is recognized as the norm here, would by itself be sufficient to turn artists and poets into deserters: it is these impatient minds in whom a veritable delight in madness breaks out, because madness has such a cheerful tempo! What is needed, then, are virtuous intellects – oh, I’ll use the most unambiguous word – what is needed is &lt;em&gt;virtuous stupidity;&lt;/em&gt; what is needed are unwavering beat-keepers of the &lt;em&gt;slow&lt;/em&gt; spirit, so that the believers of the great common faith stay together and go on dancing their dance: it is an exigency of the first order which commands and demands. &lt;em&gt;We others are the exception and the danger&lt;/em&gt; – we stand eternally in need of defence! – Now there is certainly something to be said for the exception, &lt;em&gt;provided it never wants to become the rule.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The animal with a good conscience.&lt;/em&gt; – The vulgar element in everything that pleases in Southern Europe – be it Italian opera (e.g. Rossini and Bellini)8 or the Spanish adventure novel (most readily accessible to us in the French disguise of Gil Blas)9 – does not escape me; but it does not offend me, just as little as does the vulgarity that one encounters on a walk through Pompeii and basically even when reading any ancient book.10 Why is this? Is it because there is no shame and everything vulgar acts as confidently and self-assuredly as anything noble, lovely, and passionate in the same kind of music or novel? ‘The animal has its own right, just like the human being; let it run about freely – and you too, my dear fellow man, are still an animal despite everything!’ – That seems to me to be the moral of the story and the peculiarity of Southern humanity. Bad taste has its right just as good taste does – and even a prior right if it answers to a great need, provides guaranteed satisfaction and as it were a universal language, an unconditionally intelligible mask and gesture; good, refined taste, on the contrary, is always somewhat searching, deliberate, not altogether sure how it is to be understood: it is not and never was popular! What is and remains popular is the &lt;em&gt;mask!&lt;/em&gt; So let them all continue to go their way, all those masklike elements in the melodies and cadenzas, in the leaps and gaieties of the rhythm of these operas! Ancient life, too! What can one understand about it when one does not understand the delight in the mask, the good conscience in everything mask-like! Here is the bath and the recreation of the ancient spirit – and maybe the rare and sublime natures of the old world needed this bath more than the vulgar. A vulgar turn in Northern works, for example in German music, on the other hand, offends me unspeakably. Here there is &lt;em&gt;shame;&lt;/em&gt; the artist has lowered himself in his own eyes and could not even help blushing: we are ashamed with him and are so offended because we suspect that he believed he had to lower himself for our sakes.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;What we should be grateful for.&lt;/em&gt; – Only artists, and especially those of the theatre, have given men eyes and ears to see and hear with some pleasure what each himself is, himself experiences, himself wants; only they have taught us to value the hero that is hidden in each of these everyday characters and taught the art of regarding oneself as a hero, from a distance and as it were simplified and transfigured – the art of ‘putting oneself on stage’ before oneself. Only thus can we get over certain lowly details in ourselves. Without this art we would be nothing but foreground, and would live entirely under the spell of that perspective which makes the nearest and most vulgar appear tremendously big and as reality itself. Maybe there is a similar sort of merit in that religion which bade one to see the sinfulness of every individual through a magnifying glass and turned the sinner into a great, immortal criminal: by describing eternal perspectives around him, it taught man to view himself from a distance and as something past and whole.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The attraction of imperfection.&lt;/em&gt; – I see here a poet who, like some people, exerts a greater attraction through his imperfections than through all that reaches completion and perfection under his hand – indeed, his advantage and fame are due much more to his ultimate incapacity than to his ample strength. His work never wholly expresses what he really would like to express, what he &lt;em&gt;would like to have seen:&lt;/em&gt; it seems as if he has had the foretaste of a vision, but never the vision itself – yet a tremendous lust for this vision remains in his soul, and it is from this that he derives his equally tremendous eloquence of desire and craving. With it he lifts his listener above his work and all ‘works’ and lends him wings to rise to heights which listeners otherwise never reach; and so, having themselves become poets and seers, they give the creator of their happiness their due admiration, as if he had led them immediately to the vision of what was for him holiest and most ultimate; as if he had really attained his goal and really &lt;em&gt;seen&lt;/em&gt; and communicated his vision. The fact that he never reached his goal benefits his fame.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It is necessary to say just &lt;em&gt;whom&lt;/em&gt; we regard as our antagonists: theologians and all who have any theological blood in their veins—this is our whole philosophy&amp;hellip;. One must have faced that menace at close hand, better still, one must have had experience of it directly and almost succumbed to it, to realize that it is not to be taken lightly (—the alleged free-thinking of our naturalists and physiologists seems to me to be a joke—they have no passion about such things; they have not suffered—). This poisoning goes a great deal further than most people think: I find the arrogant habit of the theologian among all who regard themselves as “idealists”—among all who, by virtue of a higher point of departure, claim a right to rise above reality, and to look upon it with suspicion&amp;hellip;. The idealist, like the ecclesiastic, carries all sorts of lofty concepts in his hand (—and not only in his hand!); he launches them with benevolent contempt against “understanding,” “the senses,” “honor,” “good living,” “science”; he sees such things as &lt;em&gt;beneath&lt;/em&gt; him, as pernicious and seductive forces, on which “the soul” soars as a pure thing-in-itself—as if humility, chastity, poverty, in a word, &lt;em&gt;holiness&lt;/em&gt;, had not already done much more damage to life than all imaginable horrors and vices&amp;hellip;. The pure soul is a pure lie&amp;hellip;. So long as the priest, that &lt;em&gt;professional&lt;/em&gt; denier, calumniator and poisoner of life, is accepted as a &lt;em&gt;higher&lt;/em&gt; variety of man, there can be no answer to the question, What &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; truth? Truth has already been stood on its head when the obvious attorney of mere emptiness is mistaken for its representative&amp;hellip;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Unconscious virtues.&lt;/em&gt; – All qualities of a person of which he is conscious – and especially those he supposes to be visible and plain to others also – are subject to laws of development entirely different from those qualities which are unknown or badly known to him, which conceal themselves by means of their subtlety even from the eye of a rather subtle observer and which know how to hide as if behind nothing at all. This might be compared to the subtle sculptures on the scales of reptiles: it would be a mistake to take them for ornaments or weapons, since one sees them only with a microscope, i.e. with an artificially sharpened eye, which similar animals for whom they might signify something like ornaments or weapons simply lack. Our visible moral qualities, and especially those that we &lt;em&gt;believe&lt;/em&gt; to be visible, take their course; and the invisible ones, which have the same names but are neither ornaments nor weapons with regard to others, &lt;em&gt;also take their course:&lt;/em&gt; probably a totally different one, with lines and subtleties and sculptures that might amuse a god with a divine microscope. For example, we have our diligence, our ambition, our acuteness – all the world knows about them – and in addition, we probably also have &lt;em&gt;our&lt;/em&gt; industry, &lt;em&gt;our&lt;/em&gt; ambition, &lt;em&gt;our&lt;/em&gt; acuteness; but for these reptile scales, no microscope has yet been invented! At this point the friends of instinctive morality will say: ‘Bravo! At least he considers unconscious virtues to be possible – and that’s enough for us.’ Oh, how little you are satisfied with!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;One of my friends once asked me, “Is there ever one moment of the day when you are not doing Avishkara?” What could I tell him? Does he know the wonderful joy of Avishkara? He can’t imagine it because he does not really know how to love.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AVISHKARA&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When I say that spirits can be helpful, I am sure you cannot imagine all the ramifications of such a statement. Let me explain it in this way. Why do we Hindus worship stone or metal or wooden images of our deities? We are not worshipping the image; we are requesting the deity to come in His or Her ethereal form and take possession of the image, where we then concentrate our worship. We treat the image as a living being, because a ritual called &lt;em&gt;Prana Pratishtha&lt;/em&gt; is performed in which &lt;em&gt;prana,&lt;/em&gt; the life force, is actually transmitted into the image.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Thoughts about Morality as a Prejudice&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;i&#34;&gt;I&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;WITH this book begins my campaign against &lt;em&gt;morality.&lt;/em&gt; Not that it smells in the slightest of gunpowder – quite other and more pleasant odours will be perceived in it, provided one has some subtlety in one’s nostrils. Neither big nor even small guns: if the effect of the book is negative, its means are all the less so, means from which the effect follows like a conclusion &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; like a cannon-shot. That one takes leave of the book with a cautious reserve in regard to everything that has hitherto been honoured and even worshipped under the name morality does not contradict the fact that in the entire book there is no negative word, no attack, no malice – that it rather lies in the sun, round, happy, like a sea-beast sunning itself among rocks. In the end it was I myself who was this sea-beast: almost every sentence in the book was thought, &lt;em&gt;tracked down&lt;/em&gt; among that confusion of rocks near to Genoa where I was alone and still shared secrets with the sea. Even now, when I chance to light on this book every sentence becomes for me a spike with which I again draw something incomparable out of the depths: its entire skin trembles with tender shudders of recollection. The art in which it is preeminent is no small one in making things which easily slip by without a sound, moments which I call divine lizards, stay still for a little – not with the cruelty of that young Greek god who simply impaled the poor little lizard, but none the less still with something sharp, with the pen… ‘There are so many daybreaks that have not yet dawned’ – this &lt;em&gt;Indian&lt;/em&gt; inscription stands on the gateway to this book. Where does its author &lt;em&gt;seek&lt;/em&gt; that new dawn, that hitherto still undetected tender roseate sky with which another day – ah, a whole series, a whole world of new days! – breaks? In a &lt;em&gt;revaluation of all values,&lt;/em&gt; in an escape from all moral values, in an affirmation of and trust in all that has hitherto been forbidden, despised, accursed. This &lt;em&gt;affirmative&lt;/em&gt; book pours its light, its love, its tenderness upon nothing but evil things, it restores to them their ‘soul’, the good conscience, the exalted right and &lt;em&gt;privilege&lt;/em&gt; to exist. Morality is not attacked, it only no longer comes into consideration… This book ends with an ‘Or?’ – it is the only book which ends with an ‘Or?’…&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;VIMALANANDA&amp;rsquo;S INTEREST IN his spiritual children&amp;rsquo; had been corrod ing for some time, for they were proving to be no more dedicated than Shan karacharya&amp;rsquo;s &amp;lsquo;sons. It waned yet further on the morning that he had a visitation from Doshi&amp;rsquo;s wife. She and Doshi had come to Poona that weekend to accompany us for some homa nearby, and were staying in the hotel room that was next door to Vimalananda&amp;rsquo;s. Apparently these two, conniving per haps with some of the other children, had decided that it was time for Vima lananda to part with some of his Tantric sexual knowledge. Mrs. Doshi had therefore knocked at Vimalananda&amp;rsquo;s door braless, her sari barely covering her sagging middle-aged bosoms, to beseech this expert for a Vajroli practicum, or at the very least a how-to course in Lata Mudra. It was very difficult for me to see how the evidently dissolute Mrs. Doshi could have any chance to suc ceed at Lata Mudra, a practice in which two sexual partners invoke Lord Shiva and his Grand Consort Parvati into their bodies before they dally together. How then could she even dream of Vajroli, in which you use your genitals to suck up your partner&amp;rsquo;s secretions during intercourse?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;As Joseph Campbell documents in his book The Inner Reaches of Outer Space, the force that the Tantras call Kundalini has been represented as a ser pent in many world cultures, including the Sumerian, Chinese, ancient Irish, Aztec and Greek (the caduceus). Images of Kundalini as the Serpent Power predominantly reflect Her power of possessiveness, of Maya. Indian cosmology describes seven netherworlds beneath the surface of the earth in which dwell asuras (the &amp;ldquo;selfish&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;jealous” gods) and nagas (semi-divine snake beings). In the microcosm the &amp;lsquo;surface of the earth&amp;rsquo; is the Muladhara Chakra; &amp;lsquo;dwelling beneath the earth&amp;rsquo;s surface&amp;rsquo; means living wholly in objec tive reality, within the realm of Maya, which is the skin of the universe.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Art and nature.&lt;/em&gt; – The Greeks (or at least the Athenians) liked to hear good speech; indeed, they had a greedy craving for it which distinguishes them more than anything else from the non-Greeks. And so they demanded even of passion on stage that it speak well, and submitted with delight to the unnaturalness of dramatic verse – after all, in nature, passion is so taciturn! So mute and bashful! Or when it finds words, so confused and irrational and a shame to itself! Now thanks to the Greeks, we have all grown accustomed to this unnaturalness on stage, just as we endure and gladly endure that other unnaturalness, &lt;em&gt;singing&lt;/em&gt; passion, thanks to the Italians. We have developed a need that we cannot satisfy in reality: to hear people in the most difficult situations speak well and at length; it delights us now when the tragic hero still finds words, reasons, eloquent gestures, and altogether a radiant spirit where life approaches the abyss and a real human being would usually lose his head and certainly his fine language. This kind of &lt;em&gt;deviation from nature&lt;/em&gt; is perhaps the most pleasant meal for human pride; for its sake man loves art as the expression of a lofty, heroic unnaturalness and convention. We rightly reproach a dramatic poet if he does not transform everything into reason and words but always retains in his hand a residue of &lt;em&gt;silence&lt;/em&gt; – just as one is dissatisfied with the musician at the opera who cannot find a melody for the highest affect but only a sentimental ‘natural’ stammering and screaming. For here nature is &lt;em&gt;supposed&lt;/em&gt; to be contradicted! Here the vulgar charm of illusion is &lt;em&gt;supposed&lt;/em&gt; to give way to a higher charm! The Greeks go far, far on this road – terrifyingly far! Just as they make the stage as narrow as possible and forbid themselves all effects through deep backgrounds; just as they make facial expressions and easy movement impossible for the actor and transform him into a solemn, stiff, masked puppet, so they also have deprived passion itself of any deep background and dictated to it a law of beautiful speech; yes, on the whole they have done everything to counteract the elemental effect of images that arouse fear and compassion – &lt;em&gt;for fear and compassion were precisely what they did not want.&lt;/em&gt; With all due respect to Aristotle, he certainly didn’t hit the nail, let alone on the head, when he discussed the final purpose of Greek tragedy.11 Just consider the Greek tragic poets and what most stimulated their industriousness, their sensitivity, their competitiveness – certainly not the aim of overwhelming the spectator with emotions. The Athenian went to the theatre &lt;em&gt;to hear pleasing speech!&lt;/em&gt; Pleasing speeches were what preoccupied Sophocles12 – pardon the heresy! It is quite different with &lt;em&gt;serious opera.&lt;/em&gt; All of its masters try to keep the audience from understanding the characters. Occasionally catching a word might help the inattentive listener, but on the whole the situation must explain itself – the speeches don’t matter! This is how they all think and have pulled their pranks with words. Maybe they only lacked the courage to express fully their ultimate disregard for words: with just a little more impudence, Rossini13 would have had everyone sing nothing but la-la-la-la – and that would have made good sense. One shouldn’t believe the words of characters in opera, but rather their sound! That is the difference, that is the beautiful &lt;em&gt;unnaturalness&lt;/em&gt; for the sake of which one goes to the opera. Even the &lt;em&gt;recitativo&lt;/em&gt; secco14 is not really meant to be heard as word and text: this kind of half-music is rather supposed initially to give the musical ear a short rest (rest from the &lt;em&gt;melody&lt;/em&gt; as the most sublime and therefore also the most challenging pleasure of this art) – but very soon also something else, namely, a growing impatience, a growing aversion, a new desire for &lt;em&gt;whole&lt;/em&gt; music, for melody. How are things with Richard Wagner’s art,15 considered from this perspective? Is it the same, perhaps? Perhaps different? Often it has seemed to me as if one had to memorize the words &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; music of his creations before the performance, for otherwise – so it appeared to me – one &lt;em&gt;would hear&lt;/em&gt; neither the words nor even the music.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Greek taste.&lt;/em&gt; – ‘What is beautiful about that?’ said the surveyor after a performance of &lt;em&gt;Iphigenia.&lt;/em&gt; ‘Nothing is proved in it!’16 Were the Greeks that far away from this taste? In Sophocles, at least, ‘everything is proved’.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Esprit17 as un-Greek.&lt;/em&gt; – The Greeks are indescribably logical and simple in all their thought; at least in their long good age they never wearied of this, as so often do the French, who all too gladly take a little leap into the opposite and actually only endure the spirit of logic when, through a series of such small leaps into the opposite, it betrays its &lt;em&gt;sociable&lt;/em&gt; civility, its sociable self-denial. Logic strikes them as necessary, like bread and water, but also, like these, as a kind of prisoners’ food as soon as it is enjoyed pure and plain. In good company one must never want to be entirely and solely right, which is what all pure logic wants; hence the small dose of unreason in all French &lt;em&gt;esprit.&lt;/em&gt; The Greeks’ sense of sociability was far less developed than that of the French is and was; that is why there is so little &lt;em&gt;esprit&lt;/em&gt; in even their most spirited men; that is why there is so little humour in even their humorists; that is why – oh! One will not even believe these sentences of mine, and how many more of the same sort are yet on my mind! – &lt;em&gt;Est res magna tacere&lt;/em&gt;18 – says Martial along with all garrulous people.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Translations.&lt;/em&gt; – One can estimate the degree of an age’s historical sense from the way it makes &lt;em&gt;translations&lt;/em&gt; and seeks to absorb past ages and books. The French of Corneille’s age19 as well as those of the Revolution seized Roman antiquity in a way we no longer dare to – thanks to our higher historical sense. And Roman antiquity itself: how violently and yet naively it laid its hand on everything good and lofty in the older Greek antiquity! How they translated things into the Roman present! How deliberately and insouciantly they brushed the dust off the wings of that butterfly called ‘The-Twinkling-of-an-Eye’! In this way Horace translated Alcaeus or Archilochus20 now and then, as did Propertius with Callimachus and Philetas (poets of the same rank as Theocritus,21if we &lt;em&gt;may&lt;/em&gt; judge): what did they care that the real creator had experienced this and that and written the signs of it into his poem! As poets they were averse to the antiquarian inquisitiveness that precedes the sense for history; as poets, they did not accept these utterly personal things and names and all those things that serve as the mask and costume of a city, coast, century. Rather they quickly replaced them with what was contemporary and Roman. They seem to ask us: ‘Should we not make new for ourselves what is old and put &lt;em&gt;ourselves&lt;/em&gt; into it? Should we not be allowed to breathe our soul into their dead body? For it is dead, after all: how ugly everything dead is!’ They did not know the pleasure of a sense for history; what was past and alien was embarrassing to them; and as Romans, they saw it as an incentive for a Roman conquest. In fact at that time one conquered by translating – not merely by leaving out the historical, but also by adding allusions to the present and, above all, crossing out the name of the poet and replacing it with one’s own – not with any sense of theft but with the very best conscience of the *imperium Romanum.*22&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;On the origin of poetry.&lt;/em&gt; – The lovers of what is fantastic in humans, who also advocate the view that morality is instinctive, reason as follows: ‘Supposing that usefulness has always been venerated as the supreme deity, then where in all the world does poetry come from? This act of making speech rhythm counteracts rather than contributes to the clarity of communication, and yet it has shot up and is still shooting up all over the earth like a mockery of all useful expediency! The wildly beautiful irrationality of poetry refutes you, you utilitarians! Precisely to want to &lt;em&gt;get away&lt;/em&gt; from usefulness for once – that is what has elevated humanity; that is what has inspired it to morality and art!’ Now, in this case I must side with the utilitarians for once – after all, they are so seldom right, it is pitiful! In those ancient times that called poetry into being, one really did aim at utility, and a very great utility at that; back then, when one let rhythm penetrate speech – that rhythmic force that reorganizes all the atoms of a sentence, bids one to select one’s words and gives thoughts a new colour and makes them darker, stranger, more distant: a &lt;em&gt;superstitious utility,&lt;/em&gt; of course! Rhythm was supposed to make a human request impress the gods more deeply after it was noticed that humans remember a verse better than ordinary speech; one also thought one could make oneself audible over greater distances with the rhythmic tick-tock; the rhythmic prayer seemed to get closer to the ears of the gods. Above all, one wanted to take advantage of that elemental overpowering force that humans experience in themselves when listening to music: rhythm is a compulsion; it engenders an unconquerable desire to yield, to join in; not only the stride of the feet but also the soul itself gives in to the beat – probably also, one inferred, the souls of the gods! By means of rhythm one thus tried to &lt;em&gt;compel&lt;/em&gt; them and to exercise a power over them: one cast poetry around them like a magical snare. There was another, stranger notion, and it may be precisely what contributed most powerfully to the origin of poetry. Among the Pythagoreans23 it appears as a philosophical doctrine and as an educational contrivance; but even long before there were philosophers, one acknowledged music to have the power to discharge the emotions, to cleanse the soul, to soothe the &lt;em&gt;ferocia animi&lt;/em&gt;24 – and indeed precisely through its rhythmic quality. When one had lost the proper tension and harmony of the soul, one had to &lt;em&gt;dance&lt;/em&gt; to the beat of the singer – that was the prescription of this healing art. With it, Terpander quelled an uprising; with it, Empedocles pacified a lunatic; with it, Damon purged a youth who was languishing from love; with it, one also sought to appease the ferocious, vindictive gods.25 One began by driving the giddiness and exuberance of their passions to their peak, that is, one drove the madman wild, made the vindictive person drunk with lust for revenge. All orgiastic cults wanted to discharge the &lt;em&gt;ferocia&lt;/em&gt;26 of some deity all at once and turn it into an orgy so that the deity would feel freer and calmer afterwards and leave man in peace. Etymologically, &lt;em&gt;melos&lt;/em&gt;27 means a tranquillizer, not because it is itself tranquil, but because its effect makes one tranquil. And not only in the cult song, but also in the mundane song of the most ancient times there is the presumption that rhythmic quality exercises a magical force; when bailing water, for instance, or rowing, the song is a bewitchment of the demons believed to be at work here; it makes them compliant, unfree, and a tool of humans. And whenever one acts, one has an occasion to sing – &lt;em&gt;every&lt;/em&gt; action is tied to the assistance of spirits: incantation and conjuration seem to be the primordial form of poetry. When verse was used in oracles – the Greeks said that the hexameter was invented at Delphi – rhythm was also supposed to exercise a compulsion.28 To ask for a prophecy – that meant originally (according to the derivation of the Greek word that seems most probable to me) to have something determined: one thought one could force the future by gaining Apollo’s favour – he who according to the oldest views is much more than a god of foresight. The way the formula is pronounced, with literal and rhythmic precision, is how it binds the future; the formula, however, is the invention of Apollo, who as god of rhythm can also bind the goddesses of fate. In short: was there anything more &lt;em&gt;useful&lt;/em&gt; than rhythm to the old superstitious type of human being? One could do everything with it: promote some work magically; compel a god to appear, to be near, to listen; mould the future according to one’s own will; discharge some excess (of fear, of mania, of pity, of vengefulness) from one’s soul, and not only one’s own soul but also that of the most evil demon. Without verse one was nothing; through verse one almost became a god. Such a basic feeling cannot be completely eradicated – and still today, after millennia of work at fighting such superstition, even the wisest of us occasionally becomes a fool for rhythm, if only in so far as he &lt;em&gt;feels&lt;/em&gt; a thought to be &lt;em&gt;truer&lt;/em&gt; when it has a metric form and presents itself with a divine hop, skip, and jump. Is it not amusing that the most serious philosophers, strict as they otherwise are in all matters of certainty, still appeal to &lt;em&gt;the sayings of poets&lt;/em&gt; to lend their thoughts force and credibility? And yet it is more dangerous for a truth when a poet agrees with it than when he contradicts it! For as Homer says: ‘The bards tell many a lie’.29&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The good and the beautiful.&lt;/em&gt; – Artists constantly &lt;em&gt;glorify&lt;/em&gt; – they do nothing else – and in particular all those states and things reputed to give man the occasion for once to feel good, or great, or drunk, or merry, or well and wise. These &lt;em&gt;select&lt;/em&gt; things and states, whose value for human &lt;em&gt;happiness&lt;/em&gt; is considered certain and well-defined, are the artists’ objects: artists always lie in wait to discover such things and to draw them into the realm of art. I want to say: they are not themselves the appraisers of happiness and of the happy man, but they always crowd around these appraisers with the greatest curiosity and the urge to make immediate use of their appraisals. They become like this because in addition to their impatience they also have the big lungs of heralds and the feet of runners, and are always among the first to glorify the &lt;em&gt;new&lt;/em&gt; good, and often &lt;em&gt;appear&lt;/em&gt; to be the first to name it good and to appraise it as good. This, however, as I already said, is a mistake: they are only quicker and louder than the real appraisers. – But who &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; the real appraisers? – The rich and the idle.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;On theatre.&lt;/em&gt; – This day I had strong and elevated feelings again, and if on its eve I could have music and art, I know very well what music and art I would &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; like to have, namely, the kind that tries to intoxicate its audience and &lt;em&gt;drive it to the height&lt;/em&gt; of a moment of strong and elevated feelings – an art for those everyday souls who in the evening look not like victors on triumphal chariots but rather like tired mules who have been whipped somewhat too often by life. What would those people know of ‘higher moods’ were there no intoxicating substances and whip-lashes of ideals! – and so they have their inspirers as they have their wines. But what is their drink and their drunkenness &lt;em&gt;to me!&lt;/em&gt; What is wine to the inspired! He looks instead with a sort of disgust at the means and the mediators that are supposed to produce an effect without sufficient reason – aping the high tide of the soul! What? One gives the mole wings and proud conceits – before bedtime, before he crawls into his hole? One sends him to the theatre and puts big glasses before his blind and tired eyes? People whose lives are not a ‘dramatic action’ but a business sit before the stage and look at strange creatures for whom life is more than a business? ‘It’s proper that way’, you say; ‘it’s entertaining that way; it’s culture!’ Well then! In that case I all too often lack culture, for this sight is all too often disgusting to me. Whoever has enough tragedy and comedy in himself probably does best to stay away from the theatre; or, should there be an exception, the entire event – including theatre and audience and poet – becomes the actual tragic and comic spectacle to him, so that the piece that is performed means little to him by comparison. What do the Fausts and Manfreds30 of the theatre matter to someone who is himself somewhat like Faust and Manfred? – whereas the fact &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; such figures are brought on stage is certainly something for him to think about. The &lt;em&gt;strongest&lt;/em&gt; thoughts and passions are there presented before those who are capable not of thought and passion – but of &lt;em&gt;intoxication!&lt;/em&gt; And the &lt;em&gt;former&lt;/em&gt; as a means to the latter! And theatre and music as the hashish-smoking and betel-chewing of the European! Oh, who will tell us the entire history of narcotics? – It is nearly the history of ‘culture’, our so-called higher culture!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;On the vanity of artists.&lt;/em&gt; – I believe that artists often do not know what they can do best because they are too vain and have set their minds on something prouder than these small plants seem to be that are new, strange, and beautiful and really capable of growing to perfection on their soil. That which in the last instance is good in their own garden and vineyard is not fully appreciated by them, and their love and insight are not of the same order. Here is a musician who, more than any other musician, is master at finding the tones from the realm of suffering, dejected, tormented souls and at giving speech even to the mute animals. Nobody equals him at the colours of late autumn, at the indescribably moving happiness of a last, very last, very briefest enjoyment; he knows a tone for those secret, uncanny midnights of the soul, where cause and effect seem to have gone awry and something can come to be ‘from nothing’ at any moment; more happily than anyone else, he draws from the very bottom of human happiness and so to speak from its drained cup, where the most bitter and repulsive drops have merged, for better or for worse, with the sweetest ones; he knows how the soul wearily drags itself along when it can no longer leap and fly, nor even walk; he has the shy glance of concealed pain, of understanding without solace, of taking farewell without confession; yes, as the Orpheus31 of all secret misery he is greater than anyone, and he has incorporated into art some things that seemed inexpressible and even unworthy of art, and which could only be scared away and not be grasped by words in particular – some very small and microscopic features of the soul: yes, he is master at the very small. But he doesn’t &lt;em&gt;want&lt;/em&gt; to be! His &lt;em&gt;character&lt;/em&gt; likes great walls and bold frescoes much better! It escapes him that his &lt;em&gt;spirit&lt;/em&gt; has a different taste and disposition and likes best of all to sit quietly in the corners of collapsed houses – there, hidden, hidden from himself, he paints his real masterpieces, which are all very short, often only a bar long – only there does he become wholly good, great, and perfect; perhaps only there. – But he doesn’t know it! He is too vain to know it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Being serious about truth.&lt;/em&gt; – Being serious about truth! How differently people understand these words! The very same opinions and types of proof and scrutiny that a thinker may consider a frivolity in himself to which he has, to his shame, succumbed on this or that occasion – these very same views may give an artist who encounters them and lives with them for a while the feeling that he has now become deeply serious about truth and that it is admirable that he, as an artist, has at the same time the most serious desire for the opposite of appearance. So it can happen that it is precisely with his ardent seriousness that someone betrays how shallow and undemanding his mind has been in playing the field of knowledge so far. – And does not everything that we take to be &lt;em&gt;important&lt;/em&gt; betray us? It shows us what sort of thing has weight for us and for what sort of thing we have no weights.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Now and formerly.&lt;/em&gt; – What do all our art of artworks matter if we lose that higher art, the art of festivals! Formerly, all artworks were displayed on the great festival road of humanity, as commemorations and memorials of high and happy moments. Now one uses artworks to lure poor, exhausted, and sick human beings to the side of humanity’s road of suffering for a short lascivious moment; one offers them a little intoxication and madness.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The trembling became more convulsive, the light on the screen more erratic. The sound grew loud, but, we knew, it was not the immense sound Leviathan might make when it arrived.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;“Captain,” said Redleigh. “Permission to turn back. We’ll be destroyed.”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;“Head on, Mr. Redleigh,” said the captain. “It’s merely testing us.”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The storm on the screen rose and fell and rose again.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;When he looked up, Nef’s chair was empty. The other diners, too, had all left the table, gone back to their rocking chairs or, perhaps, to summer afternoon naps.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;“Lord,” he murmured. “That woman, young, but how young? Old, but how old?”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Suddenly Elias Culpepper touched his elbow.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;“You want a real tour of our town? Claude needs to deliver some more fresh-baked bread. On your feet!”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The wagon was loaded with a redolent harvest. The warm loaves had been neatly stacked row on row within the oven-smelling wagon, thirty or forty loaves in all, with names lettered on the wax-paper wrappings. Beside these were waxed boxes of muffins and cakes, carefully tied with string.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Upon this theological instinct I make war: I find the tracks of it everywhere. Whoever has theological blood in his veins is shifty and dishonourable in all things. The pathetic thing that grows out of this condition is called &lt;em&gt;faith&lt;/em&gt;: in other words, closing one’s eyes upon one’s self once for all, to avoid suffering the sight of incurable falsehood. People erect a concept of morality, of virtue, of holiness upon this false view of all things; they ground good conscience upon faulty vision; they argue that no &lt;em&gt;other&lt;/em&gt; sort of vision has value any more, once they have made theirs sacrosanct with the names of “God,” “salvation” and “eternity.” I unearth this theological instinct in all directions: it is the most widespread and the most &lt;em&gt;subterranean&lt;/em&gt; form of falsehood to be found on earth. Whatever a theologian regards as true &lt;em&gt;must&lt;/em&gt; be false: there you have almost a criterion of truth. His profound instinct of self-preservation stands against truth ever coming into honour in any way, or even getting stated. Wherever the influence of theologians is felt there is a transvaluation of values, and the concepts “true” and “false” are forced to change places: whatever is most damaging to life is there called “true,” and whatever exalts it, intensifies it, approves it, justifies it and makes it triumphant is there called “false.”&amp;hellip; When theologians, working through the “consciences” of princes (or of peoples—), stretch out their hands for &lt;em&gt;power&lt;/em&gt;, there is never any doubt as to the fundamental issue: the will to make an end, the &lt;em&gt;nihilistic&lt;/em&gt; will exerts that power&amp;hellip;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Our eruptions.&lt;/em&gt; – Countless things that humanity acquired in earlier stages, but so feebly and embryonically that no one could tell that they had been acquired, suddenly emerge into the light much later, perhaps after centuries; meanwhile they have become strong and ripe. Some ages seem to lack completely some talent or virtue, just as some people do: but just wait for their children and grandchildren, if you have time to wait – they bring to light the inner qualities of their grandfathers, the qualities that their grandfathers themselves did not know about. Often it is already the son that betrays his father: the father understands himself better once he has a son. All of us harbour in ourselves hidden gardens and plantations; and, to use another metaphor, we are all growing volcanoes approaching their hour of eruption; how near or distant that is, of course, nobody knows, not even the good Lord.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

In German the &lt;em&gt;v&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;f&lt;/em&gt; are both pronounced as &lt;em&gt;f&lt;/em&gt; adding alliteration to this name and the title Nietzsche makes of it. ‘Prince Vogelfrei’ here functions as Nietzsche’s &lt;em&gt;nom de guerre&lt;/em&gt; or pseudonym.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;HAD I KNOWN THEN what I know now of Vimalananda&amp;rsquo;s Junior Guru Maharaj I would have concluded that in the act of awarding him the tran sient felicity of Redstone&amp;rsquo;s win Guru Maharaj had successfully stolen one of the few remaining joys from Vimalananda&amp;rsquo;s life. Vimalananda, who must have suspected it all along, tried unsuccessfully to reveal this to me not long after the taxi-driver episode, during the course of an afternoon spent at Bhuleshwar. After offering our worship we sat resting inside the front pas sageway when Vimalananada looked me over in a unusually peculiar way and said, &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;ve told you before about Lord Krishna and His siddhi of Kartum, Akartum, Anyathakartum.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

These organs are made to move by the ego alone. They can take you to the heights of success if they are controlled, and if they are misused &lt;em&gt;—&lt;/em&gt; if you make just a single mistake in your sadhana &lt;em&gt;—&lt;/em&gt; down you go, divebombing like a Stuka.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Even though the chakras of the subtle body have been identified by other cultures, such as the ancient Egyptian and the Navajo, they have never been directly introduced into popular religion, for good reason. Having our Kun dalinis unawakened and our chakras closed is a form of protection; exist ence is possible for embodied beings solely because their chakras are&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;1831&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;AGHORA II: Kundalini&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;normally blocked. In fact, many Kundalini-generated disorders are due not to the blockage of a chakra but to the lack of blockage thereof. The delusion that the chakras are the cause of physiological imbalances stems from the confusion that exists between the chakras themselves and the other struc tures that exist in association with them. The chakras mentioned above, the Muladhara and the rest, function only when Kundalini moves within them; at all other times what functions are their corresponding but more superfi cial structures.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;‘DAYBREAK’ is an affirmative book, profound but bright and benevolent. The same applies once again and in the highest degree to the &lt;em&gt;gaya scienza:&lt;/em&gt; in practically every sentence of this book profundity and exuberance go hand in hand. A poem which expresses gratitude for the most wonderful month of January I have ever experienced – the entire book is a gift – betrays out of what a depth ‘science’ has here become &lt;em&gt;gay:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Caution.&lt;/em&gt; – As is well known, Alfieri32 lied very much when he told his amazed contemporaries his life story. He lied from that despotism against himself which he also revealed in the way he created his own language and tyrannized himself into becoming a poet – he had finally found a severe form of sublimity into which he &lt;em&gt;pressed&lt;/em&gt; his life and his memory: no doubt there was much agony in all this. – I also would not believe a life story of Plato, written by himself – any more than that of Rousseau33 or the &lt;em&gt;vita nuova&lt;/em&gt;34 of Dante.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Prose and poetry.&lt;/em&gt; – It is remarkable that the great masters of prose have almost always also been poets, be it publicly or only in secret, in the ‘closet’; and verily, one writes good prose only &lt;em&gt;face to face with poetry!&lt;/em&gt; For this is an uninterrupted, courteous war with poetry: all its attractions depend on the fact that poetry is constantly evaded and contradicted; everything abstract wants to be presented as a prank against poetry and as if with a mocking voice; everything dry and cool is supposed to drive the lovely goddess into lovely despair; often there are &lt;em&gt;rapprochements,&lt;/em&gt; reconciliations for a moment, and then a sudden leap back and derisive laugh; often the curtain is raised and a harsh light is let in just as the goddess is enjoying her dusks and muted colours; often the word is taken out of her mouth and sung according to a melody that makes her cover her refined ears with her refined hands – and so there are a thousand delights of this war, including defeat, of which the unpoetic, the so-called men of prose, know nothing at all – which is why they write and speak only bad prose! *War is the father of all good things;*35 war is also the father of good prose! In this century, four very strange and truly poetic persons attained a mastery of prose, for which this century is otherwise not made – out of a lack of poetry, as I have suggested. Excluding Goethe, who may fairly be claimed by the century that produced him, I see Giacomo Leopardi, Prosper Mérimée, Ralph Waldo Emerson, and Walter Savage Landor, the author of &lt;em&gt;Imaginary Conversations&lt;/em&gt;,36 as worthy of being called masters of prose.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;But then why do you write?&lt;/em&gt; – A: I am not one of those who &lt;em&gt;think&lt;/em&gt; with a wet quill in hand; much less one of those who abandon themselves to their passions right before the open inkwell, sitting on their chair and staring at the paper. I am annoyed or ashamed by all writing; to me, writing is nature’s call – to speak of it even in simile is repugnant to me. B: But why, then, do you write? – A: Well, my friend, I say this in confidence: until now I have found no other means of getting &lt;em&gt;rid&lt;/em&gt; of my thoughts. – B: And why do you want to get rid of them? – A: Why do I want to?

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Growth after death.&lt;/em&gt; – Those audacious little words about moral matters that Fontenelle threw out in his immortal &lt;em&gt;Dialogues of the Dead&lt;/em&gt;37 were considered in his time to be paradoxes and games of a not wholly innocent wit; even the highest judges of taste and of the mind saw nothing more in it – indeed, maybe not even Fontenelle himself. Now something incredible transpires: these thoughts become truths! Science proves them! The game gets serious! And we read these dialogues with a different feeling than Voltaire38 and Helvétius39 read them, and involuntarily we promote their creators to a different and &lt;em&gt;much higher&lt;/em&gt; rank of mind than they did.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Chamfort.40&lt;/em&gt; – That someone who knew humanity and the masses as well as Chamfort still joined the masses and did not stand aside in philosophical renunciation and defence, I can only explain as follows: one instinct in him was stronger than his wisdom and was never satisfied: his hatred of all nobility of blood; perhaps his mother’s old hatred, which was only too easy to explain and which he had sanctified through love of his mother – an instinct for revenge harking back to his boyhood, waiting for the hour to avenge his mother. And now his life and his genius – and alas! no doubt mostly the paternal blood in his veins – had seduced him to join the ranks of this nobility as an equal, for many, many years! But eventually he could no longer stand the sight of himself, the sight of the ‘old type of man’ under the old regime; he was gripped with a violent passion of repentance which led him to put on the clothes of the mob, as &lt;em&gt;his&lt;/em&gt; kind of hairshirt! His bad conscience was his failure to take revenge. If Chamfort had remained just a little bit more a philosopher, the Revolution would not have had its tragic wit and sharpest sting: it would be considered a much stupider event and would not seduce so many minds. But Chamfort’s hatred and revenge educated a whole generation, and the most illustrious human beings passed through this school. Note that Mirabeau41 looked up to Chamfort as to his higher and older self from which he expected and endured impulses, warnings, and verdicts – Mirabeau, who as a human being belongs to a quite different order of greatness than even the foremost statesmen of yesterday and today. It is peculiar that despite such a friend and advocate – after all, we have Mirabeau’s letters to Chamfort – this wittiest of all moralists has remained a stranger to the French, no less than Stendhal,42 who has perhaps had the most thoughtful eyes and ears of all Frenchmen of &lt;em&gt;this&lt;/em&gt; century. Is it that the latter basically had too much of the Dutchman or Englishman within himself to be tolerable to the Parisians? Whereas Chamfort, a man who was rich in depths and backgrounds of the soul – gloomy, suffering, ardent – a thinker who found laughter necessary as a remedy against life and who nearly considered himself lost on those days when he had not laughed – seems much more like an Italian, related to Dante and Leopardi, than a Frenchman! We know Chamfort’s last words: ‘Ah! mon ami’, he said to Sieyès,43 ‘je m’en vais enfin de ce monde, ou il faut que le creur se brise ou se bronze –’.44 Those are surely not the words of a dying Frenchman.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Two speakers.&lt;/em&gt; – Of these two speakers, the one can show the full rationality of his cause only when he abandons himself to passion: this alone pumps enough blood and heat into his brain to force his lofty intellect to reveal itself. The other attempts the same thing now and then – to present his cause with the help of passion, sonorously, violently, and captivatingly – but usually with little success. He then quite soon starts speaking obscurely and confusedly; he exaggerates, makes omissions, and arouses mistrust about the rationality of his cause; indeed, he himself comes to feel this mistrust, and this explains sudden leaps into the coldest and most repugnant tones which make the audience doubt whether his whole passion was genuine. In his case, passion inundates the mind every time – maybe because it is stronger than in the first speaker. But he is at the peak of his strength when he resists the pressing storm of his feeling and virtually derides it: only then does his mind completely step out of its hiding place – a logical, mocking, playful, and yet terrifying mind.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;On the garrulousness of writers.&lt;/em&gt; – There is a garrulousness of rage – frequent in Luther, also in Schopenhauer. A garrulousness due to an exceedingly large supply of conceptual formulations, as in Kant. A garrulousness due to a delight in ever-new twists of the same thing: one finds this in Montaigne. A garrulousness of spiteful natures: whoever reads the publications of our time will recall two writers here. A garrulousness from a delight in good words and forms of language: not rare in Goethe’s prose. A garrulousness from an inner pleasure in noise and confusion of feelings: for example in Carlyle.45&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;In praise of Shakespeare.&lt;/em&gt; – The most beautiful thing I can say in praise of Shakespeare &lt;em&gt;as a human being&lt;/em&gt; is this: he believed in Brutus and didn’t cast a speck of suspicion on this type of virtue! To him he devoted his best tragedy – it is still called by the wrong name46 – to him and to the most dreadful epitome of lofty morality. Independence of soul! That’s what’s at stake here! No sacrifice can be too great for that: one has to be capable of sacrificing even one’s dearest friend for it, even if he should be the most marvellous human being, the ornament of the world, the genius without peer – if one loves freedom as the freedom of great souls and &lt;em&gt;this&lt;/em&gt; freedom is endangered because of him: that is what Shakespeare must have felt! The height at which he places Caesar is the finest honour he could bestow on Brutus: only thus does he raise Brutus’ inner problem to immense proportions as well as the strength of mind that was able to cut &lt;em&gt;this&lt;/em&gt; knot! And was it really political freedom that drove this poet to sympathize with Brutus – and turned him into Brutus’ accomplice? Or was political freedom only a symbolism for something inexpressible? Could it be that we confront some unknown dark event and adventure from the poet’s own soul about which he wanted to speak only in signs? What is all of Hamlet’s melancholy compared to that of Brutus! And perhaps Shakespeare knew the latter as he knew the former – through first-hand experience! Maybe he also had his dark hour and his evil angel, like Brutus! But whatever such similarities and secret references there may have been: before the whole figure and virtue of Brutus, Shakespeare threw himself to the ground and felt unworthy and distant – he wrote the evidence for this into his tragedy. Twice in the tragedy he introduced a poet,47 and twice he poured such impatient and ultimate contempt upon him that it sounds like a cry – like the cry of self-contempt. Brutus, even Brutus loses patience when the poet enters – conceited, pathetic, obtrusive, as poets usually are – as a being who appears to be bursting with possibilities of greatness, even moral greatness, although in the philosophy of deed and life he rarely attains even a passable integrity. ‘When he knows his time, &lt;em&gt;I’ll know his humour.&lt;/em&gt; / What should the wars do with these jiggling fools? / Companion, hence!’48 shouts Brutus. This should be translated back into the soul of the poet who wrote it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Schopenhauer’s followers.&lt;/em&gt; – What happens when people of a higher culture and barbarians come into contact: the lower culture usually takes on the vices, weaknesses, and excesses of the higher culture, on which basis it feels a certain attraction to that culture and finally, by way of the acquired vices and weaknesses, accepts some overflow of the valuable force of the higher culture – one can also observe this nearby and without travelling to barbarian peoples, to be sure in a form that is somewhat over-refined and intellectualized and not so easily palpable. And what do &lt;em&gt;Schopenhauer’s&lt;/em&gt; German followers usually take over at first from their master? In relation to his higher culture, they must feel barbarous enough to be at first barbarously fascinated and seduced by him. Is it his sense for hard facts, his good will to clarity and reason, that so often makes him appear so English and so un-German? Or is it the strength of his intellectual conscience, which &lt;em&gt;endured&lt;/em&gt; a life-long contradiction between being and willing and forced him to contradict himself continually and on almost every point in his writings? Or is it his cleanliness in matters of the church and of the Christian god? – for here his cleanliness was unprecedented among German philosophers, so that he lived and died ‘as a Voltairean’.49 Or was it his immortal doctrine of the intellectuality of intuition, of the a priori nature of the causal law, of the instrumental nature of the intellect and the unfreedom of the will?50 No, all this does not enchant and is not felt to be enchanting; but Schopenhauer’s mystical embarrassments and evasions in those places where the factual thinker let himself be seduced and corrupted by the vain urge to be the unriddler of the world; the indemonstrable doctrine of &lt;em&gt;One Will&lt;/em&gt; (‘all causes are merely occasional causes of the appearance of the will at this time and this place’; ‘the will to life is present wholly and undividedly in every being, even the least, as completely as in all beings that have ever been, are, and shall be, taken together’),51 the &lt;em&gt;denial of the individual&lt;/em&gt; (‘all lions are at bottom only one lion’; ‘the plurality of individuals is an illusion’,52 just as &lt;em&gt;development&lt;/em&gt; is only an illusion – he calls Lamarck’s thoughts ‘an ingenious, absurd error’),53 his ecstatic reveries on &lt;em&gt;genius&lt;/em&gt; (‘in aesthetic intuition the individual is no longer individual but pure, will-less, painless, timeless subject of knowledge’; ‘the subject, in being wholly taken up in the object it intuits, has become the object itself’),54 the nonsense about &lt;em&gt;compassion&lt;/em&gt; and how, as the source of all morality, it enables one to make the break through the *principium individuationis;*55 and also such claims as ‘death is actually the purpose of existence’,56 ‘one cannot deny &lt;em&gt;a priori&lt;/em&gt; the possibility that a magical effect cannot also emanate from someone who has already died’ – these and other such &lt;em&gt;excesses&lt;/em&gt; and vices of the philosopher are always what is accepted first of all and made into a matter of faith – for vices and excesses are the easiest to imitate and require no extensive preparatory practice. But let us discuss the most famous of living Schopenhauerians, Richard Wagner. What happened to him has happened to other artists: he misinterpreted the characters he created and misunderstood the philosophy that was implicit in his own art. Until the middle of his life, Richard Wagner let himself be misled by Hegel; he repeated this mistake when he started reading Schopenhauer’s doctrine into his characters and began expressing himself in terms of ‘will’, ‘genius’, and ‘compassion’. Nevertheless it will remain true that nothing goes so directly against the spirit of Schopenhauer as what is genuinely Wagnerian in Wagner’s heroes: I mean the innocence of the utmost selfishness; the faith in great passion as the good in itself, in a word, what is Siegfried-like57 in the countenances of his heroes. ‘All of this smells even more like Spinoza than like me’, Schopenhauer might say. Although Wagner would have good reason to look for some other philosopher than Schopenhauer, the enchantment to which he succumbed with regard to this thinker has blinded him not only to other philosophers but also to science; his entire art increasingly wants to present itself as a companion piece and supplement to Schopenhauer’s philosophy, and with increasing explicitness it renounces the loftier ambition of becoming a companion piece and supplement to human knowledge and science. And not only is it the whole secretive splendour of this philosophy – which would also have attracted a Cagliostro58 – that draws him to this, but the particular gestures and affects of the philosophers were always seducers as well! Wagner is Schopenhauerian, for example, in his exasperation over the corruption of the German language;59 even, however, if one should approve of Wagner’s imitation of Schopenhauer in this point, one must not conceal the fact that Wagner’s style itself suffers rather seriously from all those ulcers and tumours whose sight so enraged Schopenhauer. Regarding the Wagnerians who write German, Wagnerianism is starting to prove as dangerous as any Hegelianism ever has. Wagner is Schopenhauerian in his hatred of the Jews, to whom he is unable to do justice even in their greatest deed; after all, the Jews are the inventors of Christianity.60 Wagner is Schopenhauerian in his attempt to conceive of Christianity as a seed of Buddhism that has drifted far and to prepare a Buddhistic age for Europe, with an occasional reconciliation with Catholic-Christian formulas and sentiments.61 Wagner is Schopenhauerian when he preaches mercy in our relations with animals; as we know, Schopenhauer’s predecessor in this was Voltaire, who may also, like his successors, have known to disguise his hatred of certain things and persons as mercy towards animals.62 At least Wagner’s hatred of science, which finds expression in his preaching, certainly does not come from a spirit of mercy and goodness – any more, obviously, than it does from any &lt;em&gt;spirit&lt;/em&gt; at all. In the end, the philosophy of an artist is of little significance if it is merely an afterthought (&lt;em&gt;eine nachträgliche Philosophie&lt;/em&gt;) and does not harm the art itself. One cannot be too careful to avoid bearing ill will against an artist for an occasional, perhaps very unfortunate and presumptuous masquerade; let us not forget that, without exception, our dear artists are to some extent actors and have to be, and that without acting they would hardly be able to hold out very long. Let us remain faithful to Wagner in what is &lt;em&gt;true&lt;/em&gt; and original in him – and especially, as his disciples, by remaining faithful to ourselves in what is true and original in us. Let us leave him his intellectual tempers and cramps; let us, in all fairness, ask what strange kinds of nourishment and needs an art like his may &lt;em&gt;require&lt;/em&gt; in order to be able to live and grow! It doesn’t matter that as a thinker he is so often wrong; justice and patience are not for him. Enough that his life is justified before itself and remains justified – this life which shouts at every one of us: ‘Be a man and do not follow me – but yourself! Yourself!’63 &lt;em&gt;Our&lt;/em&gt; life, too, shall be justified before ourselves! We too shall freely and fearlessly, in innocent selfishness, grow and blossom from ourselves! And as I contemplate such a person, the following sentences still come to mind today as they did before: ‘That passion is better than Stoicism and hypocrisy; that being honest even in evil is better than losing oneself to the morality of tradition; that the free man can be good as well as evil, but the unfree man is a disgrace to nature and has no share in heavenly or earthly comfort; finally that &lt;em&gt;everyone who wants to be free must become so through himself,&lt;/em&gt; and that freedom does not fall into anyone’s lap as a wondrous gift’ (&lt;em&gt;Richard Wagner in Bayreuth,&lt;/em&gt; p. 94).64&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This book might need more than one preface; and in the end there would still be room for doubting whether someone who has not experienced something similar could, by means of prefaces, be brought closer to the &lt;em&gt;experiences&lt;/em&gt; of this book. It seems to be written in the language of the wind that brings a thaw: it contains high spirits, unrest, contradiction, and April weather, so that one is constantly reminded of winter’s nearness as well as of the &lt;em&gt;triumph&lt;/em&gt; over winter that is coming, must come, perhaps has already come&amp;hellip;Gratitude flows forth incessantly, as if that which was most unexpected had just happened – the gratitude of a convalescent – for &lt;em&gt;recovery&lt;/em&gt; was what was most unexpected. ‘Gay Science’: this signifies the saturnalia1 of a mind that has patiently resisted a terrible, long pressure – patiently, severely, coldly, without yielding, but also without hope – and is now all of a sudden attacked by hope, by hope for health, by the &lt;em&gt;intoxication&lt;/em&gt; of recovery. Is it any wonder that in the process much that is unreasonable and foolish comes to light, much wanton tenderness, lavished even on problems that have a prickly hide, not made to be fondled and lured? This entire book is really nothing but an amusement after long privation and powerlessness, the jubilation of returning strength, of a reawakened faith in a tomorrow and a day after tomorrow, of a sudden sense and anticipation of a future, of impending adventures, of reopened seas, of goals that are permitted and believed in again. How many and what sorts of things did not lie behind me then! This stretch of desert, exhaustion, loss of faith, icing-up in the midst of youth; this onset of dotage at the wrong time; this tyranny of pain surpassed still by the tyranny of a pride that refused the &lt;em&gt;conclusions&lt;/em&gt; of pain – and conclusions are consolations; this radical seclusion as a self-defence against a pathologically clairvoyant contempt for humanity, this limitation in principle to what was bitter, harsh, painful to know, as prescribed by the &lt;em&gt;nausea&lt;/em&gt; that had gradually developed from an incautious and excessively luxurious spiritual diet – one calls it romanticism – oh, who could re-experience all of this as I did? But if anyone could, he would surely pardon even more than a bit of foolishness, exuberance, ‘gay science’ – for example, the handful of songs that have been added to the book this time, songs in which a poet makes fun of all poets in a manner that is hard to forgive. Alas, it is not only the poets and their beautiful ‘lyrical sentiments’ on whom this resurrected author has to vent his malice: who knows what kind of victim he is looking for, what kind of monster will stimulate him to pardon it? &lt;em&gt;Incipit tragoedia&lt;/em&gt;,2 we read at the end of this suspiciously innocent book. Beware! Something utterly wicked and mischievous is being announced here: *incipit parodia,*3 no doubt.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Exposure to the Tantric Path&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Chapter One&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In that little town under the foothills of the western ghat in Kerala, there was just one real building which was a small temple with a tile roofing. The temple was surrounded by huts and shanties. When I arrived, there was a competition going on in the market place between two tantrics who had selected an onlooker from the crowd to be their medium. They had him standing stiff as a bamboo in trance. One tantric pointed a stick at him and said “lay down” he fell flat! The other pointed and said “get up” he rose up straight without bending a limb!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;When I received from the Board of Historical Studies at Cambridge the invitation to deliver a course of lectures, specially intended for the candidates for the Indian Civil Service, I hesitated for some time, feeling extremely doubtful whether in a few public discourses I could say anything that would be of real use to them in passing their examinations. To enable young men to pass their examinations seems now to have become the chief, if not the only object of the universities; and to no class of students is it of greater importance to pass their examinations, and to pass them well, than to the candidates for the Indian Civil Service.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Among Germans I am immediately understood when I say that theological blood is the ruin of philosophy. The Protestant pastor is the grandfather of German philosophy; Protestantism itself is its &lt;em&gt;peccatum originale&lt;/em&gt;. Definition of Protestantism: hemiplegic paralysis of Christianity—&lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; of reason&amp;hellip;. One need only utter the words “Tübingen School” to get an understanding of what German philosophy is at bottom—a very artful form of theology&amp;hellip;. The Suabians are the best liars in Germany; they lie innocently&amp;hellip;. Why all the rejoicing over the appearance of Kant that went through the learned world of Germany, three-fourths of which is made up of the sons of preachers and teachers—why the German conviction still echoing, that with Kant came a change for the &lt;em&gt;better&lt;/em&gt;? The theological instinct of German scholars made them see clearly just &lt;em&gt;what&lt;/em&gt; had become possible again&amp;hellip;. A backstairs leading to the old ideal stood open; the concept of the “true world,” the concept of morality as the &lt;em&gt;essence&lt;/em&gt; of the world (—the two most vicious errors that ever existed!), were once more, thanks to a subtle and wily scepticism, if not actually demonstrable, then &lt;em&gt;at least&lt;/em&gt; no longer &lt;em&gt;refutable&lt;/em&gt;&amp;hellip;. &lt;em&gt;Reason&lt;/em&gt;, the &lt;em&gt;prerogative&lt;/em&gt; of reason, does not go so far&amp;hellip;. Out of reality there had been made “appearance”; an absolutely false world, that of being, had been turned into reality&amp;hellip;. The success of Kant is merely a theological success; he was, like Luther and Leibnitz, but one more impediment to German integrity, already far from steady.—&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A kind of atavism.&lt;/em&gt; – I prefer to understand the rare human beings of an age as suddenly appearing, late ghosts of past cultures and their powers: as atavisms of a people and its mores – that way one can really &lt;em&gt;understand&lt;/em&gt; something about them! They now seem strange, rare, extraordinary; and whoever feels these powers in himself must nurse, defend, honor, and cultivate them against another world that resists them: and so he becomes either a great human being or a mad and eccentric one, unless he perishes too soon. Formerly, these same qualities were common and therefore considered ordinary: they weren’t distinguishing. They were perhaps demanded, presupposed; it was impossible to become great through them, if only because there was also no danger of becoming mad and lonely through them. It is principally in the generations and castes that &lt;em&gt;conserve&lt;/em&gt; a people that we find such recrudescences of old instincts, while such atavism is highly improbable where races, habits, and valuations change too rapidly. For tempo is as significant a power in the development of peoples as in music: in our case, what is absolutely necessary is an &lt;em&gt;andante&lt;/em&gt; of development, as the tempo of a passionate and slow spirit – and that is after all what the spirit of conservative generations is like.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;THE FACTS OF VIMALANANDA&amp;rsquo;S dying are as easy to recount as they were tortuous to live through. Somehow I succeeded at cremating him at Bombay&amp;rsquo;s Banganga Smashan, just as eight years and three months previously he had prophesied that I would. And, just as he had promised all those years ago, his wife and children did not come to watch the pyre, for their egos still smarted from his failure to attend his daughter&amp;rsquo;s wedding. As the flames devoured him the mournful tones of his last request—“Precious Lord, Take My Hand,&amp;quot; sung by Jim Reeves&amp;ndash;ascended toward the heavens with the smoke. I kept rewinding the tape until when it finally snapped I concluded that he had had enough. Thereafter I sat silently, dreading the moment that the fire would die down and I would have to leave Vimalananda&amp;rsquo;s hands be hind me for good.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Human beings are nothing but sheep. I used to be in the flock of sheep, but I ran away, so it’s no surprise that everyone else, all the so-called normal people, thinks I’m insane or, at the least, abnormal. And I think the same about them. Only one of us can be right.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;GIRNAR&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I’ve always believed that when you do a thing you should forget everything else and do that one thing with heart and soul. When I was interested in mundane pursuits I was a perfect materialist. You would never in your life have imagined that I could be interested in spiritual subjects. And when I was doing sadhana, I forgot everything else and I did it. For example, for ten months in Girnar I lived in an Arka &lt;em&gt;(Calotropis gigantea)&lt;/em&gt; tree in an old cemetery, eating only Arka leaves, doing a ritual to please Anjaneya. Arka leaves cause violent purging and vomiting. Do you know how “hot” Arka is? &lt;em&gt;Arka&lt;/em&gt; means “sun” and after two or three days of eating those leaves my mouth and tongue had swollen to twice their normal size. But that didn’t stop me; I continued with the ritual. Aghoris always overdo a thing.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A pleasing routine developed when Vimalananda visited Poona&amp;rsquo;s Trani colony. I would come over early to help prepare lunch, and then would go off to college in the afternoon. In the evenings we would go to the stables to visit his “four-legged children,” and on race days I would accompany him into the stands at the racecourse. After returning home we would sit together until late at night while he discoursed on spiritual subjects.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The fourth, fifth and sixth chapters of the book of I Samuel describe the capture by the Philistines and the eventual return to Israel of the Ark of the&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;[84]&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;KUNDALINI&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Covenant. While it is difficult to draw direct correlations between otherwise unrelated ancient cultures, it is striking to note that during the period that the Philistines possessed the Ark the idol of their god Dagon was mysteri ously toppled and disfigured, and the entire population was struck low with hemorrhoids. It would certainly seem that neither the Philistines nor their god could digest the Ark&amp;rsquo;s shakti. When they consulted their diviners they were told to return the Ark to Israel with a trespass offering consisting of five golden hemorrhoids and five mice, also made of gold. Is it a coincidence that hemorrhoids appear in the physical body near the location of the Muladhara Chakra, or that the mouse is the vehicle of Ganesha, the Lord of the Muladhara? Or does this imagery reflect similar subtle realities?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>10 THUS SPOKE ZARATHUSTRA</title>
      <link>https://vishvAsa.github.io/english/prose/nietzsche/ecce_homo/10_THUS_SPOKE_ZARATHUSTRA/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A Book for Everyone and No One&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;1&#34;&gt;1&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I SHALL now tell the story of Zarathustra. The basic conception of the work, the &lt;em&gt;idea of eternal recurrence,&lt;/em&gt; the highest formula of affirmation that can possibly be attained − belongs to the August of the year 1881: it was jotted down on a piece of paper with the inscription: ‘6,000 feet beyond man and time’. I was that day walking through the woods beside the lake of Silva-plana; I stopped beside a mighty pyramidal block of stone which reared itself up not far from Surlei. Then this idea came to me. − If I reckon a couple of months back from this day I find as an omen a sudden and profoundly decisive alteration in my taste, above all in music. The whole of Zarathustra might perhaps be reckoned as music; − certainly a rebirth of the art of &lt;em&gt;hearing&lt;/em&gt; was a precondition of it. In a little mountain resort not far from Vicenza, Recoaro, where I spent the spring of the year 1881, I discovered together with my &lt;em&gt;maestro&lt;/em&gt; and friend Peter Gast, who was likewise ‘reborn’, that the phoenix music flew past us with lighter and more luminous wings than it had ever exhibited before. If on the other hand I reckon from that day forwards to the sudden delivery accomplished under the most improbable circumstances in February 1883 − the closing section, from which I have quoted a couple of sentences in the &lt;em&gt;Foreword,&lt;/em&gt; was completed precisely at that sacred hour when Richard Wagner died in Venice − the pregnancy is seen to have lasted eighteen months. This term of precisely eighteen months might suggest, at least to Buddhists, that I am really a female elephant. − The interval is occupied by the &lt;em&gt;‘gaya scienza’,&lt;/em&gt; which bears a hundred signs of the proximity of something incomparable; finally it gives the opening of Zarathustra itself, it gives in the penultimate piece of the fourth book the fundamental idea of Zarathustra. − Also belonging to this interval is that &lt;em&gt;Hymn to Life&lt;/em&gt; (for mixed chorus and orchestra) the score of which was published two years ago by E. W. Fritzsch of Leipzig: a perhaps not insignificant symptom of the condition of this year, when I was possessed to the highest degree by the &lt;em&gt;affirmative&lt;/em&gt; pathos &lt;em&gt;par excellence,&lt;/em&gt; which I call the tragic pathos. It will one day be sung to my memory. − The text, I may state expressly because a misunderstanding exists about it, is not by me: it is the astonishing inspiration of a young Russian lady with whom I was then friendly, Fräulein Lou von Salomé. He who knows how to extract any meaning at all from the closing words of the poem will divine why I preferred and admired it: they possess greatness. Pain does &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; count as an objection to life: ‘Have you no more happiness to give me, well then! &lt;em&gt;still do you have your pain…’ Perhaps my music is also great at this point.&lt;/em&gt; [&lt;em&gt;Last note&lt;/em&gt; of the clarinet in A is &lt;em&gt;C sharp&lt;/em&gt; not &lt;em&gt;C.&lt;/em&gt; Printing error.) − I lived the following winter in the pleasandy quiet bay of Rapallo not far from Genoa which cuts in between Chiavari and the promontory of Porto Fino. My health was not of the best; the winter cold and exceedingly wet; a small &lt;em&gt;albergo&lt;/em&gt; situated right against the sea, so that at night the high tide made sleep impossible, offered all in all the very opposite of what one might desire. In spite of this, and almost as a proof of my proposition that everything decisive comes about ‘in spite of, it was during this winter and under these unfavourable conditions that my Zarathustra came into existence. − In the mornings I climbed in a southerly direction into the heights along the glorious route to Zoagli, past pine-trees and with a vast view of the sea; in the afternoons, whenever my health permitted I walked around the entire bay from Santa Margherita to Porto Fino. This place and this landscape is even closer to my heart through the great love Kaiser Friedrich the Third felt for it; in the autumn of 1886 I happened to be on this coast again when he visited this little forgotten world of happiness for the last time. − It was on these two walks that the whole of the first Zarathustra came to me, above all Zarathustra himself, as a type: more accurately, &lt;em&gt;be stole up on me…&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Learning how to pay homage.&lt;/em&gt; – Men have to learn to pay homage just as they have to learn to feel contempt. Anyone who breaks new paths and has led many people onto new paths discovers with amazement how clumsy and poor those many are at expressing their gratitude; indeed, how seldom gratitude &lt;em&gt;is able&lt;/em&gt; to express itself at all. It is as though whenever gratitude wants to speak, something gets caught in her throat so that she just clears her throat and falls silent clearing her throat. The way in which a thinker comes to sense the effects of his thoughts and their reorganizing and unsettling power is almost a comedy; it seems at times as if those who have been affected basically feel insulted and can only express what they take to be their threatened independence through a welter of incivilities. Entire generations are needed to invent merely a polite convention for thanks; and only very late comes that time when even gratitude has acquired a kind of spirit and genius; by then, someone is usually also around to be the great recipient of the gratitude, not only for what good he himself has done, but mostly for what his predecessors have slowly heaped up as a treasure of the highest and best.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;*Voltaire.*65 – Wherever there was a court, there were laws of good speech and thus also laws of style for all who wrote. The language of the court, however, is the language of the courtier, &lt;em&gt;who has no area of expertise&lt;/em&gt; and who forbids himself convenient technical expressions even in conversation about scientific matters because they smack of areas of expertise; that is why, in countries with a courtly culture, technical expressions and everything that betrays a specialist is considered a &lt;em&gt;stylistic blemish.&lt;/em&gt; Now that all courts have become caricatures of past and present, one is amazed to find even Voltaire unspeakably inflexible and punctilious on this point (for example in his judgement of such stylists as Fontenelle66and Montesquieu67) – for we are all emancipated from courtly taste, while Voltaire &lt;em&gt;perfected&lt;/em&gt; it!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A word to the philologists.&lt;/em&gt; – That there are books so valuable and regal that entire generations of scholars are well employed when, through their efforts, these books are preserved in a pure and intelligible state – philology exists to reinforce this faith again and again. It presupposes that there is no dearth of those rare human beings (even if one doesn’t see them right away) who really know how to use such valuable books – probably those who themselves write or could write such books. I mean that philology presupposes a noble faith – that for the sake of a few who always ‘will come’ but are not there, a very great deal of painstaking, even unclean work first needs to be done: it is all work &lt;em&gt;in usum Delphinorum&lt;/em&gt;.68&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;On German music.&lt;/em&gt; – Today German music is, more than any other, the music of Europe only because it alone has given expression to the transformation that Europe underwent through the Revolution: only German composers know how to lend expression to animated masses of people; how to create that enormous artificial noise that doesn’t even have to be very loud – whereas for example Italian opera knows only choruses of servants or soldiers, but not ‘people’.69 Moreover, in all German music one can hear a deep bourgeois envy of nobility, especially of &lt;em&gt;esprit&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;élégance&lt;/em&gt; as expressions of a courtly, knightly, old, self-assured society. This music is not like that of Goethe’s singer before the gate, which also pleases ‘in the great hall’ and actually pleases the king; the idea is not ‘The knights looked bravely thither, and the fair down at their laps’.70 Even grace (&lt;em&gt;Grazie&lt;/em&gt;) does not appear in German music without pangs of conscience; only in the presence of native charm (&lt;em&gt;Anmut),&lt;/em&gt; the rustic sister of grace, does the German begin to feel wholly moral – and from that point on increasingly so, all the way up to his rapturous, erudite, often gruff ‘sublimity’, the sublimity of Beethoven. If you want to picture the human being for &lt;em&gt;this&lt;/em&gt; music, well, just imagine Beethoven as he appears beside Goethe – say, at their encounter at Teplitz:71 as semi-barbarism beside culture, as the people beside nobility, as the good-natured human being next to the good and more than merely ‘good’ human being, as the visionary beside the artist, as the man in need of comfort next to the man who is comforted, as the exaggerating and suspicious man next to the fair-minded, as the moody self-tormentor, the foolishly ecstatic, the blissfully unhappy, the guilelessly immoderate, as the presumptuous and crude – and all in all, the ‘untamed human being’:72 that is how Goethe himself experienced and characterized him – Goethe, the exception among Germans for whom no music of equal rank has yet been found! Consider finally whether the ever more widely reaching contempt for melody and the atrophy of the melodic sense among Germans can be understood as a democratic boorishness and after-effect of the Revolution. For melody has such an open joy in lawfulness and such a revulsion towards everything that is inchoate, unformed, and arbitrary that it sounds like a strain from the &lt;em&gt;old&lt;/em&gt; order of things European and like a seduction and return to it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;On the sound of the German language.&lt;/em&gt; – We know where the German comes from that for a few centuries has been accepted as literary German. The Germans, with their reverence for everything that came from &lt;em&gt;the court,&lt;/em&gt; have deliberately taken the chanceries as their model in everything they had to &lt;em&gt;write,&lt;/em&gt; such as letters, documents, wills, and so forth. To write in the style of the chanceries was to write like the courts and the government – that was something distinguished compared to the German spoken in the city in which one happened to live. Eventually one drew the consequences and started to speak the way one wrote – thus one became even more discriminating in word formations, in the choice of words and phrases, and finally also in sound: one affected a courtly tone when speaking, and in the end the affectation became natural. Perhaps nothing like this has happened anywhere else: the triumph of written style over speech and the affectation and pomposity of a whole people as the foundation of a common language that is no longer a mere conjunction of dialects. I believe that the sound of the German language in the middle ages, and especially in the time after the middle ages, was deeply rustic and vulgar; in the last few centuries it has become a bit more refined, primarily because one felt compelled to imitate so many French, Italian, and Spanish sounds – particularly on the part of the German (and Austrian) nobility, which could in no way be content with the mother tongue. But despite this exercise, German must have sounded unbearably vulgar to Montaigne or even Racine; and to this day, in the mouth of travellers even in the midst of an Italian rabble, it sounds very coarse and hoarse, as if it originated in the back woods in smoky cabins and rude regions. I note today that among the former admirers of the chanceries a similar yearning for refinement of sound is spreading, and that the Germans are starting to obey a most peculiar ‘acoustic spell’ which could, in the long run, become a real danger to the German language – for one would seek in vain to find more abhorrent sounds in Europe. Something scornful, cold, indifferent, careless in one’s voice: that is what sounds ‘refined’ to Germans today – and I hear the good will to this refinement in the voices of young officials, teachers, women, merchants; even little girls are starting to imitate this officers’ German. For the officer – specifically the Prussian officer – is the inventor of these sounds: this same officer who as military man and specialist possesses that admirable tact of modesty which all Germans could stand to learn (including German professors and musicians!). But as soon as he speaks and moves, the German officer is the most immodest and distasteful figure in old Europe – quite unselfconsciously, without any doubt! Nor are the good Germans conscious of this when they admire him as the man of the foremost and most distinguished society and gladly let him ‘set the tone’. And so he does! First it is the sergeants and the noncommissioned officers who imitate and coarsen his tone. Just listen to the shouted commands that positively surround German cities with a roar now that they drill outside all the gates: what presumptuousness, what raging sense of authority, what scornful coldness reverberates from this roar! Are the Germans really supposed to be a musical people? It is certain that the Germans are becoming militarized in the sound of their language; it is probable that once they have got used to speaking in a military tone, they will eventually also start writing that way. For being used to certain sounds has a profound effect on character – one soon has the words and phrases, and finally also the thoughts that fit this sound! Maybe the Germans already write like officers; maybe I just read too little of what is written in Germany. But one thing I know more certainly: the public German proclamations that also reach other countries are inspired not by German music but by this new sound of a distasteful presumptuousness. In almost every speech of the foremost German statesman, and even when he lets himself be heard only through his imperial mouthpiece,73 is an accent that repels with revulsion the ear of a foreigner. But the Germans endure it – they endure themselves.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Germans as artists.&lt;/em&gt; – When the German really works up a passion (and not merely the usual good will to passion!), he behaves as he must, and thinks no further about his behaviour. But the truth is that his behaviour is then very clumsy and ugly, as if lacking in tact and melody, so that the spectators merely have their own feelings of embarrassment or pathos and nothing more – &lt;em&gt;unless&lt;/em&gt; he elevates himself into that state of sublimity and rapture, of which many passions are capable. Then even the German becomes &lt;em&gt;beautiful!&lt;/em&gt; An idea of &lt;em&gt;the height at which&lt;/em&gt; beauty first begins to pour its magic even over Germans drives the German artists into the heights and superheights and excesses of passion: in other words, a genuinely deep desire to rise beyond, at least look beyond, the ugliness and clumsiness – to a better, lighter, more southern, sunnier world. And so their cramps are often just indications that they would like to &lt;em&gt;dance:&lt;/em&gt; these poor bears in which hidden nymphs and sylvan gods are at work – and at times still higher deities!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Music as advocate&lt;/em&gt; – ‘I am thirsting for a master composer’, said an innovator to his disciple, ‘who can learn my thoughts from me and hereafter speak them in his language: that way I will better penetrate into people’s ears and hearts. With tones one can seduce people into every error and every truth: who could &lt;em&gt;refute&lt;/em&gt; a tone?’ – ‘So you would like to be considered irrefutable?’ said his disciple. The innovator replied: ‘I wish for the sprout to become a tree. For a teaching to become a tree, it has to be believed for a good while; for it to be believed, it has to be considered irrefutable. The tree needs storms, doubts, worms, and malice in order to reveal the nature and strength of its sprout; may it break if it is not strong enough! But a sprout can only be destroyed – not refuted!’ When he had said that, his disciple cried impetuously: ‘But I believe in your cause and consider it so strong that I will say everything, everything that I still have on my mind against it’. The innovator laughed to himself and wagged a finger at him. ‘This kind of discipleship’, he said, ‘is the best, but it is dangerous and not every kind of teaching can withstand it’.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Our ultimate gratitude to art.&lt;/em&gt; – Had we not approved of the arts and invented this type of cult of the untrue, the insight into general untruth and mendacity that is now given to us by science – the insight into delusion and error as a condition of cognitive and sensate existence – would be utterly unbearable. &lt;em&gt;Honesty&lt;/em&gt; would lead to nausea and suicide. But now our honesty has a counterforce that helps us avoid such consequences: art, as the &lt;em&gt;good&lt;/em&gt; will to appearance. We do not always keep our eyes from rounding off, from finishing off the poem; and then it is no longer eternal imperfection that we carry across the river of becoming – we then feel that we are carrying a &lt;em&gt;goddess,&lt;/em&gt; and are proud and childish in performing this service. As an aesthetic phenomenon existence is still &lt;em&gt;bearable&lt;/em&gt; to us, and art furnishes us with the eye and hand and above all the good conscience to be &lt;em&gt;able&lt;/em&gt; to make such a phenomenon of ourselves. At times we need to have a rest from ourselves by looking at and down at ourselves and, from an artistic distance, laughing &lt;em&gt;at&lt;/em&gt; ourselves or crying &lt;em&gt;at&lt;/em&gt; ourselves; we have to discover the &lt;em&gt;hero&lt;/em&gt; no less than the &lt;em&gt;fool&lt;/em&gt; in our passion for knowledge; we must now and then be pleased about our folly in order to be able to stay pleased about our wisdom! And precisely because we are at bottom grave and serious human beings and more weights than human beings, nothing does us as much good as the &lt;em&gt;fool’s cap:&lt;/em&gt; we need it against ourselves – we need all exuberant, floating, dancing, mocking, childish, and blissful art lest we lose that &lt;em&gt;freedom over things&lt;/em&gt; that our ideal demands of us. It would be a &lt;em&gt;relapse&lt;/em&gt; for us, with our irritable honesty, to get completely caught up in morality and, for the sake of the overly severe demands that we there make on ourselves, to become virtuous monsters and scarecrows. We have also to &lt;em&gt;be able&lt;/em&gt; to stand &lt;em&gt;above&lt;/em&gt; morality – and not just to stand with the anxious stiffness of someone who is afraid of slipping and falling at any moment, but also to float and play above it! How then could we possibly do without art and with the fool? – And as long as you are in any way &lt;em&gt;ashamed&lt;/em&gt; of yourselves, you do not yet belong amongst us!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;New battles.&lt;/em&gt; – After Buddha was dead, they still showed his shadow in a cave for centuries – a tremendous, gruesome shadow. God is dead; but given the way people are, there may still for millennia be caves in which they show his shadow. – And we – we must still defeat his shadow as well!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Let us beware.&lt;/em&gt; – Let us beware of thinking that the world is a living being. Where would it stretch? What would it feed on? How could it grow and procreate? After all, we know roughly what the organic is; are we then supposed to reinterpret what is inexpressibly derivative, late, rare, accidental, which we perceive only on the crust of the earth, as something essential, common, and eternal, as those people do who call the universe an organism? This nauseates me. Let us beware even of believing that the universe is a machine; it is certainly not constructed to one end, and the word ‘machine’ pays it far too high an honour. Let us beware of assuming in general and everywhere anything as elegant as the cyclical movements of our neighbouring stars; even a glance at the Milky Way raises doubts whether there are not much coarser and more contradictory movements there, as well as stars with eternally linear paths, etc. The astral order in which we live is an exception; this order and the considerable duration that is conditioned by it have again made possible the exception of exceptions: the development of the organic. The total character of the world, by contrast, is for all eternity chaos, not in the sense of a lack of necessity but of a lack of order, organization, form, beauty, wisdom, and whatever else our aesthetic anthropomorphisms are called. Judged from the vantage point of our reason, the unsuccessful attempts are by far the rule; the exceptions are not the secret aim, and the whole musical mechanism repeats eternally its tune, which must never be called a melody – and ultimately even the phrase ‘unsuccessful attempt’ is already an anthropomorphism bearing a reproach. But how could we reproach or praise the universe! Let us beware of attributing to it heartlessness or unreason or their opposites: it is neither perfect, nor beautiful, nor noble, nor does it want to become any of these things; in no way does it strive to imitate man! In no way do our aesthetic and moral judgements apply to it! It also has no drive to self-preservation or any other drives; nor does it observe any laws. Let us beware of saying that there are laws in nature. There are only necessities: there is no one who commands, no one who obeys, no one who transgresses. Once you know that there are no purposes, you also know that there is no accident; for only against a world of purposes does the word ‘accident’ have a meaning. Let us beware of saying that death is opposed to life. The living is only a form of what is dead, and a very rare form. Let us beware of thinking that the world eternally creates new things. There are no eternally enduring substances; matter is as much of an error as the god of the Eleatics.1 But when will we be done with our caution and care? When will all these shadows of god no longer darken us? When will we have completely de-deified nature? When may we begin to &lt;em&gt;naturalize&lt;/em&gt; humanity with a pure, newly discovered, newly redeemed nature?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A word now against Kant as a moralist. A virtue must be &lt;em&gt;our&lt;/em&gt; invention; it must spring out of &lt;em&gt;our&lt;/em&gt; personal need and defence. In every other case it is a source of danger. That which does not belong to our life &lt;em&gt;menaces&lt;/em&gt; it; a virtue which has its roots in mere respect for the concept of “virtue,” as Kant would have it, is pernicious. “Virtue,” “duty,” “good for its own sake,” goodness grounded upon impersonality or a notion of universal validity—these are all chimeras, and in them one finds only an expression of the decay, the last collapse of life, the Chinese spirit of Königsberg. Quite the contrary is demanded by the most profound laws of self-preservation and of growth: to wit, that every man find his &lt;em&gt;own&lt;/em&gt; virtue, his &lt;em&gt;own&lt;/em&gt; categorical imperative. A nation goes to pieces when it confounds &lt;em&gt;its&lt;/em&gt; duty with the general concept of duty. Nothing works a more complete and penetrating disaster than every “impersonal” duty, every sacrifice before the Moloch of abstraction.—To think that no one has thought of Kant’s categorical imperative as &lt;em&gt;dangerous to life&lt;/em&gt;!&amp;hellip; The theological instinct alone took it under protection!—An action prompted by the life-instinct proves that it is a &lt;em&gt;right&lt;/em&gt; action by the amount of pleasure that goes with it: and yet that Nihilist, with his bowels of Christian dogmatism, regarded pleasure as an &lt;em&gt;objection&lt;/em&gt;&amp;hellip;. What destroys a man more quickly than to work, think and feel without inner necessity, without any deep personal desire, without pleasure—as a mere automaton of duty? That is the recipe for &lt;em&gt;décadence&lt;/em&gt;, and no less for idiocy&amp;hellip;. Kant became an idiot.—And such a man was the contemporary of Goethe! This calamitous spinner of cobwebs passed for &lt;em&gt;the&lt;/em&gt; German philosopher—still passes today!&amp;hellip; I forbid myself to say what I think of the Germans&amp;hellip;. Didn’t Kant see in the French Revolution the transformation of the state from the inorganic form to the &lt;em&gt;organic&lt;/em&gt;? Didn’t he ask himself if there was a single event that could be explained save on the assumption of a moral faculty in man, so that on the basis of it, “the tendency of mankind toward the good” could be &lt;em&gt;explained&lt;/em&gt;, once and for all time? Kant’s answer: “That is revolution.” Instinct at fault in everything and anything, instinct as a revolt against nature, German &lt;em&gt;décadence&lt;/em&gt; as a philosophy—&lt;em&gt;that is Kant&lt;/em&gt;!—&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Consciousness (Bewußtsein&lt;/em&gt;)6 – Consciousness (&lt;em&gt;Bewußtheit&lt;/em&gt;) is the latest development of the organic, and hence also its most unfinished and unrobust feature. Consciousness gives rise to countless mistakes that lead an animal or human being to perish sooner than necessary, ‘beyond destiny’, as Homer puts it.7 If the preserving alliance of the instincts were not so much more powerful, if it did not serve on the whole as a regulator, humanity would have to perish with open eyes of its misjudging and its fantasizing, of its lack of thoroughness and its incredulity – in short, of its consciousness; or rather, without the instincts, humanity would long have ceased to exist! Before a function is fully developed and mature, it constitutes a danger to the organism; it is a good thing for it to be properly tyrannized in the meantime! Thus, consciousness is properly tyrannized – and not least by one’s pride in it! One thinks it constitutes the &lt;em&gt;kernel&lt;/em&gt; of man, what is abiding, eternal, ultimate, most original in him! One takes consciousness to be a given determinate magnitude! One denies its growth and intermittences! Sees it as ‘the unity of the organism’! This ridiculous overestimation and misapprehension of consciousness has the very useful consequence that an all-too-rapid development of consciousness was &lt;em&gt;prevented.&lt;/em&gt; Since they thought they already possessed it, human beings did not take much trouble to acquire it – and things are no different today! The &lt;em&gt;task&lt;/em&gt; of &lt;em&gt;assimilating knowledge&lt;/em&gt; and making it instinctive is still quite new; it is only beginning to dawn on the human eye and is yet barely discernible – it is a task seen only by those who have understood that so far we have incorporated only our &lt;em&gt;errors&lt;/em&gt; and that all of our consciousness refers to errors!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Now that the affirmative part of my task was done, it was the turn of the denying, the No-saying and &lt;em&gt;No-doing&lt;/em&gt; part: the revaluation of existing values themselves, the great war – the evocation of a day of decision. Included here is the slow search for those related to me, for such as out of strength would offer me their hand for &lt;em&gt;the work of destruction. –&lt;/em&gt; From now on all my writings are fish-hooks: perhaps I understand fishing as well as anyone?… If nothing got &lt;em&gt;caught&lt;/em&gt; I am not to blame. &lt;em&gt;There were no fish&lt;/em&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Origin of knowledge.&lt;/em&gt; – Through immense periods of time, the intellect produced nothing but errors; some of them turned out to be useful and species-preserving; those who hit upon or inherited them fought their fight for themselves and their progeny with greater luck. Such erroneous articles of faith, which were passed on by inheritance further and further, and finally almost became part of the basic endowment of the species, are for example: that there are enduring things; that there are identical things; that there are things, kinds of material, bodies; that a thing is what it appears to be; that our will is free; that what is good for me is also good in and for itself. Only very late did the deniers and doubters of such propositions emerge; only very late did truth emerge as the weakest form of knowledge. It seemed that one was unable to live with it; that our organism was geared for its opposite: all its higher functions, the perceptions of sense and generally every kind of sensation, worked with those basic errors that had been incorporated since time immemorial. Further, even in the realm of knowledge those propositions became the norms according to which one determined ‘true’ and ‘untrue’ – down to the most remote areas of pure logic. Thus the &lt;em&gt;strength&lt;/em&gt; of knowledge lies not in its degree of truth, but in its age, its embeddedness, its character as a condition of life. Where life and knowledge seem to contradict each other, there was never any serious fight to begin with; denial and doubt were simply considered madness. Those exceptional thinkers, like the Eleatics, who still posited and clung to the opposites of the natural errors, believed in the possibility of also &lt;em&gt;living&lt;/em&gt; this opposite: they invented the sage as the man of unchangeability, impersonality, universality of intuition, as one and all at the same time, with a special capacity for that inverted knowledge; they had the faith that their knowledge was at the same time the principle of &lt;em&gt;life.&lt;/em&gt; But in order to be able to claim all this, they had to &lt;em&gt;deceive&lt;/em&gt; themselves about their own state: they had fictitiously to attribute to themselves impersonality and duration without change; they had to misconstrue the nature of the knower, deny the force of impulses in knowledge, and generally conceive reason as a completely free, self-originated activity. They closed their eyes to the fact that they, too, had arrived at their propositions in opposition to what was considered valid or from a desire for tranquillity or sole possession or sovereignty. The subtler development of honesty and scepticism finally made also these people impossible; even their life and judgements proved dependent on the ancient drives and fundamental errors of all sentient existence. This subtler honesty and scepticism arose wherever two conflicting propositions seemed to be &lt;em&gt;applicable&lt;/em&gt; to life because both were compatible with the basic errors, and thus where it was possible to argue about the greater or lesser degree of &lt;em&gt;usefulness&lt;/em&gt; for life; also wherever new propositions showed themselves to be not directly useful, but at least also not harmful, as expressions of an intellectual play impulse, and innocent and happy like all play. Gradually the human brain filled itself with such judgements and convictions; and ferment, struggle, and lust for power developed in this tangle. Not only utility and delight, but also every kind of drive took part in the fight about the ‘truths’; the intellectual fight became an occupation, attraction, profession, duty, dignity – knowledge and the striving for the true finally took their place as a need among the other needs. Henceforth, not only faith and conviction, but also scrutiny, denial, suspicion, and contradiction were a &lt;em&gt;power;&lt;/em&gt; all ‘evil’ instincts were subordinated to knowledge and put in its service and took on the lustre of the permitted, honoured, useful and finally the eye and the innocence of the &lt;em&gt;good.&lt;/em&gt; Thus knowledge became a part of life and, as life, a continually growing power, until finally knowledge and the ancient basic errors struck against each other, both as life, both as power, both in the same person. The thinker – that is now the being in whom the drive to truth and those life-preserving errors are fighting their first battle, after the drive to truth has &lt;em&gt;proven&lt;/em&gt; itself to be a life-preserving power, too. In relation to the significance of this battle, everything else is a matter of indifference: the ultimate question about the condition of life is posed here, and the first attempt is made here to answer the question through experiment. To what extent can truth stand to be incorporated? – that is the question; that is the experiment.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The origin of the logical.&lt;/em&gt; – What is the origin of logic in man’s head? Surely it arose out of the illogical, the realm of which must originally have been immense. But innumerable beings drew inferences in a way different from that in which we do now perished; nonetheless, they might have been closer to the truth! He, for instance, who did not know how to find ‘identity’ often enough, both with regard to nourishment and to hostile animals – that is, he who subsumed too slowly and was too cautious in subsumption – had a slighter probability of survival than he who in all cases of similarity immediately guessed that they were identical. The predominant disposition, however, to treat the similar as identical – an illogical disposition, for there is nothing identical as such – is what first supplied all the foundations for logic. Similarly, in order for the concept of substance to originate, which is indispensable to logic though nothing real corresponds to it in the strictest sense, it was necessary that for a long time changes in things not be seen, not be perceived; the beings who did not see things exactly had a head start over those who saw everything ‘in a flux’. As such, every great degree of caution in inferring, every sceptical disposition, is a great danger to life. No living being would be preserved had not the opposite disposition – to affirm rather than suspend judgement, to err and make things up rather than wait, to agree rather than deny, to pass judgement rather than be just – been bred to become extraordinarily strong. The course of logical thoughts and inferences in our brains today corresponds to a process and battle of drives that taken separately are all very illogical and unjust; we usually experience only the outcome of the battle: that is how quickly and covertly this ancient mechanism runs its course in us.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cause and effect.&lt;/em&gt; – We call it ‘explanation’, but ‘description’ is what distinguishes us from older stages of knowledge and science. We are better at describing – we explain just as little as all our predecessors. We have uncovered a diverse succession where the naive man and investigator of older cultures saw only two different things, ‘cause’ and ‘effect’, as they said; we have perfected the picture of becoming but haven’t got over, got behind the picture. The series of ‘causes’ faces us much more completely in each case; we reason, ‘this and that must precede for that to follow’ – but we haven’t thereby &lt;em&gt;understood&lt;/em&gt; anything. The specifically qualitative aspect for example of every chemical process, still appears to be a ‘miracle’, as does every locomotion; no one has ‘explained’ the push. And how could we explain! We are operating only with things that do not exist – with lines, surfaces, bodies, atoms, divisible times, divisible spaces. How is explanation to be at all possible when we first turn everything into a &lt;em&gt;picture&lt;/em&gt; – our picture! It is enough to view science as an attempt to humanize things as faithfully as possible; we learn to describe ourselves more and more precisely as we describe things and their succession. Cause and effect: there is probably never such a duality; in truth a continuum faces us, from which we isolate a few pieces, just as we always perceive a movement only as isolated points, i.e. do not really see, but infer. The suddenness with which many effects stand out misleads us; it is a suddenness only for us. There is an infinite number of processes that elude us in this second of suddenness. An intellect that saw cause and effect as a continuum, not, as we do, as arbitrary division and dismemberment – that saw the stream of the event – would reject the concept of cause and effect and deny all determinedness.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;On the doctrine of poisons.&lt;/em&gt; – So much has to come together in order for scientific thought to originate, and all these necessary forces have had to be separately invented, practised, cultivated! In their separateness they have, however, very often had a totally different effect from that which they have today when in the realm of scientific thought they mutually limit and keep each other in check: they have worked as poisons, e.g. the doubting drive, the denying drive, the waiting drive, the collecting drive, the dissolving drive. Many hecatombs of human beings had to be sacrificed before these drives learned to grasp their coexistence and feel like functions of one organizing force in one human being! And how far we still are from the time when artistic energies and the practical wisdom of life join with scientific thought so that a higher organic system will develop in relation to which the scholar, the physician, the artist, and the lawmaker, as we now know them, would have to appear as paltry antiquities!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The scope of the moral.&lt;/em&gt; – As soon as we see a new picture, we immediately construct it with the help of all the old experiences we have had &lt;em&gt;depending on the degree&lt;/em&gt; of our honesty and justice. There are no experiences other than moral ones, not even in the realm of sense perception.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The four errors.&lt;/em&gt; – Man has been educated by his errors: first, he saw himself only incompletely; secondly, he endowed himself with fictitious attributes; thirdly, he placed himself in a false rank order in relation to animals and nature; fourthly, he invented ever new tables of goods and for a time took them to be eternal and unconditioned – so that now this, now that human drive and condition occupied first place and was ennobled as a result of this valuation. If one discounts the effect of these four errors, one has also discounted humanity, humaneness, and ‘human dignity’.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Herd instinct.&lt;/em&gt; – Wherever we encounter a morality, we find an evaluation and ranking of human drives and actions. These evaluations and rankings are always the expression of the needs of a community and herd: that which benefits &lt;em&gt;it&lt;/em&gt; the most – and second most, and third most – is also the highest standard of value for all individuals. With morality the individual is instructed to be a function of the herd and to ascribe value to himself only as a function. Since the conditions for preserving one community have been very different from those of another community, there have been very different moralities; and in view of essential changes in herds and communities, states and societies that are yet to come, one can prophesy that there will yet be very divergent moralities. Morality is herd-instinct in the individual.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Herd pangs of conscience.&lt;/em&gt; – During the longest and most remote periods of time there was a kind of pang of conscience completely different from that which exists now. Today one feels responsible only for what one wants and does, and finds one’s pride in oneself: all our teachers of justice start from this feeling of self and pleasure in the individual (des &lt;em&gt;Einzelnen),&lt;/em&gt; as if the spring of justice (&lt;em&gt;des Rechts&lt;/em&gt;)2 had always arisen here. But for the longest period of humanity’s existence there was nothing more frightful than feeling alone (&lt;em&gt;einzeln).&lt;/em&gt; To be alone (&lt;em&gt;allein),&lt;/em&gt; to experience things by oneself (&lt;em&gt;einzeln),&lt;/em&gt; to neither obey nor rule, to represent an individual (&lt;em&gt;ein Individuum bedeuten&lt;/em&gt;) – that was no pleasure back then, but a punishment; one was sentenced ‘to be an individual (&lt;em&gt;Individuum)’.&lt;/em&gt; Freedom of thought was considered discomfort itself. While we experience law and conformity as compulsion and loss, one formerly experienced egoism as a painful thing, as an actual affliction. To be a self, to estimate oneself according to one’s own measure and weight – that was contrary to taste in those days. The inclination to this would have been considered madness, for every misery and every fear were associated with being alone (&lt;em&gt;Alleinsein).&lt;/em&gt; Back then, ‘free will’ had bad conscience as its closest neighbour. The more unfreely one acted, the more the herd instinct and not the sense of self spoke through the action, the more moral one considered oneself. In those days, everything that hurt the herd, whether the individual had willed it or not, gave the individual pangs of conscience – and his neighbour as well; indeed, the whole herd! On this point we have relearned most of all.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Benevolence.&lt;/em&gt; – Is it virtuous when a cell transforms itself into a function of a stronger cell? It has to. And is it evil when the stronger cell assimilates the weaker? It also has to; this is necessary for it, since it strives for superabundant replenishment and wants to regenerate itself. Accordingly one should make a distinction in benevolence between the drive to appropriate and the drive to submit, depending on whether it is the stronger or the weaker who experiences it. Joy and desire go together in the stronger, who wants to transform something into a function of himself; joy and the wish to be desired go together in the weaker, who wants to become a function. Compassion is essentially the former, a pleasant stirring of the drive to appropriate at the sight of the weaker; however, we must still keep in mind that ‘strong’ and ‘weak’ are relative concepts.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;No altruism!&lt;/em&gt; – In many people I see a surplus strength and pleasure in wanting to become a function; they press towards and have the most delicate sense for all places where precisely &lt;em&gt;they&lt;/em&gt; can be a function. Here belong those women who turn themselves into some function of a man that is especially weakly developed in him, and to that extent become his purse or his politics or his sociability. Such beings preserve themselves best when they insert themselves into another organism; if they do not succeed at this, they become cranky, irritated, and devour themselves.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;“I … ,” said Cardiff.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;“Enough,” Culpepper interrupted. “For tonight.”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;He held out another glass of bright amber wine. Cardiff drank. When he looked up, the front screen door of the Egyptian View Arms tapped shut. Someone went upstairs. His ambiance stayed.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Cardiff refilled his glass.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;“Never coming home. Never ever,” he whispered.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;And went up to bed.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Sleep well, someone said somewhere in the house. But he could not sleep. He lay, fully dressed, doing philosophical sums on the ceiling, erasing, adding, erasing again until he sat up abruptly and looked out across the meadow town of thousands of flowers in the midst of which houses rose and sank only to rise again, ships on a summer sea.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I put aside a few sceptics, the types of decency in the history of philosophy: the rest haven’t the slightest conception of intellectual integrity. They behave like women, all these great enthusiasts and prodigies—they regard “beautiful feelings” as arguments, the “heaving breast” as the bellows of divine inspiration, conviction as the &lt;em&gt;criterion&lt;/em&gt; of truth. In the end, with “German” innocence, Kant tried to give a scientific flavour to this form of corruption, this dearth of intellectual conscience, by calling it “practical reason.” He deliberately invented a variety of reasons for use on occasions when it was desirable not to trouble with reason—that is, when morality, when the sublime command “thou shalt,” was heard. When one recalls the fact that, among all peoples, the philosopher is no more than a development from the old type of priest, this inheritance from the priest, this &lt;em&gt;fraud upon self&lt;/em&gt;, ceases to be remarkable. When a man feels that he has a divine mission, say to lift up, to save or to liberate mankind—when a man feels the divine spark in his heart and believes that he is the mouthpiece of supernatural imperatives—when such a mission inflames him, it is only natural that he should stand beyond all merely reasonable standards of judgment. He feels that he is &lt;em&gt;himself&lt;/em&gt; sanctified by this mission, that he is himself a type of a higher order!&amp;hellip; What has a priest to do with philosophy! He stands far above it!—And hitherto the priest has &lt;em&gt;ruled&lt;/em&gt;!—He has determined the meaning of “true” and “not true”!&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;On the aim of science.&lt;/em&gt; – What? The final aim of science should be to give man as much pleasure and as little displeasure as possible? But what if pleasure and displeasure are so intertwined that whoever &lt;em&gt;wants&lt;/em&gt; as much as possible of one &lt;em&gt;must&lt;/em&gt; also have as much as possible of the other – that whoever wants to learn to ‘jubilate up to the heavens’ must also be prepared for ‘grief unto death’?8 And that may well be the way things are! At least the Stoics believed that this is how things are, and they were consistent when they also desired as little pleasure as possible in order to derive as little pain as possible from life (by using the saying ‘The virtuous man is the happiest man’,9 they had both a school slogan for the masses and a fine casuistic delicacy for the refined). Even today you still have the choice: either &lt;em&gt;as little displeasure as possible,&lt;/em&gt; in short, lack of pain – and socialists and politicians of all parties fundamentally have no right to promise their people any more than that – or &lt;em&gt;as much displeasure as possible&lt;/em&gt; as the price for the growth of a bounty of refined pleasures and joys that hitherto have seldom been tasted. Should you decide on the former, i.e. if you want to decrease and diminish people’s susceptibility to pain, you also have to decrease and diminish their &lt;em&gt;capacity for joy.&lt;/em&gt; With &lt;em&gt;science&lt;/em&gt; one can actually promote either of these goals! So far it may still be better known for its power to deprive man of his joys and make him colder, more statue-like, more stoic. But it might yet be found to be the &lt;em&gt;great giver of pain!&lt;/em&gt; – And then its counterforce might at the same time be found: its immense capacity for letting new galaxies of joy flare up!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A Polemic&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;THE three essays of which this Genealogy consists are in regard to expression, intention and art of surprise perhaps the uncanniest things that have ever been written. Dionysos is, as one knows, also the god of darkness. – Each time a beginning which is &lt;em&gt;intended&lt;/em&gt; to mislead, cool, scientific, even ironic, intentionally foreground, intentionally keeping in suspense. Gradually an increasing disquiet; isolated flashes of lightning; very unpleasant truths becoming audible as a dull rumbling in the distance – until at last a &lt;em&gt;tempo feroce&lt;/em&gt; is attained in which everything surges forward with tremendous tension. At the conclusion each time amid perfecdy awful detonations a &lt;em&gt;new&lt;/em&gt; truth visible between thick clouds. – The truth of the &lt;em&gt;first&lt;/em&gt; essay is the psychology of Christianity: the birth of Christianity out of the spirit of &lt;em&gt;ressentiment&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt;, as is no doubt believed, out of the ‘spirit’ – essentially a counter-movement, the great revolt against the domination of &lt;em&gt;noble&lt;/em&gt; values. The &lt;em&gt;second&lt;/em&gt; essay gives the psychology of the &lt;em&gt;conscience&lt;/em&gt;: it is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt;, as is no doubt believed, ‘the voice of God in man’ – it is the instinct of cruelty turned backwards after it can no longer discharge itself outwards. Cruelty here brought to light for the first time as one of the oldest substrata of culture and one that can least be thought away. The &lt;em&gt;third&lt;/em&gt; essay gives the answer to the question where the tremendous &lt;em&gt;power&lt;/em&gt; of the ascetic ideal, the priestly ideal, comes from, although it is the &lt;em&gt;harmful&lt;/em&gt; ideal &lt;em&gt;par excellence&lt;/em&gt;, a will to the end, a &lt;em&gt;décadence&lt;/em&gt; ideal. Answer: &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; because God is active behind the priests, which is no doubt believed, but &lt;em&gt;faute de mieux –&lt;/em&gt; because hitherto it has been the only ideal, because it had no competitors. ‘For man will rather will nothingness than &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; will’… What was lacking above all was a &lt;em&gt;counter-ideal – until the advent of Zarathustra. –&lt;/em&gt; I have been understood. Three decisive preliminary studies of a psychologist for a revaluation of all values. – This book contains the first psychology of the priest.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Health of the soul.&lt;/em&gt; – The popular medical formulation of morality (the originator of which is Ariston of Chios), ‘virtue is the health of the soul’,3 would, in order to be useful, have to be changed at least to read, ‘your virtue is the health of your soul’. For there is no health as such, and all attempts to define such a thing have failed miserably. Deciding what is health even for your &lt;em&gt;body&lt;/em&gt; depends on your goal, your horizon, your powers, your impulses, your mistakes and above all on the ideals and phantasms of your soul. Thus there are innumerable healths of the body; and the more one allows the particular and incomparable to rear its head again, the more one unlearns the dogma of the ‘equality of men’, the more the concept of a normal health, along with those of a normal diet and normal course of an illness, must be abandoned by our medical men. Only then would it be timely to reflect on the health and illness of the &lt;em&gt;soul&lt;/em&gt; and to locate the virtue peculiar to each man in its health – which of course could look in one person like the opposite of health in another. Finally, the great question would still remain whether we can &lt;em&gt;do without&lt;/em&gt; illness, even for the development of our virtue; and whether especially our thirst for knowledge and self-knowledge do not need the sick soul as much as the healthy; in brief, whether the will to health alone is not a prejudice, a cowardice and a piece of most refined barbarism and backwardness.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

But that does not prove them. Life is not an argument; the conditions of life might include error.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Moral scepticism in Christianity.&lt;/em&gt; – Christianity, too, has made a great contribution to enlightenment: it taught moral scepticism in an extremely trenchant and effective way – accusing, embittering, but with untiring patience and refinement; it annihilated in every single man the faith in his ‘virtues’. It caused those great virtuous men, of whom there was no dearth in antiquity, to disappear forever from the face of the earth – those popular men who with a faith in their own perfection went about with the dignity of a toreador. When we now, educated in this Christian school of scepticism, read the moral books of antiquity, e.g. those of Seneca or Epictetus,4 we feel an amusing superiority and are full of secret insights and overviews, as if a child were speaking before an old man or an overenthusiastic young beauty were speaking before La Rochefoucauld:5 we know better what virtue is! In the end, however, we have applied this same scepticism also to all &lt;em&gt;religious&lt;/em&gt; states and procedures, such as sin, repentance, grace, sanctification; and we have all allowed the worm to dig so deeply that even when reading Christian books we now have the same feeling of refined superiority and insight: we also know the religious feelings better! And it is time to know them well and to describe them well, for even the pious of the old faith are dying out: let us save their image and their type at least for knowledge!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Knowledge more than a means.&lt;/em&gt; – Even &lt;em&gt;without&lt;/em&gt; this new passion – I mean the passion for knowledge – science would be promoted: up to now science has grown and matured without it. The good faith in science, the prejudice in its favour that rules our modern states (and formerly even the Church), is essentially based on the fact that this unconditional tendency and urge has manifested itself in science so rarely and that science is specifically regarded &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; as a passion but as a condition and ‘ethos’. Indeed, often mere &lt;em&gt;amour-plaisir&lt;/em&gt;6 of knowledge (curiosity) is sufficient, or &lt;em&gt;amour-vanité,7&lt;/em&gt; being accustomed to it with the ulterior motive of honour and bread; it is even enough for many that they have a surplus of leisure and do not know what to do with it except read, collect, arrange, observe, recount – their ‘scientific drive’ is their boredom. Pope Leo X8 once (in his brief to Beroaldus)9 sang the praise of science: he designated it the most beautiful ornament and the greatest pride of our life, a noble occupation in happiness and unhappiness; ‘without it’, he says finally, ‘all human undertakings would lack a firm hold – indeed, even with it they are changeable and unstable enough!’ But this fairly sceptical pope keeps silent, like all other churchly eulogists of science, his final judgement on science. Although one might infer from his words that he places science above art – strange as this may be for such a friend of the arts – in the end it is nothing but politeness when he does not speak of what he, too, places high above all science: ‘revealed truth’ and the ‘eternal salvation of the soul’. Compared to that, what are ornaments, pride, entertainment, and the security of life to him! ‘Science is something second-class; nothing ultimate, unconditional; not an object of passion’ – this judgement was held back in Leo’s soul: the truly Christian judgement about science! In antiquity the dignity and recognition of science were diminished by the fact that even among her most zealous disciples the striving for &lt;em&gt;virtue&lt;/em&gt; took first place, and that one thought one had given knowledge one’s highest praise when one celebrated it as the best means to virtue. It is something new in history that knowledge wants to be more than a means.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The madman.&lt;/em&gt; – Haven’t you heard of that madman who in the bright morning lit a lantern and ran around the marketplace crying incessantly, ‘I’m looking for God! I’m looking for God!’ Since many of those who did not believe in God were standing around together just then, he caused great laughter. Has he been lost, then? asked one. Did he lose his way like a child? asked another. Or is he hiding? Is he afraid of us? Has he gone to sea? Emigrated? – Thus they shouted and laughed, one interrupting the other. The madman jumped into their midst and pierced them with his eyes. ‘Where is God?’ he cried; ‘I’ll tell you! &lt;em&gt;We have killed him&lt;/em&gt; – you and I! We are all his murderers. But how did we do this? How were we able to drink up the sea? Who gave us the sponge to wipe away the entire horizon? What were we doing when we unchained this earth from its sun? Where is it moving to now? Where are we moving to? Away from all suns? Are we not continually falling? And backwards, sidewards, forwards, in all directions? Is there still an up and a down? Aren’t we straying as though through an infinite nothing? Isn’t empty space breathing at us? Hasn’t it got colder? Isn’t night and more night coming again and again? Don’t lanterns have to be lit in the morning? Do we still hear nothing of the noise of the grave-diggers who are burying God? Do we still smell nothing of the divine decomposition? – Gods, too, decompose! God is dead! God remains dead! And we have killed him! How can we console ourselves, the murderers of all murderers! The holiest and the mightiest thing the world has ever possessed has bled to death under our knives: who will wipe this blood from us? With what water could we clean ourselves? What festivals of atonement, what holy games will we have to invent for ourselves? Is the magnitude of this deed not too great for us? Do we not ourselves have to become gods merely to appear worthy of it? There was never a greater deed – and whoever is born after us will on account of this deed belong to a higher history than all history up to now!’ Here the madman fell silent and looked again at his listeners; they too were silent and looked at him disconcertedly. Finally he threw his lantern on the ground so that it broke into pieces and went out. ‘I come too early’, he then said; ‘my time is not yet. This tremendous event is still on its way, wandering; it has not yet reached the ears of men. Lightning and thunder need time; the light of the stars needs time; deeds need time, even after they are done, in order to be seen and heard. This deed is still more remote to them than the remotest stars – &lt;em&gt;and yet they have done it themselves!&lt;/em&gt;’ It is still recounted how on the same day the madman forced his way into several churches and there started singing his *requiem aeternam deo.*10Led out and called to account, he is said always to have replied nothing but, ‘What then are these churches now if not the tombs and sepulchres of God?’&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Aftereffects of the oldest religiosity.&lt;/em&gt; – Every thoughtless person believes that the will alone is effective; that willing is something simple, absolutely given, underivable, and intelligible in itself. When he does something, e.g. strikes something, he is convinced that it is &lt;em&gt;he&lt;/em&gt; who is striking, and that he did the striking because he &lt;em&gt;wanted&lt;/em&gt; to strike. He does not even notice a problem here; the feeling of &lt;em&gt;will&lt;/em&gt; suffices for him to assume cause and effect, but also to believe that he &lt;em&gt;understands&lt;/em&gt; their relation. He knows nothing of the mechanism of what happened and the hundredfold delicate work that has to be done to bring about the strike, or of the incapacity of the will as such to do even the slightest part of this work. The will is to him a force that works by magic: the belief in the will as the cause of effects is the belief in forces that work by magic. Now, originally man believed, wherever he saw something happen, that a will had to be the cause and that beings with a personal will had to be operating in the background – the concept of mechanics was quite foreign to him. But since man believed for immense periods of time only in persons (and not in substances, forces, things, etc.), the faith in cause and effect has become for him the fundamental faith that he uses everywhere something happens – still today instinctively and as an atavism of the oldest origin. The propositions, ‘no effect without a cause’, ‘every effect again a cause’, appear as generalizations of much narrower propositions: ‘no effecting without willing’; ‘it is possible to have an effect only on willing beings’; ‘no suffering of an effect is ever pure and without consequences, but all suffering is an agitation of the will’ (towards action, defence, revenge, retribution) – but in the prehistory of humanity the former and latter propositions were identical: the former were not generalizations of the latter, but the latter were elucidations of the former.11 With his assumption that only that which wills exists, Schopenhauer enthroned a primordial mythology; he seems never to have attempted an analysis of the will because like everyone else he &lt;em&gt;believed&lt;/em&gt; in the simplicity and immediacy of all willing – whereas willing is actually such a well-practised mechanism that it almost escapes the observing eye. Against him I offer these propositions: first, in order for willing to come about, a representation of pleasure or displeasure is needed. Secondly, that a violent stimulus is experienced as pleasure or pain is a matter of the &lt;em&gt;interpreting&lt;/em&gt; intellect, which, to be sure, generally works without our being conscious of it (&lt;em&gt;uns unbewufit);&lt;/em&gt; and one and the same stimulus &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; be interpreted as pleasure or pain. Thirdly, only in intellectual beings do pleasure, pain, and will exist; the vast majority of organisms has nothing like it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The value of prayer.&lt;/em&gt; – Prayer has been invented for people who never really have thoughts of their own and who know no elevation of the soul or do not notice it if it occurs: what are such people to do in sacred places or in all important situations in life that demand calm and a kind of dignity? In order that they at least do not &lt;em&gt;disturb,&lt;/em&gt; the wisdom of all founders of religions, small as well as great, has prescribed to them the formulas of prayer as a long mechanical work of the lips, combined with exertion of the memory and a same fixed posture of hands and feet and eyes! So they may, like the Tibetans, go ahead regurgitating their ‘om mane padme hum’12 countless times or, as in Benares, count the name of the god off their fingers, Ram-Ram-Ram13 (and so on, with or without charm), or honour Vishnu with his thousand names,14 or Allah with his ninety-nine; or they may use prayer-mills and rosaries – the main point is that this work keeps them still for a time and makes them a tolerable sight: their type of prayer has been invented for the benefit of the pious who know thoughts and elevations of their own. And even they have their tired hours, when a string of venerable words and sounds and a mechanical piety do them good. But supposing these rare human beings – in every religion the religious person is an exception – can figure out what to do; those who are poor in spirit cannot figure out what to do, and to forbid them their prayer-rattling is to deprive them of their religion – as Protestantism increasingly shows us more and more. From such people religion wants only that they &lt;em&gt;keep still&lt;/em&gt; with their eyes, hands, legs, and other organs; thus they are made beautiful for a time and – more like human beings!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Let us not underestimate this fact: that &lt;em&gt;we ourselves&lt;/em&gt;, we free spirits, are already a “transvaluation of all values,” a &lt;em&gt;visualized&lt;/em&gt; declaration of war and victory against all the old concepts of “true” and “not true.” The most valuable intuitions are the last to be attained; the most valuable of all are those which determine &lt;em&gt;methods&lt;/em&gt;. All the methods, all the principles of the scientific spirit of today, were the targets for thousands of years of the most profound contempt; if a man inclined to them he was excluded from the society of “decent” people—he passed as “an enemy of God,” as a scoffer at the truth, as one “possessed.” As a man of science, he belonged to the Chandala[2]&amp;hellip;. We have had the whole pathetic stupidity of mankind against us—their every notion of what the truth &lt;em&gt;ought&lt;/em&gt; to be, of what the service of the truth &lt;em&gt;ought&lt;/em&gt; to be—their every “thou shalt” was launched against us&amp;hellip;. Our objectives, our methods, our quiet, cautious, distrustful manner—all appeared to them as absolutely discreditable and contemptible.—Looking back, one may almost ask one’s self with reason if it was not actually an &lt;em&gt;aesthetic&lt;/em&gt; sense that kept men blind so long: what they demanded of the truth was picturesque effectiveness, and of the learned a strong appeal to their senses. It was our &lt;em&gt;modesty&lt;/em&gt; that stood out longest against their taste&amp;hellip;. How well they guessed that, these turkey-cocks of God!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;On the doctrine of the feeling of power.&lt;/em&gt; – Benefiting and hurting others are ways of exercising one’s power over them – that is all one wants in such cases! We &lt;em&gt;hurt&lt;/em&gt; those to whom we need to make our power perceptible, for pain is a much more sensitive means to that end than pleasure: pain always asks for the cause, while pleasure is inclined to stop with itself and not look back. We &lt;em&gt;benefit&lt;/em&gt; and show benevolence toward those who already depend on us in some way (that is, who are used to thinking of us as their causes); we want to increase their power because we thus increase our own, or we want to show them the advantage of being in our power – that way, they will be more satisfied with their situation and more hostile towards and willing to fight against the enemies of &lt;em&gt;our&lt;/em&gt; power. Whether in benefiting or hurting others we make sacrifices does not affect the ultimate value of our actions; even if we stake our lives, as martyrs do for their church, it is a sacrifice made for &lt;em&gt;our&lt;/em&gt; desire for power or for the preservation of our feeling of power. He who feels ‘I am in possession of the truth’ – how many possessions does he not renounce in order to save this feeling! What would he not throw overboard in order to stay ‘on top’ – that is, &lt;em&gt;above&lt;/em&gt; the others who lack ‘the truth’! The state in which we hurt others is certainly seldom as agreeable, in an unadulterated way, as that in which we benefit others; it is a sign that we are still lacking power, or it betrays a frustration in the face of this poverty; it brings new dangers and uncertainties to the power we do possess and clouds our horizon with the prospect of revenge, scorn, punishment, failure. Only to the most irritable and covetous adherents of the feeling of power – to those for whom the sight of those who are already subjected (the objects of benevolence) is a burden and boredom – might it be more pleasurable to imprint the seal of power on the reluctant. It depends on how one is accustomed to &lt;em&gt;spice&lt;/em&gt; one’s life; it is a matter of taste whether one prefers the slow or the sudden, the safe or the dangerous and daring increase in power – one always seeks this or that spice according to one’s temperament. An easy prey is something contemptible for proud natures; they take delight only at the sight of unbroken persons who could become their enemies and at the sight of all possessions that are hard to come by; they are often hard towards someone who is suffering, for he is not worthy of their contention and pride – but they are the more obliging toward their &lt;em&gt;equals,&lt;/em&gt; against whom it would be honourable to fight and struggle &lt;em&gt;if&lt;/em&gt; the occasion should arise. Spurred by the good feeling of &lt;em&gt;this&lt;/em&gt; perspective, the members of the knightly caste became accustomed to treating each others with exquisite courtesy. Compassion is the most agreeable feeling for those who have little pride and no prospect of great conquests; for them, easy prey – and that is what those who suffer are – is something enchanting. Compassion is praised as the virtue of prostitutes.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

If you want to get a quick idea of how everything was upsidedown before me, make a start with this writing. That which is called &lt;em&gt;idol&lt;/em&gt; on the title-page is quite simply that which has hitherto been called truth. &lt;em&gt;Twilight of the Idols&lt;/em&gt; – in plain terms: the old truth is coming to an end…&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pessimists as victims.&lt;/em&gt; – Wherever a deep dissatisfaction with existence comes to prevail, it is the aftereffects of some great dietary mistake made by a people over a long time that are coming to light. Thus the spread of Buddhism (&lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; its origin) depended greatly on the Indians’ excessive and almost exclusive diet of rice and the general enervation resulting from it. Perhaps the modern European discontent is due to the fact that our prehistory, the entire middle ages, was given to drinking thanks to the influence of Germanic tastes on Europe: the middle ages means the alcohol poisoning of Europe. – The German dissatisfaction with life is essentially a winter sickness exacerbated by the effects of cellar air and the noxious stove fumes in German living rooms.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Origin of sin.&lt;/em&gt; – Sin, as it is now experienced wherever Christianity reigns or once reigned: sin is a Jewish feeling and a Jewish invention; and given that this is the background of all Christian morality, Christianity can be said to have aimed at ‘Judaizing’ the whole world. The extent to which this has succeeded in Europe is best brought out by how alien Greek antiquity – a world without feelings of sin – strikes our sensibility as being, despite all the good will expended by entire generations and many excellent individuals to approach and incorporate this world. ‘Only when you &lt;em&gt;repent&lt;/em&gt; does God have mercy on you’ – to a Greek, that is an object of ridicule and an annoyance; he would say, ‘Maybe slaves feel that way.’ What is here being presupposed is a being who is powerful, supremely powerful and yet enjoys revenge: his power is so great that no harm whatsoever can be done unto him except in matters of honour. Every sin is an injury of respect, a &lt;em&gt;crimen laesae majestatis divinae&lt;/em&gt;16 – and nothing further! Feeling spiritually crushed, degraded, wallowing in the dust – that is the first and last condition of his grace; in sum, restoration of his divine honour! Whether the sin has done any other harm; whether it has planted some deep, growing calamity that seizes and strangles one person after another like a disease; this honour-craving Oriental couldn’t care less: sin is an assault on him, not on humanity! He gives those to whom he grants his grace also this same nonchalance about the natural consequences of sin. God and humanity are here conceived as so separate and opposite that there can basically be no sin against humanity – every deed is supposed to be considered &lt;em&gt;only with respect to its supernatural consequences,&lt;/em&gt; not with respect to its natural consequences; that is what Jewish feeling, to which everything natural is indignity itself, demands. The Greeks, by contrast, were closer to the thought that even sacrilege can have dignity – even theft, as in the case of Prometheus;17 even the slaughter of cattle as the expression of an insane envy, as in the case of Ajax:18 in their need to incorporate into and devise some dignity for sacrilege, they invented &lt;em&gt;tragedy&lt;/em&gt; – an art form and a pleasure that has remained utterly and profoundly foreign to the Jew, despite all his poetic talent and inclination towards the sublime.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The chosen people.&lt;/em&gt; – The Jews, who feel they are the chosen people of all peoples precisely because they are the moral genius of all peoples (owing to their ability &lt;em&gt;more profoundly to despise&lt;/em&gt; the human being in themselves than any other people) – the Jews take a pleasure in their divine monarch and the holy which is similar to that which the French nobility took in Louis XIV. This nobility had surrendered all its power and sovereignty and had become contemptible: in order not to feel this, in order to be able to forget this, there was a need for a royal splendour, a royal authority and plenitude of power &lt;em&gt;without equal&lt;/em&gt; to which only the nobility had access. In rising to the height of the court by virtue of this privilege and seeing from there everything as beneath oneself, as contemptible, one got over an irritable conscience. Thus one deliberately built the tower of royal power ever higher into the clouds and staked on it the ultimate building stones of one’s own power.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Speaking in a parable.&lt;/em&gt; – A Jesus Christ was possible only in a Jewish landscape – I mean one over which the gloomy and sublime thunder clouds of the wrathful Jehovah hovered continually. Here alone was the rare and sudden piercing of a single sunbeam through the gruesome general and perpetual day-night experienced as a miracle of ‘love’, as the ray of the most undeserved ‘grace’. Only here could Christ dream of his rainbow and his heavenly ladder on which God descended to man; everywhere else good weather and sunshine were too much of a rule and everyday occurrence.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Christ’s error.&lt;/em&gt; – The founder of Christianity thought that there was nothing from which men suffered more than their sins. That was his error – the error of one who felt himself free of sin and who lacked experience of it! Thus his soul filled itself with that wonderful fantastic compassion for a torment that was rarely a very great torment even among his people, who invented sin! But the Christians have found a way of retroactively vindicating their master and of sanctifying his error into ‘truth’.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The colour of the passions.&lt;/em&gt; – People like St Paul have an ‘evil eye’ for the passions: they come to know only what is dirty, disfiguring, and heartbreaking about them; hence their ideal impulse seeks the annihilation of the passions, which they see totally purified in the divine. Quite unlike St Paul and the Jews, the Greeks turned their ideal impulse precisely towards the passions and loved, elevated, gilded and deified them; evidently passion made them feel not only happier but also purer and more divine than usual. And the Christians? Did they want to become Jews in this respect? Did they perhaps succeed?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;We have unlearned something. We have become more modest in every way. We no longer derive man from the “spirit,” from the “godhead”; we have dropped him back among the beasts. We regard him as the strongest of the beasts because he is the craftiest; one of the results thereof is his intellectuality. On the other hand, we guard ourselves against a conceit which would assert itself even here: that man is the great second thought in the process of organic evolution. He is, in truth, anything but the crown of creation: beside him stand many other animals, all at similar stages of development&amp;hellip;. And even when we say that we say a bit too much, for man, relatively speaking, is the most botched of all the animals and the sickliest, and he has wandered the most dangerously from his instincts—though for all that, to be sure, he remains the most &lt;em&gt;interesting&lt;/em&gt;!—As regards the lower animals, it was Descartes who first had the really admirable daring to describe them as &lt;em&gt;machina&lt;/em&gt;; the whole of our physiology is directed toward proving the truth of this doctrine. Moreover, it is illogical to set man apart, as Descartes did: what we know of man today is limited precisely by the extent to which we have regarded him, too, as a machine. Formerly we accorded to man, as his inheritance from some higher order of beings, what was called “free will”; now we have taken even this will from him, for the term no longer describes anything that we can understand. The old word “will” now connotes only a sort of result, an individual reaction, that follows inevitably upon a series of partly discordant and partly harmonious stimuli—the will no longer “acts,” or “moves.”&amp;hellip; Formerly it was thought that man’s consciousness, his “spirit,” offered evidence of his high origin, his divinity. That he might be &lt;em&gt;perfected&lt;/em&gt;, he was advised, tortoise-like, to draw his senses in, to have no traffic with earthly things, to shuffle off his mortal coil—then only the important part of him, the “pure spirit,” would remain. Here again we have thought out the thing better: to us consciousness, or “the spirit,” appears as a symptom of a relative imperfection of the organism, as an experiment, a groping, a misunderstanding, as an affliction which uses up nervous force unnecessarily—we deny that anything can be done perfectly so long as it is done consciously. The “pure spirit” is a piece of pure stupidity: take away the nervous system and the senses, the so-called “mortal shell,” and &lt;em&gt;the rest is miscalculation&lt;/em&gt;—that is all!&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The things people call love.&lt;/em&gt; – Greed and love: such different feelings these terms evoke! And yet it could be the same instinct, named twice: once disparaged by those who already &lt;em&gt;have,&lt;/em&gt; in whom the instinct has somewhat calmed down and who now fear for what they ‘have’; the other time seen from the standpoint of the unsatisfied, the thirsty, and therefore glorified as ‘good’. Our love of our neighbours – is it not a craving for new &lt;em&gt;property?&lt;/em&gt; And likewise our love of knowledge, of truth, and altogether any craving for what is new? We slowly grow tired of the old, of what we safely possess, and we stretch out our hands again; even the most beautiful landscape is no longer sure of our love after we have lived in it for three months, and some more distant coast excites our greed: possession usually diminishes the possession. The pleasure we take in ourselves tries to preserve itself by time and again changing something new &lt;em&gt;into ourselves&lt;/em&gt; – that is simply what possession means. To grow tired of a possession is to grow tired of ourselves. (One can also suffer from an excess – even the desire to throw away, to dole out, can take on the honorary name ‘love’.) When we see someone suffering, we like to use this opportunity to take possession of him; that is for example what those who become his benefactors and those who have compassion for him do, and they call the lust for new possessions that is awakened in them ‘love’; and their delight is like that aroused by the prospect of a new conquest. Sexual love, however, is what most clearly reveals itself as a craving for new property: the lover wants unconditional and sole possession of the longed-for person; he wants a power over her soul as unconditional as his power over her body; he wants to be the only beloved, to live and to rule in the other soul as that which is supreme and most desirable. If one considers that this means &lt;em&gt;excluding&lt;/em&gt; the whole world from a precious good, from joy and enjoyment; if one considers that the lover aims at the impoverishment and deprivation of all the competitors and would like to become the dragon guarding his golden hoard as the most inconsiderate and selfish of all ‘conquerors’ and exploiters; if one considers, finally, that to the lover himself the rest of the world appears indifferent, pale, and worthless and that he is prepared to make any sacrifice, upset any order, subordinate any other interest; then one is indeed amazed that this wild greed and injustice of sexual love has been as glorified and deified as it has in all ages – yes, that this love has furnished the concept of love as the opposite of egoism when it may in fact be the most candid expression of egoism. Here is it evidently the have-nots and the yearning ones who have formed linguistic usage – there have probably always been too many of them. Those who were granted much possession and satiety in this area must occasionally have made some casual remark about ‘the raging demon’, as did that most charming and beloved of all Athenians, Sophocles:10 but Eros always laughed at such blasphemers; they were always precisely his greatest darlings. Here and there on earth there is probably a kind of continuation of love in which this greedy desire of two people for each other gives way to a new desire and greed, a &lt;em&gt;shared&lt;/em&gt; higher thirst for an ideal above them. But who knows such love? Who has experienced it? Its true name is &lt;em&gt;friendship.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A Musicians’ Problem&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;1&#34;&gt;1&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;IF one is to be fait to this writing one has to suffer from the destiny of music as from an open wound. – &lt;em&gt;What&lt;/em&gt; is it I suffer from when I suffer from the destiny of music? From this: that music has been deprived of its world-transfiguring, affirmative character, that it is &lt;em&gt;décadence&lt;/em&gt; music and no longer the flute of Dionysos… Supposing, however, that one in this way feels the cause of music to be &lt;em&gt;one’s own&lt;/em&gt; cause, to be the history of &lt;em&gt;one’s own&lt;/em&gt; suffering, one will find this writing full of consideration and mild beyond measure. In such cases to be cheerful and good-naturedly to mock at oneself as well – &lt;em&gt;ridendo dicere&lt;/em&gt; severum where &lt;em&gt;verum dicere&lt;/em&gt; would justify every kind of severity – is humaneness itself. Who really doubts that I, old artillerist that I am, have the ability to bring up my &lt;em&gt;heavy&lt;/em&gt; guns against Wagner? – I kept to myself everything decisive in this matter – I have loved Wagner. – Ultimately this is an attack on a subtle ‘unknown’ who could not easily be detected by another, in the sense and direction of my task – oh, I have still got quite other ‘unknowns’ to reveal than a Cagliostro of music – even more, to be sure, an attack on the German nation growing ever more sluggish and poor in instinct in spiritual matters, ever more &lt;em&gt;honourable&lt;/em&gt;, which with an enviable appetite continues to nourish itself with opposites and knows how to gulp down ‘faith’ as well as scientificality, ‘Christian love’ as well as anti-Semitism, will to power (to the ‘Reich’) as well as the &lt;em&gt;évangile des bumbles;&lt;/em&gt; without having any trouble digesting them… This lack of party in choosing between opposites! This ventral neutrality and ‘selflessness’! This fairness of German &lt;em&gt;taste,&lt;/em&gt; which accords everything equal rights – which finds everything tasty… Without any doubt the Germans are idealists… When I last visited Germany I found German taste occupied in trying to accord Wagner and the Trumpeter of Säckingen equal rights; I myself witnessed how in Leipzig, to the honour of one of the most genuine and German musicians in the old sense of the word German, no mere Reich German, &lt;em&gt;Meister Heinrich Schütz,&lt;/em&gt; they founded a Liszt Society for the encouragement and propagation of &lt;em&gt;cunning&lt;/em&gt; church music… Without any doubt the Germans are idealists…&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Too Jewish.&lt;/em&gt; – If God wanted to become an object of love, he should first of all have had to give up judging and justice: a judge, even a merciful one, is no object of love. The founder of Christianity lacked delicacy of feeling in this regard, being a Jew.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Too oriental.&lt;/em&gt; – What? A god who loves men provided that they believe in him and who casts evil gazes and threats at anyone who does not believe in this love? What? A love hemmed in by conditions as the feeling of an almighty god? A love that has not even mastered the feeling of honour and roused vengefulness? How oriental this all is! ‘If I love you, what does that concern you?’19 is surely a sufficient critique of all of Christianity.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The greatest advantage of polytheism.&lt;/em&gt; – For an individual to posit his &lt;em&gt;own&lt;/em&gt; ideal and to derive from it his own law, joys and rights – that may well have been considered hitherto to be the most outrageous of human aberrations and idolatry itself; indeed, the few who dared it always felt the need to apologize to themselves, usually as follows: ‘Not I! Not I! But a &lt;em&gt;god&lt;/em&gt; through me!’ The wonderful art and power of creating gods – polytheism – was that through which this drive could discharge itself, purify, perfect and ennoble itself; for originally it was a base and undistinguished drive, related to stubbornness, disobedience, and envy. To be &lt;em&gt;hostile&lt;/em&gt; to this drive to have one’s own ideal: that was formerly the law of every morality. There was only one norm: &lt;em&gt;‘the&lt;/em&gt; human being’ – and every people believed itself to &lt;em&gt;have&lt;/em&gt; this one and ultimate norm. But above and outside oneself, in a distant overworld, one got to see a &lt;em&gt;plurality of norms:&lt;/em&gt; one god was not the denial of or anathema to another god! Here for the first time one allowed oneself individuals; here one first honoured the rights of individuals. The invention of gods, heroes, and overmen (&lt;em&gt;Übermenschen&lt;/em&gt;) of all kinds, as well as deviant or inferior forms of humanoid life (&lt;em&gt;Neben- und Untermenschen),&lt;/em&gt; dwarfs, fairies, centaurs, satyrs, demons, and devils, was the invaluable preliminary exercise for the justification of the egoism and sovereignty of the individual: the freedom that one conceded to a god in his relation to other gods one finally gave to oneself in relation to laws, customs, and neighbours. Monotheism, in contrast, this rigid consequence of the teachings of a normal human type – that is, the belief in a normal god next to whom there are only false pseudo-gods – was perhaps the greatest danger to humanity so far: it threatened us with that premature stagnation which, as far as we can tell, most other species have long reached; for all of them believe in one normal type and ideal for their species and have translated the morality of custom (&lt;em&gt;Sittlichkeit der Sitte&lt;/em&gt;) definitively into flesh and blood. In polytheism the free-spiritedness and many-spiritedness of humanity received preliminary form – the power to create for ourselves our own new eyes and ever again new eyes that are ever more our own – so that for humans alone among the animals there are no eternal horizons and perspectives.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Religious wars.&lt;/em&gt; – The greatest progress of the masses up till now has been the religious war, for it proves that the mass has begun to treat concepts with respect. Religious wars start only when the finer quarrels among sects have refined common reason so that even the mob becomes subtle and takes trifles seriously, and actually considers it possible that the ‘eternal salvation of the soul’ might hinge on slight differences between concepts.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Danger for vegetarians.&lt;/em&gt; – A diet consisting primarily of rice leads to the use of opium and narcotics, just as a diet consisting primarily of potatoes leads to the use of liquor. But its subtler effects also include ways of thinking and feeling that work narcotically. This harmonizes with the fact that the promoters of narcotic ways of thinking and feeling, like those Indian gurus, praise precisely a diet that is purely vegetarian and would like to make that a law of the masses: thus they want to call forth and increase a need that &lt;em&gt;they&lt;/em&gt; are able to satisfy.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;German hopes.&lt;/em&gt; – Let us not forget that names of peoples are usually terms of abuse. The Tartars, for example, are literally ‘the dogs’; that is what the Chinese called them. The ‘Germans’: this originally meant ‘heathen’; that is what the Goths after their conversion named the great mass of their unbaptized kindred tribes, in accordance with their translation of the Septuagint20 in which the heathens were designated with a word that in Greek means ‘the nations’; see Ulfilas.21 It would still be possible for the Germans to turn the term of abuse for them into a name of honour by becoming the first &lt;em&gt;un-Christian&lt;/em&gt; nation in Europe: for which Schopenhauer honoured them as having a very strong predisposition. That would be a way of fulfilling the words of &lt;em&gt;Luther,&lt;/em&gt; who taught them to be un-Roman and to say: ‘Here &lt;em&gt;I&lt;/em&gt; stand! &lt;em&gt;I&lt;/em&gt; can do no other!’22&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Where reformations arise.&lt;/em&gt; – At the time of the great corruption of the Church, the Church in Germany was the least corrupt; that is why the Reformation occurred &lt;em&gt;here,&lt;/em&gt; as a sign that even the beginnings of corruption were felt to be intolerable. For relatively speaking, no people has ever been more Christian than the Germans at the time of Luther; their Christian culture was ready to burst into a hundredfold splendour of blossoms – only one more night was needed, but this brought the storm that put an end to everything.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The failure of reformations.&lt;/em&gt; – That several attempts to found new Greek religions have failed testifies to the higher culture of the Greeks even in rather early times; it indicates that even early in Greece, there must have been many diverse individuals whose diverse plights could not be disposed of with a single prescription of faith and hope. Pythagoras23 and Plato, perhaps Empedocles24 as well, and the Orphic enthusiasts25 much earlier yet, were out to found new religions; and the former two had souls and talents which were so much those of founders of religions that one cannot wonder enough at their failure; yet all they managed to found were sects. Every time the reformation of an entire people fails and only sects raise their heads, one may conclude that the people is already very heterogeneous and is starting to break away from crude herd instincts and the morality of custom (&lt;em&gt;Sittlichkeit der Sitte):&lt;/em&gt; a notable hovering condition which one usually disparages as decay in morals and corruption, when in fact it announces the maturation of the egg and the impending breaking of the eggshell. That Luther’s reformation succeeded in the North is a sign of the fact that the North was backward in comparison to the South and still had rather uniform and monochrome needs; Europe would not have been christianized at all had not the culture of the old world of the South gradually been barbarized through an excessive admixture of Germanic barbarian blood and its cultural superiority lost. The more general and unconditional the influence of an individual or an individual’s thought can be, the more homogeneous and the lower must the mass be that is influenced, while counter-movements betray inner counter-needs that also want satisfaction and recognition. Conversely, one may always infer a high level of culture when powerful and domineering natures only manage to have a slight and sectarian influence: this is also true of the individual arts and the areas of knowledge. Where there is ruling, there are masses; where there are masses, there is a need for slavery. Where there is slavery, there are few individuals, and these have herd instincts and conscience against them.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;At midnight the wind blew softly in the window, whispering the curtains, shadowing the moonlight.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There, far across town, lay the cemetery, immense white teeth scattered on a meadow of fresh moon-silvered grass.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Four dozen stones dead, but not dead.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;All lies,&lt;/em&gt; he thought.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;And found himself halfway down the boarding house stairs, surrounded by the exhalations of sleeping people.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Under Christianity neither morality nor religion has any point of contact with actuality. It offers purely imaginary &lt;em&gt;causes&lt;/em&gt; (“God,” “soul,” “ego,” “spirit,” “free will”—or even “unfree”), and purely imaginary &lt;em&gt;effects&lt;/em&gt; (“sin,” “salvation,” “grace,” “punishment,” “forgiveness of sins”). Intercourse between imaginary &lt;em&gt;beings&lt;/em&gt; (“God,” “spirits,” “souls”); an imaginary &lt;em&gt;natural history&lt;/em&gt; (anthropocentric; a total denial of the concept of natural causes); an imaginary &lt;em&gt;psychology&lt;/em&gt; (misunderstandings of self, misinterpretations of agreeable or disagreeable general feelings—for example, of the states of the &lt;em&gt;nervus sympathicus&lt;/em&gt; with the help of the sign-language of religio-ethical balderdash—, “repentance,” “pangs of conscience,” “temptation by the devil,” “the presence of God”); an imaginary &lt;em&gt;teleology&lt;/em&gt; (the “kingdom of God,” “the last judgment,” “eternal life”).—This purely &lt;em&gt;fictitious world&lt;/em&gt;, greatly to its disadvantage, is to be differentiated from the world of dreams; the latter at least reflects reality, whereas the former falsifies it, cheapens it and denies it. Once the concept of “nature” had been opposed to the concept of “God,” the word “natural” necessarily took on the meaning of “abominable”—the whole of that fictitious world has its sources in hatred of the natural (—the real!—), and is no more than evidence of a profound uneasiness in the presence of reality&amp;hellip;. &lt;em&gt;This explains everything.&lt;/em&gt; Who alone has any reason for living his way out of reality? The man who suffers under it. But to suffer from reality one must be a &lt;em&gt;botched&lt;/em&gt; reality&amp;hellip;. The preponderance of pains over pleasures is the cause of this fictitious morality and religion: but such a preponderance also supplies the formula for &lt;em&gt;décadence&lt;/em&gt;&amp;hellip;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;From a distance.&lt;/em&gt; – This mountain makes the entire region it dominates attractive and significant in every way; having said this to ourselves for the hundredth time, we are so unreasonably and thankfully disposed toward it that we suppose that it, the bestower of such delight, must itself be the most delightful thing in the region – and so we climb it and are disappointed. Suddenly the mountain itself and the entire landscape around us, beneath us, seem to have lost their magic; we had forgotten that certain types of greatness, like certain types of goodness, want to be beheld only from a distance and always from below, not from above – only thus do they &lt;em&gt;have an effect.&lt;/em&gt; Perhaps you know people near you who ought to view themselves only from a distance in order to find themselves at all tolerable or attractive and invigorating; self-knowledge is something they should be advised against.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;1&#34;&gt;1&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I KNOW my fate. One day there will be associated with my name the recollection of something frightful – of a crisis like no other before on earth, of the profoundest collision of conscience, of a decision evoked &lt;em&gt;against&lt;/em&gt; everything that until then had been believed in, demanded, sanctified. I am not a man, I am dynamite. – And with all that there is nothing in me of a founder of a religion – religions are affairs of the rabble, I have need of washing my hands after contact with religious people… I do not &lt;em&gt;want&lt;/em&gt; ‘believers’, I think I am too malicious to believe in myself, I never speak to masses… I have a terrible fear I shall one day be pronounced &lt;em&gt;holy:&lt;/em&gt; one will guess why I bring out this book &lt;em&gt;beforehand;&lt;/em&gt; it is intended to prevent people from making mischief with me… I do not want to be a saint, rather even a buffoon… Perhaps I am a buffoon… And none the less, or rather &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; none the less – for there has hitherto been nothing more mendacious than saints – the truth speaks out of me. – But my truth is &lt;em&gt;dreadful:&lt;/em&gt; for hitherto the &lt;em&gt;lie&lt;/em&gt; has been called truth. – R&lt;em&gt;evaluation of all values:&lt;/em&gt; this is my formula for an act of supreme coming-to-oneself on the part of mankind which in me has become flesh and genius. It is my fate to have to be the first &lt;em&gt;decent&lt;/em&gt; human being, to know myself in opposition to the mendaciousness of millennia… I was the first to &lt;em&gt;discover&lt;/em&gt; the truth, in that I was the first to sense – &lt;em&gt;smell&lt;/em&gt; – the lie as lie… My genius is in my nostrils… I contradict as has never been contradicted and am none the less the opposite of a negative spirit. I am a &lt;em&gt;bringer of good tidings&lt;/em&gt; such as there has never been, I know tasks from such a height that any conception of themhas hitherto been lacking; only after me is it possible to hope again. With all that I am necessarily a man of fatality. For when truth steps into battle with the lie of millennia we shall have convulsions, an earthquake spasm, a transposition of valley and mountain such as has never been dreamed of. The concept politics has then become completely absorbed into a war of spirits, all the power-structures of the old society have been blown into the air – they one and all reposed on the lie: there will be wars such as there have never yet been on earth. Only after me will there be &lt;em&gt;grand politics&lt;/em&gt; on earth.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Towards a critique of saints.&lt;/em&gt; – Must one then, in order to have a virtue, want to have it in its most brutal form – the way the Christian saints wanted and needed it, as those who endured life only with the thought that the mere sight of their virtue would destroy the self-esteem of anyone who viewed it? But a virtue with such an effect I call brutal.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;On the origin of religion.&lt;/em&gt; – The metaphysical need is not the origin of religion, as Schopenhauer26 has it, but only a &lt;em&gt;late offshoot&lt;/em&gt; of it. Under the rule of religious ideas, one has got used to the idea of ‘another world (behind, below, above)’ and feels an unpleasant emptiness and deprivation at the annihilation of religious delusions – and from this feeling grows now ‘another world’, but this time only a metaphysical and not a religious one. But what led to the belief in ‘another world’ in primordial times was &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; a drive or need, but an &lt;em&gt;error&lt;/em&gt; in the interpretation of certain natural events, an embarrassing lapse of the intellect.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The greatest change.&lt;/em&gt; – The lighting and colours of everything have changed! We no longer fully understand how the ancients experienced what was most familiar and frequent – for example the day and waking. Because the ancients believed in dreams, waking life had a different light. The same goes for the whole of life, illuminated by a light radiated back on it from death and its significance: our ‘death’ is a completely different death. All experiences shone differently because a god glowed from them; all decisions and prospects concerning the distant future as well, for one had oracles and secret signs and believed in prophecy. ‘Truth’ was formerly experienced differently because the lunatic could be considered its mouthpiece – which makes &lt;em&gt;us&lt;/em&gt; shudder and laugh. Every injustice affected feelings differently, for one feared divine retribution and not just a civil punishment and dishonour. What was joy in an age when one believed in devils and tempters! What was passion when one saw the demons lurking nearby! What was philosophy when doubt was felt as a sin of the most dangerous kind, as a sacrilege against eternal love, as mistrust of everything that is good, lofty, pure, and merciful! We have given things a new colour; we keep on painting them – but what can we nowadays accomplish in comparison to the &lt;em&gt;splendour of colour&lt;/em&gt; of that old master! I mean ancient humanity.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

But thanks to your drunkenness, you don’t break your limbs in the process; your muscles are too slack and your head too dull for you to find the stones of these stairs as hard as the rest of us do! For us, life is a greater danger: we are made of glass – woe unto us if we &lt;em&gt;bump&lt;/em&gt; against something! And everything is lost if we &lt;em&gt;fall&lt;/em&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A criticism of the &lt;em&gt;Christian concept of God&lt;/em&gt; leads inevitably to the same conclusion.—A nation that still believes in itself holds fast to its own god. In him it does honour to the conditions which enable it to survive, to its virtues—it projects its joy in itself, its feeling of power, into a being to whom one may offer thanks. He who is rich will give of his riches; a proud people need a god to whom they can make &lt;em&gt;sacrifices&lt;/em&gt;&amp;hellip;. Religion, within these limits, is a form of gratitude. A man is grateful for his own existence: to that end he needs a god.—Such a god must be able to work both benefits and injuries; he must be able to play either friend or foe—he is wondered at for the good he does as well as for the evil he does. But the castration, against all nature, of such a god, making him a god of goodness alone, would be contrary to human inclination. Mankind has just as much need for an evil god as for a good god; it doesn’t have to thank mere tolerance and humanitarianism for its own existence&amp;hellip;. What would be the value of a god who knew nothing of anger, revenge, envy, scorn, cunning, violence? who had perhaps never experienced the rapturous &lt;em&gt;ardeurs&lt;/em&gt; of victory and of destruction? No one would understand such a god: why should any one want him?—True enough, when a nation is on the downward path, when it feels its belief in its own future, its hope of freedom slipping from it, when it begins to see submission as a first necessity and the virtues of submission as measures of self-preservation, then it &lt;em&gt;must&lt;/em&gt; overhaul its god. He then becomes a hypocrite, timorous and demure; he counsels “peace of soul,” hate-no-more, leniency, “love” of friend and foe. He moralizes endlessly; he creeps into every private virtue; he becomes the god of every man; he becomes a private citizen, a cosmopolitan&amp;hellip;. Formerly he represented a people, the strength of a people, everything aggressive and thirsty for power in the soul of a people; now he is simply &lt;em&gt;the good god&lt;/em&gt;&amp;hellip;. The truth is that there is no other alternative for gods: &lt;em&gt;either&lt;/em&gt; they are the will to power—in which case they are national gods—&lt;em&gt;or&lt;/em&gt; incapacity for power—in which case they have to be good&amp;hellip;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Over the footbridge.&lt;/em&gt; – When dealing with people who are bashful about their feelings, one has to be able to dissimulate; they feel a sudden hatred towards anyone who catches them in a tender or enthusiastic or elevated feeling, as if he had seen their secrets. If one wants to do them good in such moments, one should make them laugh or utter some cold, jocular sarcasm: then their feeling freezes and they regain power over themselves. But I am giving the moral before the story. There was a time in our lives when we were so close that nothing seemed to obstruct our friendship and brotherhood, and only a small footbridge separated us. Just as you were about to step on it, I asked you: ‘Do you want to cross the footbridge to me?’ – But then you didn’t want to any more; and when I asked again, you were silent. Since then, mountains and torrential rivers, and everything which separates and alienates, have been cast between us, and even if we wanted to reach each other, we couldn’t anymore! But when you think of that little footbridge now, you have no words anymore – only sobs and bewilderment.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;About a sick man.&lt;/em&gt; – ‘He is doing badly!’ – ‘What’s wrong?’ – ‘He is suffering from the desire to be praised and finds no nourishment for it.’ ‘Unbelievable! The whole world is celebrating him, and pampering him; he is on everyone’s lips.’ – ‘Yes, but he has a bad ear for praise. If a friend praises him, it sounds to him as if the friend is praising himself. If an enemy praises him, it sounds to him as if the enemy wants be praised for that. And when finally he is praised by any of the rest – and they are not many at all; that is how famous he is! – it offends him that they don’t want him as a friend or enemy; he likes to say: What do I care about people who are capable of trying to play “the just man” even towards me?’&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Open enemies.&lt;/em&gt; – Courage before the enemy is one thing; it does not prevent one from being a coward and indecisive scatterbrain. That is how Napoleon judged ‘the most courageous person’ he knew: Murat.30 Which shows that open enemies are indispensable to some people if they are to rise to &lt;em&gt;their own&lt;/em&gt; kind of virtue, manliness, and cheerfulness.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Elias Culpepper leaned forward to scan Cardiff’s notepad.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;“You got any more doubts, indecisions, or opinions?”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Cardiff mused over his notes. “There don’t seem to be any roaring businesses in Summerton.”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;“A few mice but no buffalo.”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;“No travel agencies, just a train station about to sink in the dust. Main road is mostly potholes. No one seems to leave, and very few arrive. How in Hades do you all survive?”&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Wherever the will to power begins to decline, in whatever form, there is always an accompanying decline physiologically, a &lt;em&gt;décadence&lt;/em&gt;. The divinity of this &lt;em&gt;décadence&lt;/em&gt;, shorn of its masculine virtues and passions, is converted perforce into a god of the physiologically degraded, of the weak. Of course, they do not &lt;em&gt;call&lt;/em&gt; themselves the weak; they call themselves “the good.”&amp;hellip; No hint is needed to indicate the moments in history at which the dualistic fiction of a good and an evil god first became possible. The same instinct which prompts the inferior to reduce their own god to “goodness-in-itself” also prompts them to eliminate all good qualities from the god of their superiors; they make revenge on their masters by making a &lt;em&gt;devil&lt;/em&gt; of the latter’s god.—The &lt;em&gt;good&lt;/em&gt; god, and the devil like him—both are abortions of &lt;em&gt;décadence&lt;/em&gt;.—How can we be so tolerant of the naïveté of Christian theologians as to join in their doctrine that the evolution of the concept of god from “the god of Israel,” the god of a people, to the Christian god, the essence of all goodness, is to be described as &lt;em&gt;progress&lt;/em&gt;?—But even Renan does this. As if Renan had a right to be naïve! The contrary actually stares one in the face. When everything necessary to &lt;em&gt;ascending&lt;/em&gt; life; when all that is strong, courageous, masterful and proud has been eliminated from the concept of a god; when he has sunk step by step to the level of a staff for the weary, a sheet-anchor for the drowning; when he becomes the poor man’s god, the sinner’s god, the invalid’s god &lt;em&gt;par excellence&lt;/em&gt;, and the attribute of “saviour” or “redeemer” remains as the one essential attribute of divinity—just &lt;em&gt;what&lt;/em&gt; is the significance of such a metamorphosis? what does such a &lt;em&gt;reduction&lt;/em&gt; of the godhead imply?—To be sure, the “kingdom of God” has thus grown larger. Formerly he had only his own people, his “chosen” people. But since then he has gone wandering, like his people themselves, into foreign parts; he has given up settling down quietly anywhere; finally he has come to feel at home everywhere, and is the great cosmopolitan—until now he has the “great majority” on his side, and half the earth. But this god of the “great majority,” this democrat among gods, has not become a proud heathen god: on the contrary, he remains a Jew, he remains a god in a corner, a god of all the dark nooks and crevices, of all the noisesome quarters of the world!&amp;hellip; His earthly kingdom, now as always, is a kingdom of the underworld, a &lt;em&gt;souterrain&lt;/em&gt; kingdom, a ghetto kingdom&amp;hellip;. And he himself is so pale, so weak, so &lt;em&gt;décadent&lt;/em&gt;&amp;hellip;. Even the palest of the pale are able to master him—messieurs the metaphysicians, those albinos of the intellect. They spun their webs around him for so long that finally he was hypnotized, and began to spin himself, and became another metaphysician. Thereafter he resumed once more his old business of spinning the world out of his inmost being &lt;em&gt;sub specie Spinozae&lt;/em&gt;; thereafter he became ever thinner and paler—became the “ideal,” became “pure spirit,” became “the absolute,” became “the thing-in-itself.”&amp;hellip; &lt;em&gt;The collapse of a god&lt;/em&gt;: he became a “thing-in-itself.”&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Finding a motive for one’s poverty.&lt;/em&gt; – There is clearly no trick that enables us to turn a poor virtue into a rich and overflowing one, but we can surely reinterpret its poverty nicely into a necessity, so that its sight no longer offends us and we no longer make reproachful faces at fate on its account. That is what the wise gardener does when he places the poor little stream in his garden in the arms of a nymph and thus finds a motive for its poverty: and who wouldn’t need nymphs as he does?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

For he is following it thinking that this will give his laziness full play, and he has not yet discovered that the crowd is not lazy enough for him! That it always pushes ahead! That it allows no one to stand still! – And he so much likes to stand still!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Aside.&lt;/em&gt; – Parliamentarianism, i.e. the public permission to choose between five basic political opinions, flatters and wins the favour of all those who like to &lt;em&gt;appear&lt;/em&gt; independent and individualistic and would like to fight for their opinions. In the end, however, it is irrelevant whether the herd is commanded to have one opinion or permitted to have five. Whoever deviates from the five public opinions and steps aside will always have the whole herd against him.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The Christian concept of a god—the god as the patron of the sick, the god as a spinner of cobwebs, the god as a spirit—is one of the most corrupt concepts that has ever been set up in the world: it probably touches low-water mark in the ebbing evolution of the god-type. God degenerated into the &lt;em&gt;contradiction of life&lt;/em&gt;. Instead of being its transfiguration and eternal Yea! In him war is declared on life, on nature, on the will to live! God becomes the formula for every slander upon the “here and now,” and for every lie about the “beyond”! In him nothingness is deified, and the will to nothingness is made holy!&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ancient pride&lt;/em&gt;. – The specific hue which nobility had in the ancient world is absent in ours because the ancient slave is absent from our sensibility. A Greek of noble descent found such immense intermediate stages and such a distance between his own height and that ultimate baseness that he could barely see the slave clearly any more: not even Plato could really see him. It is different with us, accustomed as we are to the &lt;em&gt;doctrine&lt;/em&gt; of human equality, if not also to equality itself. A creature who is not at its own disposal and who lacks leisure is by no means something despicable to us on that account; perhaps each of us possesses too much of such slavishness in accordance with the conditions of our social order and activity, which are utterly different from those of the ancients. The Greek philosopher went through life feeling secretly that there were far more slaves than one might think – namely, that everyone who was not a philosopher was a slave;11 his pride overflowed when he considered that even the mightiest men on earth might be his slaves. This pride, too, is foreign and impossible for us; not even metaphorically does the word ‘slave’ possess for us its full force.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Work.&lt;/em&gt; – How close work and the worker are now even to the most leisurely among us! The royal courtesy of the words ‘We are all workers!’ would still have been a cynicism and an indecency under the reign of Louis XIV.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Sometime during the night, he sensed that he was once more alone.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;He woke in a panic, at dawn, thinking, &lt;em&gt;I’ve missed the train. It’s come and gone. But, no—&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;He heard the locomotive whistle shrieking across the sky, moaning like a funeral train as the sun rose over desert sands.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Did he or did he not hear a bag, similar to his own, catapult from a not-stopping train to bang the station platform?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The fact that the strong races of northern Europe did not repudiate this Christian god does little credit to their gift for religion—and not much more to their taste. They ought to have been able to make an end of such a moribund and worn-out product of the &lt;em&gt;décadence&lt;/em&gt;. A curse lies upon them because they were not equal to it; they made illness, decrepitude and contradiction a part of their instincts—and since then they have not managed to &lt;em&gt;create&lt;/em&gt; any more gods. Two thousand years have come and gone—and not a single new god! Instead, there still exists, and as if by some intrinsic right,—as if he were the &lt;em&gt;ultimatum&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;maximum&lt;/em&gt; of the power to create gods, of the &lt;em&gt;creator spiritus&lt;/em&gt; in mankind—this pitiful god of Christian monotono-theism! This hybrid image of decay, conjured up out of emptiness, contradiction and vain imagining, in which all the instincts of &lt;em&gt;décadence&lt;/em&gt;, all the cowardices and wearinesses of the soul find their sanction!—&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Evil.&lt;/em&gt; – Examine the lives of the best and the most fruitful people and peoples and ask yourselves whether a tree which is supposed to grow to a proud height could do without bad weather and storms: whether misfortune and exernal resistance, whether any kinds of hatred, jealousy, stubbornness, mistrust, hardness, greed, and violence do not belong to the &lt;em&gt;favourable&lt;/em&gt; conditions without which any great growth even of virtue is scarcely possible? The poison from which the weaker nature perishes strengthens the strong man – and he does not call it poison.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

They feel well in the presence of another person and quickly fall in love with him; consequently they wish him well, and their first judgement is: ‘I like him.’ In such people there is the following succession: the wish to appropriate (they do not scruple much over the worth of the other person), quick appropriation, delight in possession, and action for the benefit of the person possessed.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;But let us leave Mr. Nietzsche: what is it to us that Mr Nietzsche has got well again?&amp;hellip;A psychologist knows few questions as attractive as that concerning the relation between health and philosophy; and should he himself become ill, he will bring all of his scientific curiosity into the illness. For assuming that one is a person, one necessarily also has the philosophy of that person; but here there is a considerable difference. In some, it is their weaknesses that philosophize; in others, their riches and strengths. The former &lt;em&gt;need&lt;/em&gt; their philosophy, be it as a prop, a sedative, medicine, redemption, elevation, or self-alienation; for the latter, it is only a beautiful luxury, in the best case the voluptuousness of a triumphant gratitude that eventually has to inscribe itself in cosmic capital letters on the heaven of concepts. In the former, more common case, however, when it is distress that philosophizes, as in all sick thinkers – and perhaps sick thinkers are in the majority in the history of philosophy – what will become of the thought that is itself subjected to the &lt;em&gt;pressure&lt;/em&gt; of illness? This is the question that concerns the psychologist, and here an experiment is possible. Just like a traveller who resolves to wake up at a certain hour and then calmly gives himself up to sleep, so too we philosophers, should we become ill, temporarily surrender with body and soul to the illness – we shut our eyes to ourselves, as it were. And as the traveller knows that something is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; asleep, something that will count the hours and wake him up, we, too, know that the decisive moment will find us awake, that something will then leap forward and catch the mind &lt;em&gt;in the act,&lt;/em&gt; i.e. in its weakness or repentance or hardening or gloom, and whatever else the pathological states of the mind are called that on healthy days are opposed by the &lt;em&gt;pride&lt;/em&gt; of the mind (for the old saying still holds: ‘the proud mind, the peacock, and the horse are the three proudest animals on earth’). After such self-questioning, self-temptation, one acquires a subtler eye for all philosophizing to date; one is better than before at guessing the involuntary detours, alleyways, resting places, and &lt;em&gt;sunning&lt;/em&gt; places of thought to which suffering thinkers are led and misled on account of their suffering; one now knows where the sick &lt;em&gt;body&lt;/em&gt; and its needs unconsciously urge, push, and lure the mind – towards sun, stillness, mildness, patience, medicine, balm in some sense. Every philosophy that ranks peace above war, every ethic with a negative definition of happiness, every metaphysics and physics that knows some &lt;em&gt;finale,&lt;/em&gt; a final state of some sort, every predominantly aesthetic or religious craving for some Apart, Beyond, Outside, Above, permits the question whether it was not illness that inspired the philosopher. The unconscious disguise of physiological needs under the cloaks of the objective, ideal, purely spiritual goes frighteningly far – and I have asked myself often enough whether, on a grand scale, philosophy has been no more than an interpretation of the body and a &lt;em&gt;misunderstanding of the body.&lt;/em&gt; Behind the highest value judgements that have hitherto guided the history of thought are concealed misunderstandings of the physical constitution – of individuals or classes or even whole races. All those bold lunacies of metaphysics, especially answers to the question about the &lt;em&gt;value&lt;/em&gt; of existence, may always be considered first of all as symptoms of certain &lt;em&gt;bodies;&lt;/em&gt; and if such world affirmations or world negations lack altogether any grain of significance when measured scientifically, they give the historian and psychologist all the more valuable hints as symptoms of the body, of its success or failure, its fullness, power and highhandedness in history, or of its frustrations, fatigues, impoverishments, its premonitions of the end, its will to an end. I am still waiting for a philosophical &lt;em&gt;physician&lt;/em&gt; in the exceptional sense of the term – someone who has set himself the task of pursuing the problem of the total health of a people, time, race or of humanity – to summon the courage at last to push my suspicion to its limit and risk the proposition: what was at stake in all philosophizing hitherto was not at all ‘truth’ but rather something else – let us say health, future, growth, power, life&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Chapter Two&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When we met again, the tantra master was much more forthcoming. I was greeted with a warm embrace and invited to relax under the banyan tree. I sensed that I now belonged. In an awed voice I asked him, “What was it that I saw?”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;He chuckled at my neophyte’s excitement. “So, you were impressed?” I nodded. “You saw Mohini, a demoness from the underworld. Had you known how, you could have entered a pact with her for the next cycle of Jupiter (twelve years). You promise to satisfy her lust once a month, and she will do your bidding in return – protect your property, destroy your enemies, whatever.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In my first Lecture I endeavored to remove the prejudice that everything in India is strange, and so different from the intellectual life which we are accustomed to in England, that the twenty or twenty-five years which a civil servant has to spend in the East seem often to him a kind of exile that he must bear as well as he can, but that severs him completely from all those higher pursuits by which life is made enjoyable at home. This need not be so and ought not to be so, if only it is clearly seen how almost every one of the higher interests that make life worth living here in England, may find as ample scope in India as in England.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In my condemnation of Christianity I surely hope I do no injustice to a related religion with an even larger number of believers: I allude to &lt;em&gt;Buddhism&lt;/em&gt;. Both are to be reckoned among the nihilistic religions—they are both &lt;em&gt;décadence&lt;/em&gt; religions—but they are separated from each other in a very remarkable way. For the fact that he is able to &lt;em&gt;compare&lt;/em&gt; them at all the critic of Christianity is indebted to the scholars of India.—Buddhism is a hundred times as realistic as Christianity—it is part of its living heritage that it is able to face problems objectively and coolly; it is the product of long centuries of philosophical speculation. The concept, “god,” was already disposed of before it appeared. Buddhism is the only genuinely &lt;em&gt;positive&lt;/em&gt; religion to be encountered in history, and this applies even to its epistemology (which is a strict phenomenalism). It does not speak of a “struggle with sin,” but, yielding to reality, of the “struggle with suffering.” Sharply differentiating itself from Christianity, it puts the self-deception that lies in moral concepts behind it; it is, in my phrase, &lt;em&gt;beyond&lt;/em&gt; good and evil.—The two physiological facts upon which it grounds itself and upon which it bestows its chief attention are: first, an excessive sensitiveness to sensation, which manifests itself as a refined susceptibility to pain, and &lt;em&gt;secondly&lt;/em&gt;, an extraordinary spirituality, a too protracted concern with concepts and logical procedures, under the influence of which the instinct of personality has yielded to a notion of the “impersonal.” (—Both of these states will be familiar to a few of my readers, the objectivists, by experience, as they are to me). These physiological states produced a &lt;em&gt;depression&lt;/em&gt;, and Buddha tried to combat it by hygienic measures. Against it he prescribed a life in the open, a life of travel; moderation in eating and a careful selection of foods; caution in the use of intoxicants; the same caution in arousing any of the passions that foster a bilious habit and heat the blood; finally, no &lt;em&gt;worry&lt;/em&gt;, either on one’s own account or on account of others. He encourages ideas that make for either quiet contentment or good cheer—he finds means to combat ideas of other sorts. He understands good, the state of goodness, as something which promotes health. &lt;em&gt;Prayer&lt;/em&gt; is not included, and neither is &lt;em&gt;asceticism&lt;/em&gt;. There is no categorical imperative nor any disciplines, even within the walls of a monastery (—it is always possible to leave—). These things would have been simply means of increasing the excessive sensitiveness above mentioned. For the same reason he does not advocate any conflict with unbelievers; his teaching is antagonistic to nothing so much as to revenge, aversion, &lt;em&gt;ressentiment&lt;/em&gt; (—“enmity never brings an end to enmity”: the moving refrain of all Buddhism&amp;hellip;.) And in all this he was right, for it is precisely these passions which, in view of his main regiminal purpose, are &lt;em&gt;unhealthful&lt;/em&gt;. The mental fatigue that he observes, already plainly displayed in too much “objectivity” (that is, in the individual’s loss of interest in himself, in loss of balance and of “egoism”), he combats by strong efforts to lead even the spiritual interests back to the &lt;em&gt;ego&lt;/em&gt;. In Buddha’s teaching egoism is a duty. The “one thing needful,” the question “how can you be delivered from suffering,” regulates and determines the whole spiritual diet. (—Perhaps one will here recall that Athenian who also declared war upon pure “scientificality,” to wit, Socrates, who also elevated egoism to the estate of a morality).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The dignity of foolishness.&lt;/em&gt; – A few millennia further along the course set by the last century – and everything men do will display the highest prudence: but just that way prudence will lose all its dignity. Then it will, to be sure, be necessary to be prudent, but it will also be so commonplace and vulgar that even a moderately aristocratic taste will experience this necessity as a &lt;em&gt;vulgarity.&lt;/em&gt; And just as a tyranny of truth and science could increase esteem for the lie, a tyranny of prudence could spur a new kind of nobility. To be noble might then come to mean: to entertain follies.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A rare random white pill.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;At this point, Hindu resurgence is approaching a point of inflection. There was one such turning point some years back, which significantly shifted the Overton window away from the inane secularist gibberish that followed from the state sponsored indoctrination also called Indian schooling. The indoctrination went on unchecked in the pre-internet era. With the coming of the internet, it took just a decade for truth to prevail on the emotional plane and a large number of people outgrew their conditioning and fear to start speaking freely about things that had oppressed them.+++(5)+++ Those who couldn&amp;rsquo;t keep up with the change became irrelevant. People lost friends, there were fights among family members and neighbours over history, politics and religion. This was a moment of clarity.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The recent spate of Hindu k!11!ngs in Kashmir is not surprising, at least to those who place the truth above loyalty to strangers in power. For everyone else it is yet another ineffective reality check that does not even generate online outrage any longer. But why are H so obstinately immune to reality? Here are five systemic reasons, in no particular order but all organically linked and reinforcing each other to form a vicious cycle.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The things necessary to Buddhism are a very mild climate, customs of great gentleness and liberality, and &lt;em&gt;no&lt;/em&gt; militarism; moreover, it must get its start among the higher and better educated classes. Cheerfulness, quiet and the absence of desire are the chief desiderata, and they are &lt;em&gt;attained&lt;/em&gt;. Buddhism is not a religion in which perfection is merely an object of aspiration: perfection is actually normal.—&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Under Christianity the instincts of the subjugated and the oppressed come to the fore: it is only those who are at the bottom who seek their salvation in it. Here the prevailing pastime, the favourite remedy for boredom is the discussion of sin, self-criticism, the inquisition of conscience; here the emotion produced by &lt;em&gt;power&lt;/em&gt; (called “God”) is pumped up (by prayer); here the highest good is regarded as unattainable, as a gift, as “grace.” Here, too, open dealing is lacking; concealment and the darkened room are Christian. Here body is despised and hygiene is denounced as sensual; the church even ranges itself against cleanliness (—the first Christian order after the banishment of the Moors closed the public baths, of which there were 270 in Cordova alone). Christian, too, is a certain cruelty toward one’s self and toward others; hatred of unbelievers; the will to persecute. Sombre and disquieting ideas are in the foreground; the most esteemed states of mind, bearing the most respectable names, are epileptoid; the diet is so regulated as to engender morbid symptoms and over-stimulate the nerves. Christian, again, is all deadly enmity to the rulers of the earth, to the “aristocratic”—along with a sort of secret rivalry with them (—one resigns one’s “body” to them; one wants &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; one’s “soul”&amp;hellip;). And Christian is all hatred of the intellect, of pride, of courage, of freedom, of intellectual &lt;em&gt;libertinage&lt;/em&gt;; Christian is all hatred of the senses, of joy in the senses, of joy in general&amp;hellip;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;To the teachers of selflessness.&lt;/em&gt; – A person’s virtues are called &lt;em&gt;good&lt;/em&gt; with respect to their presumed effects not on him but on us and society – the praise of virtues has always been far from ‘selfless’, far from ‘unegoistic’! For otherwise one would have had to recognize that the virtues (such as diligence, obedience, chastity, piety, justice) are mostly &lt;em&gt;harmful&lt;/em&gt; to their possessors, being drives which dominate them all too violently and covetously and in no way let reason keep them in balance with the other drives. When you have a virtue – a real, complete virtue (and not just a small drive towards some virtue) – you are its &lt;em&gt;victim!&lt;/em&gt; But the neighbour praises your virtue precisely on that account! One praises the diligent even if he should harm his vision or the originality and freshness of his spirit; one honours and feels sorry for the youth who has ‘worked himself to death’ because one thinks: ‘For society as a whole the loss of even the best individual is merely a small sacrifice! Too bad that the sacrifice is necessary! It would surely be much worse though if the individual had thought otherwise and considered his own preservation and development more important than his work in the service of society!’ And so one feels sorry for this youth, not for his own sake but because a devoted &lt;em&gt;tool,&lt;/em&gt; ruthless towards itself – a so-called ‘good man’ – has been lost to society through his death. Perhaps one also asks whether it would not have been more useful to society if he had worked in a way that was less negligent towards himself and had preserved himself longer – yes, one admits that there would have been some advantage in that, but considers this other advantage to be greater and more last; that a &lt;em&gt;sacrifice&lt;/em&gt; was made and the ethos of the sacrificial animal once again vindicated &lt;em&gt;for all to see.&lt;/em&gt; What is, therefore, first really praised when virtues are praised is their instrumental nature and then the blind drive in every virtue that refuses to be held in check by the overall advantage of the individual – in short, the unreason in virtue that leads the individual to allow himself to be transformed into a mere function of the whole. The praise of virtues is the praise of something privately harmful – the praise of drives which deprive a human being of his noblest selfishness and of the strength for the highest form of self-protection. For the sake of inculcating and incorporating virtuous habits into people, to be sure, one emphasizes various effects of virtue that make virtue and private advantage appear as sisters – and there is in fact such a relationship! Blindly raging industriousness, for example – this typical virtue of an instrument – is represented as the road to riches and honour and as the best poison for curing boredom and the passions; but one keeps silent about its danger, its extreme dangerousness. That is how education always proceeds: it tries to condition the individual through various attractions and advantages to adopt a way of thinking and behaving that, when it has become habit, drive and passion, will rule in him and over him &lt;em&gt;against his ultimate advantage&lt;/em&gt; but ‘for the common good’. How often I see it: that blindly raging industriousness brings riches and honour but at the same time deprives the organs of refinement that make it possible to enjoy the riches and honour; also, that this chief antidote to boredom and to the passions at the same time dulls the senses and makes the spirit resistant to new attractions. (The most industrious age – our own – doesn’t know how to make anything of all its industriousness and money except still more money and still more industriousness; for more genius is required to spend than to acquire! – Well, we’ll still have our ‘grandchildren’!) If education is successful, each virtue of the individual is a public utility and a private disadvantage with respect to the highest private end – probably involving some deterioration of the spirit and the senses or even a premature demise: consider from this standpoint the virtues of obedience, chastity, piety, and justice. The praise of the selfless, the self-sacrificing, the virtuous – that is, of the person who does not apply his entire strength and reason to &lt;em&gt;his own&lt;/em&gt; preservation, development, elevation, promotion, and expansion of power, but rather lives, as regards himself, modestly and throughtlessly, maybe even with indifference and irony – this praise is certainly not born out of the spirit of selflessness! The ‘neighbour’ praises selflessness because &lt;em&gt;it brings him advantages!&lt;/em&gt; If the neighbour himself thought ‘selflessly’, he would reject this decrease in strength, this harm for &lt;em&gt;his&lt;/em&gt; benefit; he would work against the development of such inclinations, and above all he would affirm his selflessness by &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; calling it &lt;em&gt;good!&lt;/em&gt; Hereby we hint at the fundamental contradiction in the morality that is very much honoured just now: the &lt;em&gt;motives&lt;/em&gt; to this morality stand in opposition to its &lt;em&gt;principle!&lt;/em&gt; What this morality wants to use as its proof, it refutes with its criterion of what is moral! In order not to contradict itself, the command ‘You shall renounce yourself and sacrifice yourself’ could be proclaimed only by a being which thereby renounced its own advantage and perhaps, through the demanded sacrifice of the individual, brought about its own destruction. But as soon as the neighbour (or society) recommends altruism &lt;em&gt;for the sake of its utility,&lt;/em&gt; it is using the directly opposed principle, ‘You shall seek your advantage even at the expense of everything else’ – and thus one preaches, in the same breath, a ‘Thou shalt’ and a ‘Thou shalt not’!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Cardiff led McCoy into the vast yard of motionless stones and flightless angels. McCoy peered at the markers.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;“Damn. There’s plenty of names, but no dates. When did they die?”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;“They didn’t,” Cardiff said softly.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;“Good God, lemme look closer.”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;McCoy took six steps west, four steps east, and came to …&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The open grave with a coffin gaping wide, and a spade tossed to one side.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;“What’s this? Funeral today?”&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;When Christianity departed from its native soil, that of the lowest orders, the &lt;em&gt;underworld&lt;/em&gt; of the ancient world, and began seeking power among barbarian peoples, it no longer had to deal with &lt;em&gt;exhausted&lt;/em&gt; men, but with men still inwardly savage and capable of self-torture—in brief, strong men, but bungled men. Here, unlike in the case of the Buddhists, the cause of discontent with self, suffering through self, is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; merely a general sensitiveness and susceptibility to pain, but, on the contrary, an inordinate thirst for inflicting pain on others, a tendency to obtain subjective satisfaction in hostile deeds and ideas. Christianity had to embrace &lt;em&gt;barbaric&lt;/em&gt; concepts and valuations in order to obtain mastery over barbarians: of such sort, for example, are the sacrifices of the first-born, the drinking of blood as a sacrament, the disdain of the intellect and of culture; torture in all its forms, whether bodily or not; the whole pomp of the cult. Buddhism is a religion for peoples in a further state of development, for races that have become kind, gentle and over-spiritualized (—Europe is not yet ripe for it—): it is a summons that takes them back to peace and cheerfulness, to a careful rationing of the spirit, to a certain hardening of the body. Christianity aims at mastering &lt;em&gt;beasts of prey&lt;/em&gt;; its modus operandi is to make them &lt;em&gt;ill&lt;/em&gt;—to make feeble is the Christian recipe for taming, for “&lt;em&gt;civilizing&lt;/em&gt;.” Buddhism is a religion for the closing, over-wearied stages of civilization. Christianity appears before civilization has so much as begun—under certain circumstances it lays the very foundations thereof.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;*L’ordre du jour pour le roi.*12 – The day begins: let us begin to organize for this day the business and festivities of our most gracious master who is still deigning to repose. His majesty has bad weather today: we shall be careful not to call it bad; we shall not speak of the weather – but we shall be a bit more ceremonious about the business than would otherwise be necessary and a bit more festive about the festivities. His majesty may even be ill: at breakfast we shall present the latest good news of last evening, the arrival of Mr Montaigne, who jokes so agreeably about his illness; he’s suffering from a stone.13 We shall receive a few persons (persons! What that puffed-up old frog who will be among them would say if he heard this word! ‘I am not a person’, he would say, ‘but always the matter itself’14) – and this reception will take longer than anyone finds agreeable: that is reason enough to tell about the poet who wrote on his door, ‘Whoever enters here will pay me an honour; whoever does not – a pleasure.’15 Truly a polite way to express a rudeness! And perhaps this poet is for his part quite right in being rude: they say his poems are better than their maker. Well, then let him write many more and withdraw himself from the world as much as possible – that is after all the meaning of his civil incivility! Conversely, a prince is always worth more than his ‘verse’, even if – but what are we doing? We are gossiping and the whole court thinks we are already working and racking our brains – one sees no light earlier than the one burning in our window. Listen! Wasn’t that the bell? Damn! The day and the dance are beginning and we don’t know the programme! So we have to improvise – the whole world improvises its day. Let’s just do today as the whole world does! And there my strange morning dream vanished, probably the victim of the hard strokes of the tower bell, which just announced the fifth hour with all of its customary importance. It seems to me that this time the god of dreams wanted to poke fun at my habit of starting the day by organizing it and making it tolerable &lt;em&gt;to myself,&lt;/em&gt; and it may well be that I have often done this in too formal and princelike a manner.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Buddhism, I repeat, is a hundred times more austere, more honest, more objective. It no longer has to &lt;em&gt;justify&lt;/em&gt; its pains, its susceptibility to suffering, by interpreting these things in terms of sin—it simply says, as it simply thinks, “I suffer.” To the barbarian, however, suffering in itself is scarcely understandable: what he needs, first of all, is an explanation as to &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; he suffers. (His mere instinct prompts him to deny his suffering altogether, or to endure it in silence.) Here the word “devil” was a blessing: man had to have an omnipotent and terrible enemy—there was no need to be ashamed of suffering at the hands of such an enemy.—&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The signs of corruption.&lt;/em&gt; – Consider the following signs of those states of society that are necessary from time to time and that are designated by the word ‘corruption’. As soon as corruption sets in anywhere, a colourful &lt;em&gt;superstition&lt;/em&gt; takes over, and the previous common faith of a people becomes pale and powerless against it: for supersitition is free-spiritedness of the second rank – whoever succumbs to it selects certain forms and formulas that appeal to him and allows himself some freedom of choice. The superstitious person is always, compared to the religious person, much more of a ‘person’, and a superstitious society will be one in which there are many individuals and much delight in individuality. From this perspective, superstition always appears as &lt;em&gt;progress&lt;/em&gt; against faith and as a sign that the intellect is becoming more independent and demanding its rights. Those who then complain about corruption are the devotees of the old religion and religiosity – until now they have also determined linguistic usage and given superstition a bad name even among the freest spirits. Let us realize that it is actually a symptom of &lt;em&gt;enlightenment.&lt;/em&gt; Secondly, a society in which corruption spreads is accused of laxity; and it is obvious that the esteem of war and the pleasure in war diminish, while the comforts of life are now desired just as ardently as were warlike and athletic honours formerly. What is usually overlooked, however, is that the ancient civil energy and passion, which received a magnificent visibility through war and competitive games, has now transformed itself into countless private passions and has merely become less visible; indeed, in times of ‘corruption’ the power and force of a people’s expended energies are probably greater than ever, and the individual spends them on a lavish scale which he could not previously have afforded – when he was not yet rich enough! And thus it is precisely in times of ‘laxness’ that tragedy runs through the houses and streets, that great love and great hatred are born and the flame of knowledge blazes up into the sky. Thirdly, it is usually said to the credit of such societies, as if one wanted to compensate for the reproaches of superstition and laxness, that they are milder and that cruelty declines drastically in comparison to the older, stronger, more devout age. But this praise I cannot endorse any more than the reproaches: I concede only that cruelty now &lt;em&gt;refines&lt;/em&gt; itself and that its older forms henceforth offend taste; but wounding and torturing with word and eye reaches its highest cultivation in times of corruption – it is now alone that &lt;em&gt;malice&lt;/em&gt; and the delight in malice are born. People who live in an age of corruption are witty and slanderous; they know that there are other kinds of murder than by dagger or assault; they also know that whatever is &lt;em&gt;well said&lt;/em&gt; is believed. Fourthly, when ‘morals decay’, those beings emerge for the first time who are called tyrants: they are the precursors and as it were the precocious &lt;em&gt;firstling instances of individuals.&lt;/em&gt; Just a little bit longer and this fruit of fruits hangs ripe and yellow on the tree of a people – and this tree existed only for the sake of this fruit! Once decay has reached its peak along with the struggle of all sorts of tyrants, the Caesar always appears, the final tyrant who puts an end to the weary wrestling for sole rule by putting weariness to work for himself. In his age the individual is usually ripest and culture is therefore at its highest and most fruitful stage, but not for the sake of him and not through him, though those of the highest culture like to flatter their Caesar by claiming to be &lt;em&gt;his&lt;/em&gt; work. In truth they need peace from without because they have enough unrest and work within. In these times, bribery and treason are at their peak, for the love of the newly discovered ego is now much mightier than the love of the old, used-up, touted-to-death ‘fatherland’, and the need to secure oneself from the terrible ups and downs of luck opens even noble hands as soon as someone who is mighty and wealthy shows himself willing to pour gold into them. There is now so very little secure future; one lives for today: a state of soul that makes an easy game for all seducers, for one allows oneself to be seduced and bribed only ‘for today’ and reserves the future and virtue for oneself! As is well known the individuals, these true ‘in-and-for-themselves’, care more about the moment than do their opposites, the herd people, for they consider themselves just as unpredictable as the future. They also like to join up with people of violence because they think themselves capable of actions and information which the common people would neither understand nor forgive, while the tyrant or Caesar would understand the rights of the individual even in his excesses and has an interest in advocating and even abetting a bolder private morality. For he thinks of himself and wants his self to be thought of as Napoleon once expressed it in his classic manner : ‘I have the right to answer all charges against me with an eternal “That is me.” I am apart from all the world and accept conditions from no one. I want people to submit even to my fantasies and to find it natural when I yield to this or that distraction.’ That is what Napoleon once replied to his wife when she had reasons to question her husband’s marital fidelity.16Times of corruption are those in which the apples fall from the tree: I mean the individuals, the seed-bearers of the future, the spiritual colonizers and shapers of new states and communities. Corruption is just a rude word for the &lt;em&gt;autumn&lt;/em&gt; of a people.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;In order to move the crowd.&lt;/em&gt; – Must not he who wants to move the crowd be an actor playing the role of himself? Must he not first translate himself into the grotesquely obvious and &lt;em&gt;present&lt;/em&gt; his entire person and cause in this coarsened and simplified version?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Here I barely touch upon the problem of the &lt;em&gt;origin&lt;/em&gt; of Christianity. The &lt;em&gt;first&lt;/em&gt; thing necessary to its solution is this: that Christianity is to be understood only by examining the soil from which it sprung—it is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; a reaction against Jewish instincts; it is their inevitable product; it is simply one more step in the awe-inspiring logic of the Jews. In the words of the Saviour, “salvation is of the Jews.”[4]—The &lt;em&gt;second&lt;/em&gt; thing to remember is this: that the psychological type of the Galilean is still to be recognized, but it was only in its most degenerate form (which is at once maimed and overladen with foreign features) that it could serve in the manner in which it has been used: as a type of the &lt;em&gt;Saviour&lt;/em&gt; of mankind.—&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Different forms of dissatisfaction.&lt;/em&gt; – The weak and, as it were, feminine discontented types are those who are innovative at making life more beautiful and profound; the strong discontents – the men among them, to stick with the metaphor – are innovative at making it better and safer. The former show their weakness and femininity by gladly letting themselves be deceived from time to time and occasionally resting content with a bit of intoxication and gushing enthusiasm, though they can never be satisfied entirely and suffer from the incurability of their dissatisfaction; they are also the promoters of all who know how to procure opiates and narcotic consolations, and consequently they resent those who esteem physicians above priests – thus they assure the &lt;em&gt;continuance&lt;/em&gt; of real distress! Had there not been a surplus of these discontents in Europe since the middle ages, the celebrated European capacity for constant &lt;em&gt;transformation&lt;/em&gt; might never have developed, for the demands of the strong discontents are too crude and basically too undemanding not eventually to be brought to a final rest. China, for example, is a country where large-scale discontentment and the capacity for &lt;em&gt;change&lt;/em&gt; became extinct centuries ago; and in Europe too the socialists and state idolaters, with their measures for making life better and safer, might easily establish Chinese conditions and a Chinese ‘happiness’, provided they are first able to extirpate that sicklier, more tender, more feminine discontentment and romanticism that is for the moment still superabundant here. Europe is a patient who owes the utmost gratitude to his incurability and to the perpetual changes in his affliction: these incessantly new conditions, these no less incessantly new dangers, pains, and modes of information have finally generated an intellectual irritability that approximates genius and that is in any case the mother of all genius.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The history of Israel is invaluable as a typical history of an attempt to &lt;em&gt;denaturize&lt;/em&gt; all natural values: I point to five facts which bear this out. Originally, and above all in the time of the monarchy, Israel maintained the &lt;em&gt;right&lt;/em&gt; attitude of things, which is to say, the natural attitude. Its Jahveh was an expression of its consciousness of power, its joy in itself, its hopes for itself: to him the Jews looked for victory and salvation and through him they expected nature to give them whatever was necessary to their existence—above all, rain. Jahveh is the god of Israel, and &lt;em&gt;consequently&lt;/em&gt; the god of justice: this is the logic of every race that has power in its hands and a good conscience in the use of it. In the religious ceremonial of the Jews both aspects of this self-approval stand revealed. The nation is grateful for the high destiny that has enabled it to obtain dominion; it is grateful for the benign procession of the seasons, and for the good fortune attending its herds and its crops.—This view of things remained an ideal for a long while, even after it had been robbed of validity by tragic blows: anarchy within and the Assyrian without. But the people still retained, as a projection of their highest yearnings, that vision of a king who was at once a gallant warrior and an upright judge—a vision best visualized in the typical prophet (&lt;em&gt;i. e.&lt;/em&gt;, critic and satirist of the moment), Isaiah.—But every hope remained unfulfilled. The old god no longer &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; do what he used to do. He ought to have been abandoned. But what actually happened? Simply this: the conception of him was &lt;em&gt;changed&lt;/em&gt;—the conception of him was &lt;em&gt;denaturized&lt;/em&gt;; this was the price that had to be paid for keeping him.—Jahveh, the god of “justice”—he is in accord with Israel &lt;em&gt;no more&lt;/em&gt;, he no longer vizualizes the national egoism; he is now a god only conditionally&amp;hellip;. The public notion of this god now becomes merely a weapon in the hands of clerical agitators, who interpret all happiness as a reward and all unhappiness as a punishment for obedience or disobedience to him, for “sin”: that most fraudulent of all imaginable interpretations, whereby a “moral order of the world” is set up, and the fundamental concepts, “cause” and “effect,” are stood on their heads. Once natural causation has been swept out of the world by doctrines of reward and punishment some sort of &lt;em&gt;un&lt;/em&gt;-natural causation becomes necessary: and all other varieties of the denial of nature follow it. A god who &lt;em&gt;demands&lt;/em&gt;—in place of a god who helps, who gives counsel, who is at bottom merely a name for every happy inspiration of courage and self-reliance&amp;hellip;. &lt;em&gt;Morality&lt;/em&gt; is no longer a reflection of the conditions which make for the sound life and development of the people; it is no longer the primary life-instinct; instead it has become abstract and in opposition to life—a fundamental perversion of the fancy, an “evil eye” on all things. &lt;em&gt;What&lt;/em&gt; is Jewish, &lt;em&gt;what&lt;/em&gt; is Christian morality? Chance robbed of its innocence; unhappiness polluted with the idea of “sin”; well-being represented as a danger, as a “temptation”; a physiological disorder produced by the canker worm of conscience&amp;hellip;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Not predestined for knowledge.&lt;/em&gt; – There is a stupid humility that is by no means rare, and those afflicted with it are altogether unfit to become votaries of knowledge. For as soon as a person of this type perceives something striking, he turns on his heel, as it were, and says to himself, ‘You have made a mistake! Where were your senses? This cannot be the truth!’ And then, instead of looking and listening more keenly again, he runs away, as if intimidated, from the striking thing and tries to shake it from his mind as fast as possible. For his inner canon says: ‘I want to see nothing that contradicts the prevalent opinion. Am &lt;em&gt;I&lt;/em&gt; made to discover new truths? There are already too many old ones.’&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Misunderstood sufferers.&lt;/em&gt; – Great natures suffer differently from what their admirers imagine: they suffer most severely from the ignoble, petty agitations of some evil moments – in short, from their doubts about their own greatness – and not from the sacrifices and martyrdoms that their task demands from them. As long as Prometheus has pity for men and sacrifices himself for them, he is happy and great; but when he is envious of Zeus and the homage paid to him by mortals, then he suffers!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The concept of god falsified; the concept of morality falsified;—but even here Jewish priest-craft did not stop. The whole history of Israel ceased to be of any value: out with it!—These priests accomplished that miracle of falsification of which a great part of the Bible is the documentary evidence; with a degree of contempt unparalleled, and in the face of all tradition and all historical reality, they translated the past of their people into &lt;em&gt;religious&lt;/em&gt; terms, which is to say, they converted it into an idiotic mechanism of salvation, whereby all offences against Jahveh were punished and all devotion to him was rewarded. We would regard this act of historical falsification as something far more shameful if familiarity with the &lt;em&gt;ecclesiastical&lt;/em&gt; interpretation of history for thousands of years had not blunted our inclinations for uprightness &lt;em&gt;in historicis&lt;/em&gt;. And the philosophers support the church: the &lt;em&gt;lie&lt;/em&gt; about a “moral order of the world” runs through the whole of philosophy, even the newest. What is the meaning of a “moral order of the world”? That there is a thing called the will of God which, once and for all time, determines what man ought to do and what he ought not to do; that the worth of a people, or of an individual thereof, is to be measured by the extent to which they or he obey this will of God; that the destinies of a people or of an individual are &lt;em&gt;controlled&lt;/em&gt; by this will of God, which rewards or punishes according to the degree of obedience manifested.—In place of all that pitiable lie &lt;em&gt;reality&lt;/em&gt; has this to say: the &lt;em&gt;priest&lt;/em&gt;, a parasitical variety of man who can exist only at the cost of every sound view of life, takes the name of God in vain: he calls that state of human society in which he himself determines the value of all things “the kingdom of God”; he calls the means whereby that state of affairs is attained “the will of God”; with cold-blooded cynicism he estimates all peoples, all ages and all individuals by the extent of their subservience or opposition to the power of the priestly order. One observes him at work: under the hand of the Jewish priesthood the &lt;em&gt;great&lt;/em&gt; age of Israel became an age of decline; the Exile, with its long series of misfortunes, was transformed into a &lt;em&gt;punishment&lt;/em&gt; for that great age—during which priests had not yet come into existence. Out of the powerful and &lt;em&gt;wholly free&lt;/em&gt; heroes of Israel’s history they fashioned, according to their changing needs, either wretched bigots and hypocrites or men entirely “godless.” They reduced every great event to the idiotic formula: “obedient &lt;em&gt;or&lt;/em&gt; disobedient to God.”—They went a step further: the “will of God” (in other words some means necessary for preserving the power of the priests) had to be &lt;em&gt;determined&lt;/em&gt;—and to this end they had to have a “revelation.” In plain English, a gigantic literary fraud had to be perpetrated, and “holy scriptures” had to be concocted—and so, with the utmost hierarchical pomp, and days of penance and much lamentation over the long days of “sin” now ended, they were duly published. The “will of God,” it appears, had long stood like a rock; the trouble was that mankind had neglected the “holy scriptures”&amp;hellip;. But the “will of God” had already been revealed to Moses&amp;hellip;. What happened? Simply this: the priest had formulated, once and for all time and with the strictest meticulousness, what tithes were to be paid to him, from the largest to the smallest (—not forgetting the most appetizing cuts of meat, for the priest is a great consumer of beefsteaks); in brief, he let it be known just &lt;em&gt;what he wanted&lt;/em&gt;, what “the will of God” was&amp;hellip;. From this time forward things were so arranged that the priest became &lt;em&gt;indispensable everywhere&lt;/em&gt;; at all the great natural events of life, at birth, at marriage, in sickness, at death, not to say at the “&lt;em&gt;sacrifice&lt;/em&gt;” (that is, at meal-times), the holy parasite put in his appearance, and proceeded to &lt;em&gt;denaturize&lt;/em&gt; it—in his own phrase, to “sanctify” it&amp;hellip;. For this should be noted: that every natural habit, every natural institution (the state, the administration of justice, marriage, the care of the sick and of the poor), everything demanded by the life-instinct, in short, everything that has any value &lt;em&gt;in itself&lt;/em&gt;, is reduced to absolute worthlessness and even made the &lt;em&gt;reverse&lt;/em&gt; of valuable by the parasitism of priests (or, if you chose, by the “moral order of the world”). The fact requires a sanction—a power to &lt;em&gt;grant values&lt;/em&gt; becomes necessary, and the only way it can create such values is by denying nature&amp;hellip;. The priest depreciates and desecrates nature: it is only at this price that he can exist at all.—Disobedience to God, which actually means to the priest, to “the law,” now gets the name of “sin”; the means prescribed for “reconciliation with God” are, of course, precisely the means which bring one most effectively under the thumb of the priest; he alone can “save”&amp;hellip;. Psychologically considered, “sins” are indispensable to every society organized on an ecclesiastical basis; they are the only reliable weapons of power; the priest &lt;em&gt;lives&lt;/em&gt; upon sins; it is necessary to him that there be “sinning”&amp;hellip;. Prime axiom: “God forgiveth him that repenteth”—in plain English, &lt;em&gt;him that submitteth to the priest&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;What is life?&lt;/em&gt; – Life – that is: continually shedding something that wants to die; Life – that is: being cruel and inexorable against anything that is growing weak and old in us, and not just in us. Life – therefore means: being devoid of respect for the dying, the wretched, the aged? Always being a murderer? And yet old Moses said: ‘Thou shalt not kill.’17&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Come.”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;And she led him across the lawn where the picnic blankets still lay as after a storm, tossed and half-furled, and some few dogs had arrived with the army ants while several cats waited for the beasts to leave, and Nef walked among them and opened the front door of the Egyptian View Arms and, ducking his head, blushing, Cardiff stepped in swiftly, but she was already at the stairs and halfway up before he touched the first riser, and then they were in her tower room and he looked and saw that her vast bed had been stripped and the windows thrown open wide with their wind-tossed curtains and the town clock was striking four in the afternoon as Nef lifted her arms and a great soft bloom of sheet rose in a summer cloud over the bed and he seized his half and with her gentled it down in a field of white over the bed to cover its face. And they stood back and watched the late afternoon exhale and fill the lace and blow the curtains inward toward the bed, like a fall of never-arriving snow, and there was a glass of lemonade on either bedside table, and his questioning look caused her to laugh and shake her head. Only lemonade, nothing more.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Christianity sprang from a soil so corrupt that on it everything natural, every natural value, every &lt;em&gt;reality&lt;/em&gt; was opposed by the deepest instincts of the ruling class—it grew up as a sort of war to the death upon reality, and as such it has never been surpassed. The “holy people,” who had adopted priestly values and priestly names for all things, and who, with a terrible logical consistency, had rejected everything of the earth as “unholy,” “worldly,” “sinful”—this people put its instinct into a final formula that was logical to the point of self-annihilation: as &lt;em&gt;Christianity&lt;/em&gt; it actually denied even the last form of reality, the “holy people,” the “chosen people,” &lt;em&gt;Jewish&lt;/em&gt; reality itself. The phenomenon is of the first order of importance: the small insurrectionary movement which took the name of Jesus of Nazareth is simply the Jewish instinct &lt;em&gt;redivivus&lt;/em&gt;—in other words, it is the priestly instinct come to such a pass that it can no longer endure the priest as a fact; it is the discovery of a state of existence even more fantastic than any before it, of a vision of life even more &lt;em&gt;unreal&lt;/em&gt; than that necessary to an ecclesiastical organization. Christianity actually &lt;em&gt;denies&lt;/em&gt; the church&amp;hellip;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The renouncer.&lt;/em&gt; – What does the renouncer do? He strives for a higher world, he wants to fly further and higher than all affirmers – &lt;em&gt;he throws away much&lt;/em&gt; that would encumber his flight, including some things that are not valueless, not disagreeable to him: he sacrifices it to his desire for the heights. This sacrificing, this throwing away, is now precisely what alone becomes visible in him and leads people to call him the renouncer, and thus he stands before us, shrouded in his hood as if he were the soul of a hairshirt. But he is quite satisfied with the impression that he makes on us: he wants to conceal from us his desire, his pride, his intention to soar &lt;em&gt;beyond&lt;/em&gt; us. Yes, he is cleverer than we thought, and so polite towards us – this affirmer! For he is just as we are even in his renunciation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;What is the seal of having become free’? – &lt;em&gt;No longer to be ashamed before oneself.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;1 Group of philosophers in the early fifth century BC who argued that the world of change was a mere appearance of an underlying unchanging being&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;2 The German word ‘Recht’ is usually ambiguous, meaning both ‘right’ and ‘law’. In this case it seems best to render it as ‘justice’.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;3 Ariston lived in the third century BC. This is fragment number 359 in &lt;em&gt;Stoicorum veterum fragmenta,&lt;/em&gt; ed. von Arnim.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;For the new year.&lt;/em&gt; – I’m still alive; I still think: I must still be alive because I still have to think. *Sum, ergo cogito: cogito, ergo sum.*1 Today everyone allows himself to express his dearest wish and thoughts: so I, too, want to say what I wish from myself today and what thought first crossed my heart – what thought shall be the reason, warrant, and sweetness of the rest of my life! I want to learn more and more how to see what is necessary in things as what is beautiful in them – thus I will be one of those who make things beautiful. *Amor fati:*2 let that be my love from now on! I do not want to wage war against ugliness. I do not want to accuse; I do not even want to accuse the accusers. Let &lt;em&gt;looking away&lt;/em&gt; be my only negation! And, all in all and on the whole: some day I want only to be a Yes-sayer!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Personal providence.&lt;/em&gt; – There is a certain high point in life; once we have reached it we are, for all our freedom, once more in the greatest danger of spiritual unfreedom; and no matter how much we have confronted the beautiful chaos of existence and denied it all providential reason and goodness, we still have to pass our hardest test. For it is only now that the thought of a personal providence confronts us with the most penetrating force and the best advocate, appearance, speaks for it – now that we so palpably see how everything that befalls us continually &lt;em&gt;turns out for the best.&lt;/em&gt; Every day and every hour life seems to want nothing else than to prove this proposition again and again; be it what it may – bad or good weather, the loss of a friend, a sickness, slander, the absence of a letter, the spraining of an ankle, a glance into a shop, a counterargument, the opening of a book, a dream, fraud – it shows itself immediately or very soon to be something that ‘was not allowed to be lacking’ – it is full of deep meaning and use precisely &lt;em&gt;for us!&lt;/em&gt; Is there any more dangerous seduction than to renounce one’s faith in the gods of Epicurus,3 those carefree and unknown ones, and to believe instead in some petty deity who is full of worries and personally knows every little hair on our heads and finds nothing nauseating in the most miserable small service? Well – I mean in spite of it all! – we should leave the gods alone as well as the genies at our service and be content with the assumption that our own practical and theoretical skill in interpreting and arranging events has now reached its apex. Nor should we think too highly of this dexterity of our wisdom when at times the wonderful harmony created by the playing of our instrument surprises us all too much – a harmony that sounds too good for us to dare to give credit to ourselves. Indeed, now and then someone plays &lt;em&gt;with&lt;/em&gt; us – good old chance; occasionally chance guides our hand, and the wisest providence could not invent music more beautiful than what our foolish hand then produces.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The thought of death.&lt;/em&gt; – It gives me a melancholy happiness to live in the midst of this jumble of lanes, needs, and voices: how much enjoyment, impatience, desire; how much thirsty life and drunkenness of life comes to light every moment of the day! And yet things will soon be so silent for all these noisy, living, life-thirsty ones! How even now everyone’s shadow stands behind him, as his dark fellow traveller! It’s always like the last moment before the departure of an emigrant ship: people have more to say to each other than ever; the hour is late; the ocean and its desolate silence await impatiently behind all the noise – so covetous, so certain of its prey. And everyone, everyone takes the past to be little or nothing while the near future is everything; hence this haste, this clamour, this outshouting and out-hustling one another. Everyone wants to be the first in this future – and yet death and deathly silence are the only things certain and common to all in this future! How strange that this sole certainty and commonality barely makes an impression on people and that they are &lt;em&gt;farthest&lt;/em&gt; removed from feeling like a brotherhood of death! It makes me happy to see that people do not at all want to think the thought of death! I would very much like to do something that would make the thought of life even a hundred times more &lt;em&gt;worth being thought&lt;/em&gt; to them.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Star friendship.&lt;/em&gt; – We were friends and have become estranged. But that was right, and we do not want to hide and obscure it from ourselves as if we had to be ashamed of it. We are two ships, each of which has its own goal and course; we may cross and have a feast together, as we did – and then the good ships lay so quietly in one harbour and in one sun that it may have seemed as if they had already completed their course and had the same goal. But then the almighty force of our projects drove us apart once again, into different seas and sunny zones, and maybe we will never meet again – or maybe we will, but will not recognize each other: the different seas and suns have changed us! That we had to become estranged is the law &lt;em&gt;above&lt;/em&gt; us; through it we should come to have more respect for each other – and the thought of our former friendship should become more sacred! There is probably a tremendous invisible curve and stellar orbit in which our different ways and goals may be &lt;em&gt;included&lt;/em&gt; as small stretches – let us rise to this thought! But our life is too short and our vision too meagre for us to be more than friends in the sense of that sublime possibility. – Let us then &lt;em&gt;believe&lt;/em&gt; in our star friendship even if we must be earth enemies.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;He slept and he dreamed.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;He was on the train, going east, and then suddenly he was in Chicago, and even more suddenly, he was in front of the Art Institute and was going up the stairs and through the corridors to stand before the great &lt;em&gt;Sunday in the Park&lt;/em&gt; painting.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A woman was standing by the painting and she turned and it was his fiancée.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As he watched, she grew older, aging before his eyes, and she said to him, “You’ve changed.”&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;As to whether he himself was conscious of this contradiction—whether, in fact, this was the only contradiction he was cognizant of—that is quite another question. Here, for the first time, I touch upon the problem of the &lt;em&gt;psychology of the Saviour&lt;/em&gt;.—I confess, to begin with, that there are very few books which offer me harder reading than the Gospels. My difficulties are quite different from those which enabled the learned curiosity of the German mind to achieve one of its most unforgettable triumphs. It is a long while since I, like all other young scholars, enjoyed with all the sapient laboriousness of a fastidious philologist the work of the incomparable Strauss.[5] At that time I was twenty years old: now I am too serious for that sort of thing. What do I care for the contradictions of “tradition”? How can any one call pious legends “traditions”? The histories of saints present the most dubious variety of literature in existence; to examine them by the scientific method, &lt;em&gt;in the entire absence of corroborative documents&lt;/em&gt;, seems to me to condemn the whole inquiry from the start—it is simply learned idling&amp;hellip;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Harming with what is best in oneself.&lt;/em&gt; – At times our strengths propel us so far ahead that we can no longer stand our weaknesses and perish from them. We may even foresee this outcome and still will have it no other way. Thus we become hard against that within us that wants to be spared, and our greatness is also our mercilessness. Such an experience, for which we must in the end pay with our lives, is a parable for the whole effect of great human beings on others and on their age: precisely with what is best in them, with what only they can do, they destroy many who are weak, insecure, in the process of becoming, of willing, and thus they are harmful. It can even happen that, all in all, they are harmful only because what is best in them is accepted and as it were imbibed only by those whom it affects like an overly potent drink: they lose their mind and their selfishness; they become so intoxicated that they are bound to break their limbs on all the wrong paths down which their intoxication drives them.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Architecture for those who wish to pursue knowledge.&lt;/em&gt; – One day, and probably soon, we will need some recognition of what is missing primarily in our big cities: quiet and wide, expansive places for reflection – places with long, high-ceilinged arcades for bad or all-too-sunny weather, where no shouts or noise from carriages can penetrate and where refined manners would prohibit even priests from praying aloud: a whole complex of buildings and sites that would give expression to the sublimity of contemplation and of stepping aside. The time is past when the Church had a monopoly on contemplation, when the &lt;em&gt;vita contemplativa4&lt;/em&gt; always had to be first and foremost a &lt;em&gt;vita religiosa:5&lt;/em&gt; and everything built by the Church gives expression to that idea. I do not see how we could make do with those buildings, even if they were stripped of their churchly purposes; as houses of God and spaces for ostentatiously displaying our intercourse with the World-Beyond, these buildings speak much that is too emotional and too partisan for us godless ones to be able to think &lt;em&gt;our thoughts&lt;/em&gt; here. We want to have &lt;em&gt;us&lt;/em&gt; translated into stone and plants; we want to take walks &lt;em&gt;in us&lt;/em&gt; when we stroll through these hallways and gardens.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Knowing how to end.&lt;/em&gt; – Masters of the first rank are recognized by the fact that in matters great and small they know how to find an end perfectly, be it the end of a melody or a thought; of a tragedy’s fifth act or an act of state. The best of the second rank always get restless toward the end, and do not fall into the sea with such proud and calm balance as do, for example, the mountains at Portofino – where the bay of Genoa finishes its melody.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Gait.&lt;/em&gt; – There are certain tricks of the spirit by which even great minds betray that they come from the mob or half-mob; the gait and stride of their thoughts especially plays the traitor: they cannot &lt;em&gt;walk.&lt;/em&gt; Thus Napoleon too, was unable, to his great vexation, to walk in a princely and ‘legitimate’ fashion on occasions that really demanded it, such as great coronation processions; even there, he was always just the leader of a column – proud and hasty at the same time, and very conscious of it. It is laughable to behold those authors who make the ruffled robes of long sentences rustle about themselves: they are trying to hide their &lt;em&gt;feet.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Preparatory human beings.&lt;/em&gt; – I welcome all the signs of a more virile, warlike age approaching that will above all restore honour to bravery! For it shall pave the way for a still higher age and gather the strength that the latter will need one day – the age that will carry heroism into the search for knowledge and &lt;em&gt;wage wars&lt;/em&gt; for the sake of thoughts and their consequences. To this end we now need many preparatory brave human beings who surely cannot spring from nothingness any more than from the sand and slime of present-day civilization and urbanization: human beings who know how to be silent, lonely, determined, and satisfied and steadfast in invisible activities; human beings profoundly predisposed to look, in all things, for what must be &lt;em&gt;overcome;&lt;/em&gt; human beings whose cheerfulness, patience, modesty, and contempt for great vanities is just as distinctive as their magnanimity in victory and patience with the small vanities of the defeated; human beings with a sharp and free judgement concerning all victors and the share of chance in every victory and glory; human beings with their own festivals, their own working days, their own periods of mourning, accustomed to command with assurance and equally prepared, when called for, to obey – in each case, equally proud, equally serving their own cause; more endangered, more fruitful, happier human beings! For – believe me – the secret for harvesting from existence the greatest fruitfulness and the greatest enjoyment is – &lt;em&gt;to live dangerously!&lt;/em&gt; Build your cities on the slopes of Vesuvius! Send your ships into uncharted seas! Live at war with your peers and yourselves! Be robbers and conquerors as long as you cannot be rulers and possessors, you seekers of knowledge! Soon the time will be past in which you had to be content living hidden in forests like shy deer! Finally the search for knowledge will reach for its due; it will want to rule and possess, and you with it!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Faith in oneself.&lt;/em&gt; – Few people have faith in themselves – and of these few, some possess it as a useful blindness or partial eclipse of the mind (what would they behold if they could see the bottom of themselves!), while the rest have to acquire it. Everything good, fine, or great they do is first of all an argument against the sceptic inside them. They have to convince or persuade &lt;em&gt;him,&lt;/em&gt; and that almost requires genius. These are the great self-dissatisfied people.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Excelsior&lt;/em&gt;.6 – ‘You will never pray again, never adore again, never again rest in endless trust; you refuse to let yourself stop to unharness your thoughts before any ultimate wisdom, goodness, or power; you have no perpetual guard and friend for your seven solitudes; you live without the view of a mountain-range with snow-capped peaks and fire in its heart; there is no avenger for you anymore, no final corrector of the text of your life; there is no more reason in what happens, no love in what will happen to you; no more resting place stands open for your heart in which to find and no longer seek; you arm yourself against any ultimate peace; you will the eternal recurrence of war and peace; – Man of renunciation, all of this you wish to renounce? Who will give you the strength to do so? No one yet has had the strength!’ There is a lake that one day refused to let itself flow off and formed a dam where it used to flow off: ever since, this lake rises higher and higher. Perhaps this very renunciation will lend us the strength to bear renunciation; perhaps man will rise ever higher when he no longer &lt;em&gt;flows off&lt;/em&gt; into a god.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;High spirits.&lt;/em&gt; – It seems to me that most people simply do not believe in elevated moods, unless it be for moments or fifteen-minute intervals at most – except for those few who experience an elevated feeling over a longer period. But to be the human being of one elevated feeling, the embodiment of a single great mood, has hitherto been a mere dream and enchanting possibility; as yet, history does not offer us any certain examples of it. Nevertheless history might one day beget such people, too, given the creation and determination of a great many preconditions that even the dice rolls of the luckiest chance could not put together today. Perhaps the usual state for these souls would be what has so far entered our souls only as an occasional exception that made us shudder: a perpetual movement between high and low and the feeling of high and low; a continual sense of ascending stairs and at the same time of resting on clouds.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Get on the ships!&lt;/em&gt; – If one considers how an overall philosophical justification of one’s way of living and thinking affects each individual – namely, like a sun, warming, blessing, impregnating, shining especially for him; how it makes him independent of praise and blame, self-sufficient, rich, generous with happiness and good will; how it incessantly turns evil into good, brings all forces to bloom and ripen and keeps the petty, great weed of melancholy and moroseness from coming up at all – one exclaims longingly, in the end: Oh, how I wish that many such new suns would yet be created! Even the evil man, the unhappy man, and the exceptional man should have their philosophy, their good right, their sunshine! Pity for them is not what is needed! We have to unlearn this arrogant notion, however long humanity has spent learning and practising it – we do not need to present them with confessors, conjurers of souls, and forgivers of sins; rather, a new &lt;em&gt;justice&lt;/em&gt; is needed! And a new motto! And new philosophers! The moral earth, too, is round! The moral earth, too, has its antipodes! The antipodes, too, have their right to exist! There is another world to discover – and more than one! On to the ships, you philosophers!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;What concerns &lt;em&gt;me&lt;/em&gt; is the psychological type of the Saviour. This type might be depicted in the Gospels, in however mutilated a form and however much overladen with extraneous characters—that is, in &lt;em&gt;spite&lt;/em&gt; of the Gospels; just as the figure of Francis of Assisi shows itself in his legends in spite of his legends. It is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; a question of mere truthful evidence as to what he did, what he said and how he actually died; the question is, whether his type is still conceivable, whether it has been handed down to us.—All the attempts that I know of to read the &lt;em&gt;history&lt;/em&gt; of a “soul” in the Gospels seem to me to reveal only a lamentable psychological levity. M. Renan, that mountebank &lt;em&gt;in psychologicus&lt;/em&gt;, has contributed the two most &lt;em&gt;unseemly&lt;/em&gt; notions to this business of explaining the type of Jesus: the notion of the &lt;em&gt;genius&lt;/em&gt; and that of the &lt;em&gt;hero&lt;/em&gt; (“&lt;em&gt;héros&lt;/em&gt;”). But if there is anything essentially unevangelical, it is surely the concept of the hero. What the Gospels make instinctive is precisely the reverse of all heroic struggle, of all taste for conflict: the very incapacity for resistance is here converted into something moral: (“resist not evil!”—the most profound sentence in the Gospels, perhaps the true key to them), to wit, the blessedness of peace, of gentleness, the &lt;em&gt;inability&lt;/em&gt; to be an enemy. What is the meaning of “glad tidings”?—The true life, the life eternal has been found—it is not merely promised, it is here, it is in &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt;; it is the life that lies in love free from all retreats and exclusions, from all keeping of distances. Every one is the child of God—Jesus claims nothing for himself alone—as the child of God each man is the equal of every other man&amp;hellip;. Imagine making Jesus a &lt;em&gt;hero&lt;/em&gt;!—And what a tremendous misunderstanding appears in the word “genius”! Our whole conception of the “spiritual,” the whole conception of our civilization, could have had no meaning in the world that Jesus lived in. In the strict sense of the physiologist, a quite different word ought to be used here&amp;hellip;. We all know that there is a morbid sensibility of the tactile nerves which causes those suffering from it to recoil from every touch, and from every effort to grasp a solid object. Brought to its logical conclusion, such a physiological &lt;em&gt;habitus&lt;/em&gt; becomes an instinctive hatred of all reality, a flight into the “intangible,” into the “incomprehensible”; a distaste for all formulae, for all conceptions of time and space, for everything established—customs, institutions, the church—; a feeling of being at home in a world in which no sort of reality survives, a merely “inner” world, a “true” world, an “eternal” world&amp;hellip;. “The Kingdom of God is within &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt;”&amp;hellip;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The add-on-liars.&lt;/em&gt; – When people in France started to fight the Aristotelian unities18 and others consequently also started to defend them, one could see again something that is so often apparent but that people are loath to see: &lt;em&gt;one lied to oneself,&lt;/em&gt; inventing reasons for these laws, simply to avoid admitting that one had become &lt;em&gt;used&lt;/em&gt; to them and would no longer have it any other way. And that is what one does, and has always done, within every prevailing morality and religion: the reasons and intents behind habits are invented only when some people start attacking the habits and &lt;em&gt;asking&lt;/em&gt; for reasons and intents. Here we have the great dishonesty of conservatives of all times – they are the add-on-liars.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;One thing is needful.&lt;/em&gt; – To ‘give style’ to one’s character – a great and rare art! It is practised by those who survey all the strengths and weaknesses that their nature has to offer and then fit them into an artistic plan until each appears as art and reason and even weaknesses delight the eye. Here a great mass of second nature has been added; there a piece of first nature removed – both times through long practice and daily work at it. Here the ugly that could not be removed is concealed; there it is reinterpreted into sublimity. Much that is vague and resisted shaping has been saved and employed for distant views – it is supposed to beckon towards the remote and immense. In the end, when the work is complete, it becomes clear how it was the force of a single taste that ruled and shaped everything great and small – whether the taste was good or bad means less than one may think; it’s enough that it was one taste! It will be the strong and domineering natures who experience their most exquisite pleasure under such coercion, in being bound by but also perfected under their own law; the passion of their tremendous will becomes less intense in the face of all stylized nature, all conquered and serving nature; even when they have palaces to build and gardens to design, they resist giving nature free rein. Conversely, it is the weak characters with no power over themselves who &lt;em&gt;hate&lt;/em&gt; the constraint of style: they feel that if this bitterly evil compulsion were to be imposed on them, they would have to become &lt;em&gt;commonplace&lt;/em&gt; under it – they become slaves as soon as they serve; they hate to serve. Such minds – and they may be of the first rank – are always out to shape or interpret their environment as &lt;em&gt;free&lt;/em&gt; nature – wild, arbitrary, fantastic, disorderly, and surprising – and they are well advised to do so, because only thus do they please themselves! For one thing is needful: that a human being should &lt;em&gt;attain&lt;/em&gt; satisfaction with himself – be it through this or that poetry or art; only then is a human being at all tolerable to behold! Whoever is dissatisfied with himself is continually prepared to avenge himself for this, and we others will be his victims if only by having to endure his sight. For the sight of something ugly makes one bad and gloomy.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Genoa.&lt;/em&gt; – I have been looking at this city for a long time, at its villas and pleasure-gardens and the wide circumference of its inhabited heights and slopes, and in the end I must say: I see &lt;em&gt;faces&lt;/em&gt; that belong to past generations; this region is dotted with images of bold and autocratic human beings. They have &lt;em&gt;lived&lt;/em&gt; and wish to live on – that is what they are telling me with their houses, built and adorned to last for centuries and not for the fleeting hour: they were well disposed towards life, however badly disposed they often may have been towards themselves. I keep seeing the builder, how he rests his gaze on everything built near and afar as well as on city, sea, and mountain contours, and how with his gaze he is perpetrating acts of violence and conquest: he wants to fit all this into &lt;em&gt;his&lt;/em&gt; plan and finally make it his &lt;em&gt;possession&lt;/em&gt; by incorporating it into his plan. The whole region is overgrown with this magnificent, insatiable lust for possessions and spoils; and even as these people heeded no boundaries in distant lands and, in their thirst for what was new, placed a new world beside the old one, so, too, at home each flared up against the other and found a way to express his superiority and place his personal infinity between himself and his neighbour. Each conquered his homeland again for himself by overwhelming it with his architectural ideas and refashioning it, so to speak, into a house that was a feast for his eyes. In the North one is impressed by the law and by the general delight in lawfulness and obedience as one considers the way cities are built: this allows one to recognize the inner propensity to uniformity and conformism which must have dominated the souls of all the builders. But here you find, upon turning every corner, a separate human being who knows the sea, adventure, and the Orient; a human being averse to the law and to the neighbour as to a kind of boredom, who measures everything old and established with envious eyes: he would, with a marvellous cunning of imagination, like to establish all this anew at least in thought; to put his hand to it, his meaning into it – if only for the moment of a sunny afternoon when his insatiable and melancholy soul feels sated for once, and only what is his own and nothing alien may appear to his eye.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;To the preachers of morals.&lt;/em&gt; – I do not want to moralize, but to those who do, I give this advice: if you want eventually to deprive the best things and situations of all their worth, then keep talking about them the way you have been! Place them at the top of your morality and talk from morning till night about the bliss of happiness, the tranquillity of the soul, about justice and immanent retribution – the way you carry on, all these good things will finally attain a popularity and street-clamour of their own, but at the same time all the gold that was on them will have worn off through handling, and all the gold &lt;em&gt;inside&lt;/em&gt; will have turned to lead. Verily, you know the art of alchemy in reverse, the devaluation of what is most valuable! Sometime you should try a different prescription to avoid reaching the opposite of what you seek, as you have so far: &lt;em&gt;deny&lt;/em&gt; these good things; withdraw from them the mob’s acclaim and their easy currency; make them once again the hidden modesty of solitary souls; say that &lt;em&gt;morality is something forbidden!&lt;/em&gt; That way you might win over for these things the kind of people who alone matter; I mean the &lt;em&gt;heroic.&lt;/em&gt; But then there must be something in them that provokes fear and not, as hitherto, disgust! Isn’t it time to say of morality what Master Eckhart said: ‘I ask God to rid me of God!’8&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Our air.&lt;/em&gt; – We know it very well: to those who glance at science as if passing it on a walk, in the manner of women and unfortunately also many artists, the severity of its service – this inexorability in matters great and small, this swiftness in weighing, judging, and passing judgement – has something dizzying and fear-inspiring. What frightens them especially is how the hardest is demanded and the best done despite the absence of praise and awards; rather, as among soldiers, what one mostly hears is almost exclusively reproaches and sharp reprimands – for doing things well is considered the rule, and failure the exception; yet here as everywhere else, the rule has a reticent mouth. Now this ‘severity of science’ has something in common with the form and decorum of the very best society: it frightens the uninitiated. But someone accustomed to it wants to live nowhere else than in this bright, transparent, strongly electric air – in this &lt;em&gt;masculine&lt;/em&gt; air. Anywhere else is not clean and airy enough for him: he suspects that &lt;em&gt;there,&lt;/em&gt; his best art would be of no real use to anyone and of no delight to himself; that among misunderstandings half his life would slip through his fingers; that much caution, much concealment and restraint would constantly be called for – ways of having large amounts of one’s strength sapped uselessly! But in &lt;em&gt;this&lt;/em&gt; severe and clear element he has his full strength: here he can fly! Why descend into those murky waters where one has to swim and wade and sully one’s wings? No, it’s too hard for us to live there; it’s not our fault that we were born for the air, for clean air, we rivals of the light beam, and that we would prefer to ride on specks of ether, like it – not away from the sun but &lt;em&gt;towards the sun!&lt;/em&gt; That, however, we cannot do. So let us do all we can do: bring light to the earth; be ‘the light of the earth’! And for that, we have our wings and our speed and our severity; for that, we are masculine and even terrifying, like fire. May those be terrified of us who do not know how to gain warmth and light from us!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Against the slanderers of nature.&lt;/em&gt; – I find those people unpleasant in whom every natural inclination immediately becomes a sickness, something disfiguring or even contemptible – &lt;em&gt;they&lt;/em&gt; have seduced us into the belief that man’s natural inclinations are evil; &lt;em&gt;they&lt;/em&gt; are the cause of our great injustice towards our nature, towards &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; nature! There are enough people who could well entrust themselves to their inclinations with grace and without care, but who do not for fear of the imagined ‘evil essence’ of nature! &lt;em&gt;That&lt;/em&gt; is why there is so little nobility among human beings; its distinguishing feature has always been to have no fear of oneself, to expect nothing contemptible from oneself, to fly without misgivings wherever we’re inclined – we free-born birds! And wherever we arrive, there will always be freedom and sunlight around us.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Brief habits.&lt;/em&gt; – I love brief habits and consider them invaluable means for getting to know &lt;em&gt;many&lt;/em&gt; things and states down to the bottom of their sweetnesses and bitternesses; my nature is designed entirely for brief habits, even in the needs of its physical health and generally &lt;em&gt;as far as&lt;/em&gt; I can see at all, from the lowest to the highest. I always believe &lt;em&gt;this&lt;/em&gt; will give me lasting satisfaction – even brief habits have this faith of passion, this faith in eternity – and that I am to be envied for having found and recognized it, and now it nourishes me at noon and in the evening and spreads a deep contentment around itself and into me, so that I desire nothing else, without having to compare, despise, or hate. And one day its time is up; the good thing parts from me, not as something that now disgusts me but peacefully and sated with me, as I with it, and as if we ought to be grateful to each other and so shake hands to say farewell. And already the new waits at the door along with my faith – the indestructible fool and sage! – that this new thing will be the right thing, the last right thing. This happens to me with dishes, thoughts, people, cities, poems, music, doctrines, daily schedules, and ways of living. &lt;em&gt;Enduring&lt;/em&gt; habits, however, I hate, and feel as if a tyrant has come near me and the air around me is &lt;em&gt;thickening&lt;/em&gt; when events take a shape that seems inevitably to produce enduring habits – for instance, owing to an official position, constant relations with the same people, a permanent residence, or uniquely good health. Yes, at the very bottom of my soul I am grateful to all my misery and illnesses and whatever is imperfect in me because they provide a hundred back doors through which I can escape enduring habits. To me the most intolerable, the truly terrible, would of course be a life entirely without habits, a life that continually demanded improvisation – that would be my exile and my Siberia.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A firm reputation.&lt;/em&gt; – A firm reputation used to be a thing of utmost utility; and wherever society is still ruled by herd mentality it is still today most expedient for everyone to &lt;em&gt;act&lt;/em&gt; as if his character and occupation are unchangeable, even if basically they are not. ‘One can depend on him; he stays the same’: wherever society is threatened this is the type of praise that means the most. Society sees in this person’s virtue, in that person’s ambition, in the thoughtfulness and passion of a third dependable ever-handy &lt;em&gt;instruments.&lt;/em&gt; This is a source of great gratification to society, and it bestows on this &lt;em&gt;instrument-nature,&lt;/em&gt; this staying-true-to-oneself, this immutability in views, aspirations, and even vices its highest honours. Such esteem, which blooms and has bloomed everywhere alongside the morality of custom (&lt;em&gt;Sittlichkeit der Sitte),&lt;/em&gt; fosters ‘character’ and brings all change, re-learning, and self-transformation into &lt;em&gt;ill repute.&lt;/em&gt; However great the advantages of this mentality may be elsewhere, to the &lt;em&gt;search for knowledge&lt;/em&gt; it is the most harmful kind of general judgement, for it condemns and discredits the willingness which a seeker after knowledge must have to declare himself &lt;em&gt;against&lt;/em&gt; his previous opinion and to mistrust anything that wishes to become &lt;em&gt;firm&lt;/em&gt; in us. The attitude of the seeker after knowledge, which is incompatible with a ‘firm reputation’, is considered &lt;em&gt;dishonourable&lt;/em&gt; while the petrifaction of opinions has all the honour to itself – still today we must live under the spell of such standards! How hard living is when one feels the judgement of many millennia against and around oneself! It is probable that the search for knowledge was afflicted for many millennia with a bad conscience and that there must have been much self-contempt and secret misery in the history of the greatest spirits.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Being able to contradict.&lt;/em&gt; – Everybody knows now that being able to stand contradiction is a high sign of culture. Some even know that the higher human being desires and invites contradiction in order to receive a hint about his own injustice of which he is as yet unaware. But the &lt;em&gt;ability to&lt;/em&gt; contradict, the acquired &lt;em&gt;good&lt;/em&gt; conscience accompanying hostility towards what is familiar, traditional, hallowed – that is better yet than both those abilities, and constitutes what is really great, new, and amazing in our culture; it is the step of all steps of the liberated spirit: who knows that?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;What one should learn from artists.&lt;/em&gt; – What means do we have for making things beautiful, attractive, and desirable when they are not? And in themselves I think they never are! Here we have something to learn from physicians, when for example they dilute something bitter or add wine and sugar to the mixing bowl; but even more from artists, who are really constantly out to invent new artistic &lt;em&gt;tours de force&lt;/em&gt; of this kind. To distance oneself from things until there is much in them that one no longer sees and much that the eye must add &lt;em&gt;in order to see them at all,&lt;/em&gt; or to see things around a corner and as if they were cut out and extracted from their context, or to place them so that each partially distorts the view one has of the others and allows only perspectival glimpses, or to look at them through coloured glass or in the light of the sunset, or to give them a surface and skin that is not fully transparent: all this we should learn from artists while otherwise being wiser than they. For usually in their case this delicate power stops where art ends and life begins; &lt;em&gt;we,&lt;/em&gt; however, want to be poets of our lives, starting with the smallest and most commonplace details.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;– One might guess that I do not want to take my leave ungratefully from that time of severe illness whose profits I have not yet exhausted even today: I am well aware of the advantages that my erratic health gives me over all burly minds. A philosopher who has passed through many kinds of health, and keeps passing through them again and again, has passed through an equal number of philosophies; he simply &lt;em&gt;cannot&lt;/em&gt; but translate his state every time into the most spiritual form and distance – this art of transfiguration just &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; philosophy. We philosophers are not free to separate soul from body as the common people do; we are even less free to separate soul from spirit. We are no thinking frogs, no objectifying and registering devices with frozen innards – we must constantly give birth to our thoughts out of our pain and maternally endow them with all that we have of blood, heart, fire, pleasure, passion, agony, conscience, fate, and disaster. Life – to us, that means constantly transforming all that we are into light and flame, and also all that wounds us; we simply &lt;em&gt;can do&lt;/em&gt; no other. And as for illness: are we not almost tempted to ask whether we can do without it at all? Only great pain is the liberator of the spirit, as the teacher of &lt;em&gt;the great suspicion&lt;/em&gt; that turns every U into an X,4 a real, proper X,4 that is, the penultimate one before the final one. Only great pain, that long, slow pain that takes its time and in which we are burned, as it were, over green wood, forces us philosophers to descend into our ultimate depths and put aside all trust, everything good-natured, veiling, mild, average – things in which formerly we may have found our humanity. I doubt that such pain makes us ‘better’ – but I know that it makes us &lt;em&gt;deeper.&lt;/em&gt; Whether we learn to pit our pride, our scorn, our willpower against it, like the savage who, however badly tormented, repays his tormentor with the malice of his tongue; or whether we withdraw before pain into the Oriental Nothingness – called Nirvana – into mute, rigid, deaf self-surrender, self-forgetting, self-extinction: one emerges from such dangerous exercises in self-mastery as a different person, with a few more question marks, above all with the &lt;em&gt;will&lt;/em&gt; henceforth to question further, more deeply, severely, harshly, evilly, and quietly than one had previously questioned. The trust in life is gone: life itself has become a &lt;em&gt;problem.&lt;/em&gt; Yet one should not jump to the conclusion that this necessarily makes one sullen. Even love of life is still possible – only one loves differently. It is like the love for a woman who gives us doubts&amp;hellip;But the attraction of everything problematic, the delight in an X, is so great in highly spiritual, spiritualized people such as these that this delight flares up like bright embers again and again over all the distress of what is problematic, over all the danger of uncertainty, and even over the jealousy of the lover. We know a new happiness&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Chapter Three&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;After three and a half years in Kerala I was transferred back to Tamil Nadu, to work under the rather severe chief accountant of the Salem branch, Mr. S. Venkata Subrahmanian. As it is common usage for educated English-speaking Tamils to be addressed by the first initials of their names, he was known to one and all as SVS.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;My two good “same-age” friends were co-workers Vaidyanathan, serious, bespectacled and a bit shy, and Shankara Subrahmania, a jolly, big-bodied chap. The first six months I lived alone in a small rented room; after that I shared a place with Shankara until the spring of 1974.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;My first lecture was intended to remove the prejudice that India is and always must be a strange country to us, and that those who have to live there will find themselves stranded, and far away from that living stream of thoughts and interests which carries us along in England and in other countries of Europe.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;My second lecture was directed against another prejudice, namely, that the people of India with whom the young civil servants will have to pass the best years of their life are a race so depraved morally, and more particularly so devoid of any regard for truth, that they &lt;em&gt;must&lt;/em&gt; always remain strangers to us, and that any real fellowship or friendship with them is quite out of the question.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;At the train station, there were sunflowers out on the track. Someone had been there ahead of him and if it was Elias Culpepper, he never knew.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The train stopped this time, and he got on and as he bought a ticket from the conductor he asked, “Do you remember me?”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The man looked at his face intently, scowled, and looked again and said, “Can’t say I do.”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;And the train gathered steam and chugged away from the station and Summerton, Arizona, was left behind.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The comedy of the famous.&lt;/em&gt; – Famous men who &lt;em&gt;need&lt;/em&gt; their fame, e.g. all politicians, never choose allies and friends without ulterior motives: from one they want a piece of the splendour and reflected splendour of his virtue; from another the fear-inspiring aspects of certain dubious qualities that everyone knows him to have; from another they steal the reputation of his idleness, his lying in the sun, because it serves their own ends to appear inattentive and sluggish at times – it conceals the fact that they actually lie in wait; now they need a visionary around; now an expert; now a thinker; now a pedant, as if he were their present self; but just as quickly they don’t need them any more! And so the surroundings and exteriors of famous men die off continually, even while everything seems to be pushing to get into these surroundings and lend them their character; in this, they are like big cities. Their reputation is continually changing, like their character, for their changing methods demand these changes and push forward now this, now that real or fictitious characteristic onto the stage. Their friends and allies belong, as I said, to these stage properties. What they want, however, must stand all the much more firmly and unshakeably and be splendidly seen from afar; and this, too, sometimes requires its comedy and its theatrics.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Preludes to science&lt;/em&gt; – So you believe the sciences would have emerged and matured, if they had not been preceded by magicians, alchemists, astrologers, and witches who with their promises and false claims created a thirst, hunger, and taste for &lt;em&gt;hidden and forbidden&lt;/em&gt; powers? Indeed, infinitely more has had to be &lt;em&gt;promised&lt;/em&gt; than can ever be fulfilled in order that anything at all be fulfilled in the realm of knowledge. Those things which now appear to us to be preludes and exercises preparatory to science were in the past certainly not practised and felt to be any such thing. Similarly perhaps to a distant age the whole of &lt;em&gt;religion&lt;/em&gt; will appear as an exercise and prelude. Perhaps religion could have been the strange means of making it possible one day for a few individuals to enjoy the whole self-sufficiency of a god and all his power of self-redemption. Indeed – one may ask – would man ever have learned to feel hunger for &lt;em&gt;himself&lt;/em&gt; and to find satisfaction and fullness in &lt;em&gt;himself&lt;/em&gt; without this religious training and prehistory? Did Prometheus9 first have to &lt;em&gt;imagine&lt;/em&gt; having &lt;em&gt;stolen&lt;/em&gt; light and pay for it before he could finally discover that he had created light &lt;em&gt;by desiring light,&lt;/em&gt; and that not only man but also &lt;em&gt;god&lt;/em&gt; was the work of &lt;em&gt;his own&lt;/em&gt; hands and clay in his hands? All mere images of the sculptor – no less than delusion, theft, the Caucasus, the vulture, and the whole tragic &lt;em&gt;Prometheia&lt;/em&gt; of all those who know?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Delusion of the contemplative ones.&lt;/em&gt; – Higher human beings distinguish themselves from the lower by seeing and hearing, and &lt;em&gt;thoughtfully&lt;/em&gt; seeing and hearing, immeasurably more – and just this distinguishes human beings from animals, and the higher animals from the lower. The world becomes ever fuller for someone who grows into the height of humanity; ever more baited hooks to attract his interest are cast his way; the things that stimulate him grow steadily in number, as do the kinds of things that please and displease him – the higher human being always becomes at the same time happier and unhappier. But a &lt;em&gt;delusion&lt;/em&gt; remains his constant companion: he thinks himself placed as &lt;em&gt;spectator&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;listener&lt;/em&gt; before the great visual and acoustic play that is life; he calls his nature &lt;em&gt;contemplative&lt;/em&gt; and thereby overlooks the fact that he is also the actual poet and ongoing author of life – that, to be sure, he differs greatly from the &lt;em&gt;actor&lt;/em&gt; of this drama, the so-called man of action, but even more so from a mere spectator and festival visitor &lt;em&gt;in front of&lt;/em&gt; the stage. As the poet, he certainly possesses &lt;em&gt;vis contemplativa&lt;/em&gt;10 and a retrospective view of his work; but at the same time and above all &lt;em&gt;vis creativa,11&lt;/em&gt; which the man of action lacks, whatever appearances and universal belief may say. It is we, the thinking-sensing ones, who really and continually &lt;em&gt;make&lt;/em&gt; something that is not yet there: the whole perpetually growing world of valuations, colours, weights, perspectives, scales, affirmations, and negations. This poem that we have invented is constantly internalized, drilled, translated into flesh and reality, indeed, into the commonplace, by the so-called practical human beings (our actors). Whatever has &lt;em&gt;value&lt;/em&gt; in the present world has it not in itself, according to its nature – nature is always value-less – but has rather been given, granted value, and &lt;em&gt;we&lt;/em&gt; were the givers and granters! Only we have created the world &lt;em&gt;that concerns human beings!&lt;/em&gt; But precisely this knowledge we lack, and when we catch it for a moment we have forgotten it the next: we misjudge our best power and underestimate ourselves just a bit, we contemplative ones. We are &lt;em&gt;neither as proud nor as happy&lt;/em&gt; as we could be.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The danger of the happiest.&lt;/em&gt; – To have refined senses and a refined taste; to be accustomed to the exquisite and most excellent things of the spirit as one is to the proper and most usual food; to enjoy a strong, bold, audacious soul; to go through life with a calm eye and a firm step, always prepared for the most extreme situations – as for a feast and full of yearning for undiscovered worlds and seas, people, and gods; to hearken to all cheerful music as if brave men, soldiers, seafarers were perhaps seeking a short rest and merriment there – and in the deepest pleasure of the moment to be overcome by tears and the whole crimson melancholy of the happy: who would not like all of this to be &lt;em&gt;his&lt;/em&gt; possession, his state! It was the &lt;em&gt;happiness of Homer!&lt;/em&gt; The happiness of the one who invented their gods for the Greeks – I mean, &lt;em&gt;his&lt;/em&gt; gods for himself! But don’t disregard the fact that with this Homeric happiness in one’s soul one is also more capable of suffering than any other creature under the sun! Only at this price can one buy the most precious shell hitherto washed ashore by the waves of existence! As its owner, one becomes ever more refined in pain and eventually too refined; in the end, any slight discontentment and disgust was enough to spoil life for Homer. He had been unable to solve a silly little riddle posed to him by some young fishermen!12 Yes, the little riddles are the danger for those who are happiest!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Two happy ones.&lt;/em&gt; – Truly, despite his youth, this person knows how to &lt;em&gt;improvise life&lt;/em&gt; and amazes even the keenest observer – for he never seems to make a mistake even though he constantly plays the riskiest game. It reminds one of those masters of musical improvisation to whose hands the listener would also like to ascribe a divine &lt;em&gt;infallibility&lt;/em&gt; even though, like every mortal, they make a mistake here and there. But they are practised and inventive and always ready at any moment to incorporate into the thematic order the most accidental note to which the stroke of a finger or a mood drives them, breathing a beautiful meaning and a soul into an accident. Here is an entirely different person: basically everything he wills and plans goes wrong. What occasionally he set his heart on several times brought him to the edge of the abyss and within a hair of destruction; and if he did escape that, it was certainly not just ‘with a black eye.’ Do you believe he is unhappy about this? He decided long ago not to take his own wishes and plans so seriously. ‘If I don’t succeed at this,’ he says to himself, ‘I might succeed at that; and on the whole I don’t know whether I should be more grateful towards my failures than towards any success. Was I made to be stubborn and to have a bull’s horns? That which constitutes the value and outcome of life &lt;em&gt;for me&lt;/em&gt; lies elsewhere; my pride as well as my misery lie elsewhere. I know more about life because I have so often been on the verge of losing it; and precisely therefore do I &lt;em&gt;get&lt;/em&gt; more out of life than any of you!’&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By doing we forgo.&lt;/em&gt; – Basically I abhor every morality that says: ‘Do not do this! Renounce! Overcome yourself!’ But I am well disposed towards those moralities that impel me to do something again and again from morning till evening, and to dream of it at night, and to think of nothing else than doing this &lt;em&gt;well,&lt;/em&gt; as well as &lt;em&gt;I&lt;/em&gt; alone can! When one lives that way, one thing after another that does not belong to such a life drops off: without hate or reluctance one sees this take its leave today and that tomorrow, like the yellow leaves that every faint wisp of wind carries off a tree. Or he does not notice that it takes its leave – so sternly is his eye set on its goal, entirely forwards, not sideways, backwards, downwards. ‘What we do should determine what we forgo; in doing we forgo’ – that’s how I like it; that is &lt;em&gt;my placitum.13&lt;/em&gt; But I do not want to strive for my impoverishment with open eyes; I do not like negative virtues – virtues whose very essence is negation and self-denial.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Self-control.&lt;/em&gt; – Those moralists who command man first and above all to gain control of himself thereby afflict him with a peculiar disease, namely, a constant irritability at all natural stirrings and inclinations and as it were a kind of itch. Whatever may henceforth push, pull, beckon, impel him from within or without will always strike this irritable one as endangering his self-control: no longer may he entrust himself to any instinct or free wing-beat; instead he stands there rigidly with a defensive posture, armed against himself, with sharp and suspicious eyes, the eternal guardian of his fortress, since he has turned himself into a fortress. Indeed, he can become &lt;em&gt;great&lt;/em&gt; this way! But how insufferable he has become to others; how impoverished and cut off from the most beautiful fortuities of the soul! And indeed from all further &lt;em&gt;instruction!&lt;/em&gt; For one must be able at times to lose oneself if one wants to learn something from things that we ourselves are not.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Stoics and Epicureans.&lt;/em&gt; – The Epicurean seeks out the situation, the persons, and even the events that suit his extremely sensitive intellectual constitution; he forgoes the rest – that is, almost everything – because it would be too strong and heavy a diet. The Stoic, by contrast, trains himself to swallow stones and worms, glass shards and scorpions without nausea; he wants his stomach to be ultimately insensible to everything the chance of existence pours into him – he brings to mind the Arabian sect of the Assua that one encounters in Algiers:14 like these insensitive people, he likes to act out his insensitivity before an invited audience, which is precisely what the Epicurean gladly eschews – for he has his ‘garden’!15 Stoicism may well be advisable for those with whom fate improvises and who live in violent times and depend on impulsive and changeable people. But someone who more or less &lt;em&gt;expects&lt;/em&gt; fate to allow him to spin &lt;em&gt;a long thread&lt;/em&gt; does well to take an Epicurean orientation; people engaged in work of the spirit have always done so! For it would be the loss of all losses, for them, to forfeit their subtle sensitivity in exchange for a hard Stoic skin with porcupine spines.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;In favour of criticism.&lt;/em&gt; – Something you formerly loved as a truth or a probability now strikes you as an error; you cast it off and believe your reason has made a victory. But maybe that error was as necessary for you then, when you were still another person – you are always another person – as are all your present ‘truths’, like a skin that concealed and covered many things you weren’t allowed to see yet. It is your new life, not your reason, that has killed that opinion for you: &lt;em&gt;you don’t need it any more,&lt;/em&gt; and now it collapses and unreason crawls out of it into the light like a worm. When we criticize, we are not doing something arbitrary and impersonal; it is, at least very often, proof that there are living, active forces within us shedding skin. We negate and have to negate because something in us &lt;em&gt;wants&lt;/em&gt; to live and affirm itself, something we might not yet know or see! – This in favour of criticism.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The history of every day.&lt;/em&gt; – What is the history of your every day? Consider the habits of which it consists: are they the product of innumerable little cowardices and lazinesses or of your courage and innovative reason? Different as the two cases may be, people could conceivably give you equal praise and you might actually benefit them equally either way. However, praise and benefit and respectability may be enough for those who want merely a good conscience – but not for you who scrupulously examine the inside of things and &lt;em&gt;know about conscience!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;From the seventh solitude.&lt;/em&gt; – One day the wanderer slammed a door shut behind him, came to a halt, and wept. Then he said: ‘This penchant and passion for what is true, real, non-apparent, certain – how it exasperates me! Why does this gloomy and earnest oppressor follow &lt;em&gt;me&lt;/em&gt; of all people! I want to rest, but he won’t allow it. How many things seduce me to linger? Everywhere there are Armida’s gardens16 for me. Thus ever again I must tear myself away and feel another new bitterness in my heart! Once again I must lift my foot, this tired, wounded foot; and having to do so often makes me cast a wrathful glance back at the most beautiful thing that could not hold me – &lt;em&gt;because&lt;/em&gt; it could not hold me!’&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I have already given my answer to the problem. The prerequisite to it is the assumption that the type of the Saviour has reached us only in a greatly distorted form. This distortion is very probable: there are many reasons why a type of that sort should not be handed down in a pure form, complete and free of additions. The milieu in which this strange figure moved must have left marks upon him, and more must have been imprinted by the history, the &lt;em&gt;destiny&lt;/em&gt;, of the early Christian communities; the latter indeed, must have embellished the type retrospectively with characters which can be understood only as serving the purposes of war and of propaganda. That strange and sickly world into which the Gospels lead us—a world apparently out of a Russian novel, in which the scum of society, nervous maladies and “childish” idiocy keep a tryst—must, in any case, have &lt;em&gt;coarsened&lt;/em&gt; the type: the first disciples, in particular, must have been forced to translate an existence visible only in symbols and incomprehensibilities into their own crudity, in order to understand it at all—in their sight the type could take on reality only after it had been recast in a familiar mould&amp;hellip;. The prophet, the messiah, the future judge, the teacher of morals, the worker of wonders, John the Baptist—all these merely presented chances to misunderstand it&amp;hellip;. Finally, let us not underrate the &lt;em&gt;proprium&lt;/em&gt; of all great, and especially all sectarian veneration: it tends to erase from the venerated objects all its original traits and idiosyncrasies, often so painfully strange—&lt;em&gt;it does not even see them&lt;/em&gt;. It is greatly to be regretted that no Dostoyevsky lived in the neighbourhood of this most interesting &lt;em&gt;décadent&lt;/em&gt;—I mean some one who would have felt the poignant charm of such a compound of the sublime, the morbid and the childish. In the last analysis, the type, as a type of the &lt;em&gt;décadence&lt;/em&gt;, may actually have been peculiarly complex and contradictory: such a possibility is not to be lost sight of. Nevertheless, the probabilities seem to be against it, for in that case tradition would have been particularly accurate and objective, whereas we have reasons for assuming the contrary. Meanwhile, there is a contradiction between the peaceful preacher of the mount, the sea-shore and the fields, who appears like a new Buddha on a soil very unlike India’s, and the aggressive fanatic, the mortal enemy of theologians and ecclesiastics, who stands glorified by Renan’s malice as “&lt;em&gt;le grand maître en ironie&lt;/em&gt;.” I myself haven’t any doubt that the greater part of this venom (and no less of &lt;em&gt;esprit&lt;/em&gt;) got itself into the concept of the Master only as a result of the excited nature of Christian propaganda: we all know the unscrupulousness of sectarians when they set out to turn their leader into an &lt;em&gt;apologia&lt;/em&gt; for themselves. When the early Christians had need of an adroit, contentious, pugnacious and maliciously subtle theologian to tackle other theologians, they &lt;em&gt;created&lt;/em&gt; a “god” that met that need, just as they put into his mouth without hesitation certain ideas that were necessary to them but that were utterly at odds with the Gospels—“the second coming,” “the last judgment,” all sorts of expectations and promises, current at the time.—&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Trade and nobility.&lt;/em&gt; – Buying and selling are common by now, like the art of reading and writing; everyone has practised it, even if he is not a tradesman, and gets more practice at this technique every day – just as formerly, in the age of a more savage humanity, everyone was a hunter and practised the technique of hunting every day. In that age, hunting was common; but eventually it became a privilege and thereby lost its everyday and common character – because it stopped being necessary and became a thing of moods and luxury. The same thing could happen to buying and selling one day. One can imagine social conditions in which there is no buying and selling and in which this technique gradually becomes unnecessary. Perhaps some individuals who are not as subject to the laws of the general condition will then give themselves permission to buy and sell as a &lt;em&gt;luxury of sentiment.&lt;/em&gt; Only then would trade become something exquisite, and the noble might enjoy trade as much as they hitherto enjoyed war and politics, while conversely the assessment of politics could have changed completely. Even now it is ceasing to be the art of the nobleman, and it is quite possible that some day one will find it so base that, along with all political literature and journalism, one classifies it as a ‘prostitution of the spirit’.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Will and wave.&lt;/em&gt; – How greedily this wave is approaching, as if it were trying to reach something! How it crawls with terrifying haste into the inmost crevices of the craggy gorge! It seems to be trying to arrive before someone else; something of value, of great value, seems to be hidden there. – And now it is returning, a bit more slowly but still quite white with excitement – is it disappointed? Has it found what it was seeking? Is it simulating disappointment? – But already another wave is nearing, still more greedily and wildly than the first; and its soul, too, seems full of secrets and the hunger for treasure-digging. That is how the waves live – that is how we live, we who will – I will say no more. So? You distrust me? You are angry with me, you beautiful monsters? Are you afraid I will divulge your entire secret? Well, be angry with me; raise your dangerous green bodies as high as you can; make a wall between me and the sun – as you are now! Truly, at this moment nothing remains of the world but green dusk and green thunderbolts. Carry on as you want, you high-spirited ones: roar with delight and malice – or dive again, pour your emeralds into the deepest depths, cast your endless white mane of foam and froth over them: everything is fine with me because everything suits you so well, and I love you so for everything – how could I betray &lt;em&gt;you!&lt;/em&gt; For – mark my words! – I know you and your secret; I know your kind! After all, you and I are of one kind! After all, you and I have one secret!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Refracted light.&lt;/em&gt; – One is not always brave; and when one gets tired, one of us, too, is likely one day to lament: ‘It is so hard to hurt people – why is it necessary! What good does it do us to live in seclusion when we don’t want to keep to ourselves what gives offence? Wouldn’t it be more advisable to live in the bustle and to do good to individuals as compensation for the sins that should and must be committed against everyone? To be foolish with fools, vain with the vain, fanatic with the fanatic? Wouldn’t it be fair, given the extravagant degree of deviation on the whole? When I hear of other people’s malice towards me, is not satisfaction the first thing I feel? Quite right! (I seem to be saying to them) I am so little in agreement with you and have so much truth on my side that you might as well have a good day at my expense whenever you can! Here are my faults and mistakes; here is my delusion, my bad taste, my confusion, my tears, my vanity, my owlish seclusion, my contradictions! Here’s something for you to laugh at! So then laugh and be merry! I am not angry with the law and nature of things that want faults and mistakes to cause merriment! To be sure, there have been “more beautiful” times when one could still, with every moderately new idea, feel so &lt;em&gt;indispensable&lt;/em&gt; as to take it out on the street and shout at everyone: “Behold! The kingdom of heaven is at hand!”17 I would not miss myself if I were gone. We are all dispensable!’ But as I said, this is not how we think when we are brave; then we don’t think &lt;em&gt;about that.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Prophetic human beings.&lt;/em&gt; – You are not sensible to the fact that prophetic human beings are full of suffering; you simply think they have been granted a beautiful ‘gift’ that you yourselves probably would like to have – but I will express myself in a parable. How animals can suffer from electricity in the air and clouds! We see how certain species, for example, monkeys, have a prophetic insight about the weather (as one can observe even in Europe – and not only in zoos, but also on Gibraltar). But we don’t think of the fact that for them, their &lt;em&gt;pains&lt;/em&gt; are prophets for them! When under the influence of an approaching, as yet far from visible cloud a strong positive electrical charge suddenly turns into negative electricity and a change in the weather is impending, these animals act as if an enemy were approaching and prepare for defence or escape. Most often they crawl into hiding – they don’t see bad weather as weather, but as an enemy whose hand they can already &lt;em&gt;feel&lt;/em&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Retrospection.&lt;/em&gt; – While we are living each phase of our lives we rarely recognize its true pathos, but always see it as the only state that is now possible for us and reasonable and – to use some words and a distinction of the Greeks – thoroughly an &lt;em&gt;ethos&lt;/em&gt; and not a &lt;em&gt;pathos.18&lt;/em&gt; Today a few notes of music called back to my memory a winter and a house and a most solitary life, as well as the feeling I lived with: I thought I could continue to live that way forever. But now I understand that it was pathos and passion throughout, comparable to this painful, courageous music which brings certain solace – one is not allowed to possess such things for years at a time, how much the less for eternities: they would make one too ‘overworldly’ for this planet.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Wisdom in pain.&lt;/em&gt; – There is as much wisdom in pain as in pleasure: like pleasure, pain is one of the prime species-preserving forces. If it weren’t, it would have perished long ago: that it hurts is no argument against it – it is its essence. In pain I hear the captain’s command: ‘Pull in the sails!’ The hardy seafarer ‘Man’ must have learned to adjust the sails in a thousand ways; otherwise he would have gone under too quickly and the ocean would have swallowed him too soon. We have to know how to live with reduced energy, too: as soon as pain sounds its safety signal, it is time for such a reduction – some great danger, some storm is approaching, and we do well to ‘inflate ourselves’ as little as possible. True, there are people who hear exactly the opposite command when great pain approaches and who never look as proud, bellicose, and happy as when a storm is nearing – yes, pain itself gives them their greatest moments! They are the heroic human beings, the great &lt;em&gt;pain-bringers&lt;/em&gt; of humanity, those few or rare ones who need the same apology as pain itself – and truly, they should not be denied this! They are eminently species-preserving and species-enhancing forces, if only because they resist comfort and do not hide their nausea at this type of happiness.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;As interpreters of our experiences.&lt;/em&gt; – One type of honesty has been alien to all religion-founders and such: they have not made their experiences a matter of conscience for their knowledge. ‘What did I really experience? What was going on inside and around me? Was my reason bright enough? Was my will turned against all deceptions of the senses and stalwart in warding off the fantastic?’ None of them has asked such questions. Even today, none of our dear religious ones asks them; rather, they have a thirst for things that are &lt;em&gt;contrary to reason&lt;/em&gt; and do not want to make it too hard for themselves to quench it – so they experience ‘miracles’ and ‘rebirths’ and hear the voices of the angels! But we, we others, we reason-thirsty ones, want to face our experiences as sternly as we would a scientific experiment, hour by hour, day by day! We want to be our own experiments and guinea-pigs.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I can only repeat that I set myself against all efforts to intrude the fanatic into the figure of the Saviour: the very word &lt;em&gt;impérieux&lt;/em&gt;, used by Renan, is alone enough to &lt;em&gt;annul&lt;/em&gt; the type. What the “glad tidings” tell us is simply that there are no more contradictions; the kingdom of heaven belongs to &lt;em&gt;children&lt;/em&gt;; the faith that is voiced here is no more an embattled faith—it is at hand, it has been from the beginning, it is a sort of recrudescent childishness of the spirit. The physiologists, at all events, are familiar with such a delayed and incomplete puberty in the living organism, the result of degeneration. A faith of this sort is not furious, it does not denounce, it does not defend itself: it does not come with “the sword”—it does not realize how it will one day set man against man. It does not manifest itself either by miracles, or by rewards and promises, or by “scriptures”: it is itself, first and last, its own miracle, its own reward, its own promise, its own “kingdom of God.” This faith does not formulate itself—it simply &lt;em&gt;lives&lt;/em&gt;, and so guards itself against formulae. To be sure, the accident of environment, of educational background gives prominence to concepts of a certain sort: in primitive Christianity one finds &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; concepts of a Judaeo-Semitic character (—that of eating and drinking at the last supper belongs to this category—an idea which, like everything else Jewish, has been badly mauled by the church). But let us be careful not to see in all this anything more than symbolical language, semantics[6] an opportunity to speak in parables. It is only on the theory that no work is to be taken literally that this anti-realist is able to speak at all. Set down among Hindus he would have made use of the concepts of Sankhya,[7] and among Chinese he would have employed those of Lao-tse[8]—and in neither case would it have made any difference to him.—With a little freedom in the use of words, one might actually call Jesus a “free spirit”[9]—he cares nothing for what is established: the word &lt;em&gt;killeth&lt;/em&gt;,[10] whatever is established &lt;em&gt;killeth&lt;/em&gt;. The idea of “life” as an &lt;em&gt;experience&lt;/em&gt;, as he alone conceives it, stands opposed to his mind to every sort of word, formula, law, belief and dogma. He speaks only of inner things: “life” or “truth” or “light” is his word for the innermost—in his sight everything else, the whole of reality, all nature, even language, has significance only as sign, as allegory.—Here it is of paramount importance to be led into no error by the temptations lying in Christian, or rather &lt;em&gt;ecclesiastical&lt;/em&gt; prejudices: such a symbolism &lt;em&gt;par excellence&lt;/em&gt; stands outside all religion, all notions of worship, all history, all natural science, all worldly experience, all knowledge, all politics, all psychology, all books, all art—his “wisdom” is precisely a &lt;em&gt;pure ignorance&lt;/em&gt;[11] of all such things. He has never heard of &lt;em&gt;culture&lt;/em&gt;; he doesn’t have to make war on it—he doesn’t even deny it&amp;hellip;. The same thing may be said of the &lt;em&gt;state&lt;/em&gt;, of the whole bourgeoise social order, of labour, of war—he has no ground for denying “the world,” for he knows nothing of the ecclesiastical concept of “the world”&amp;hellip;. &lt;em&gt;Denial&lt;/em&gt; is precisely the thing that is impossible to him.—In the same way he lacks argumentative capacity, and has no belief that an article of faith, a “truth,” may be established by proofs (—&lt;em&gt;his&lt;/em&gt; proofs are inner “lights,” subjective sensations of happiness and self-approval, simple “proofs of power”—). Such a doctrine &lt;em&gt;cannot&lt;/em&gt; contradict: it doesn’t know that other doctrines exist, or &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; exist, and is wholly incapable of imagining anything opposed to it&amp;hellip;. If anything of the sort is ever encountered, it laments the “blindness” with sincere sympathy—for it alone has “light”—but it does not offer objections&amp;hellip;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Undesired disciples.&lt;/em&gt; – ‘What can I do with these two young men!’ cried an irritated philosopher who ‘corrupted’ the youth as Socrates once had done;19 they are unwelcome students. This one can’t say ‘no’ and the other one says ‘half and half’ about everything. If they adopted my doctrine, the first would &lt;em&gt;suffer&lt;/em&gt; too much, for my way of thinking requires a warlike soul, a desire to hurt, a delight in saying no, a hard skin; he would languish from open and internal wounds. And the other would strike a compromise with everything he represents and thereby make it into a mediocrity – such a disciple I wish on my enemies.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Where can &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt; lie down in the sun so that an abundance of well-being comes to you, too, and your existence justifies itself? Let everyone do that for himself – you seem to me to be saying – and let everyone put out of his mind generalities and worries about others and about society!

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;New caution.&lt;/em&gt; – Let’s stop thinking so much about punishing, reproaching, and improving! We rarely change an individual; and should we succeed, something else may have been accomplished, unnoticed: &lt;em&gt;we&lt;/em&gt; may have been changed through him! Let’s rather make sure our own influence &lt;em&gt;on all that is to come&lt;/em&gt; balances and outweighs his influence! Let’s not struggle in a direct fight, which is what reproaching, punishing, and desiring to improve amount to. Let’s rather raise ourselves that much higher. Let us give our own example ever more brilliant colours! Let us darken the others through our light! No – let’s not become &lt;em&gt;darker&lt;/em&gt; on their account, like those who punish and are dissatisfied! Let’s sooner step aside! Let us look away!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;In media vita.19&lt;/em&gt; – No, life has not disappointed me. Rather, I find it truer, more desirable and mysterious every year – ever since the day the great liberator overcame me: the thought that life could be an experiment for the knowledge-seeker – not a duty, not a disaster, not a deception! And knowledge itself: let it be something else to others, like a bed to rest on or the way to one, or a diversion or a form of idleness; to me it is a world of dangers and victories in which heroic feelings also have their dance- and playgrounds. ‘&lt;em&gt;Life as a means to knowledge&lt;/em&gt; – with this principle in one’s heart one can not only live bravely but also &lt;em&gt;live gaily and laugh gaily!&lt;/em&gt; And who would know how to laugh and live well who did not first have a good understanding of war and victory?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;What belongs to greatness&lt;/em&gt; – Who will attain something great if he does not feel in himself the power to &lt;em&gt;inflict&lt;/em&gt; great pain? Being able to suffer is the least; weak women and even slaves often achieve mastery at that. But not to perish of inner distress and uncertainty when one inflicts great suffering and hears the cry of this suffering – that is great; that belongs to greatness.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Soul-doctors and pain.&lt;/em&gt; – All preachers of morals, and all theologians, share one bad habit: they all try to talk people into thinking they are in a very bad way and need some severe, final, radical cure. And since humanity has for centuries far too eagerly lent its ear to these doctrines, something of this superstition of being very badly off has finally stuck, so that they are now only too ready to sigh and find nothing good in life and make sad faces together, as if life were really quite hard to &lt;em&gt;endure.&lt;/em&gt; In reality, they are uninhibitedly sure of and in love with their lives, and are full of innumerable wiles and tricks to get rid of unpleasantness and extract the thorn of pain and misfortune. Talk of pain and misfortune always strikes me as &lt;em&gt;exaggerated,&lt;/em&gt; as if it were a matter of good manners to exaggerate here while deliberately keeping quiet about the fact that there are innumerable palliatives against pain, such as an aesthetics, or the feverish haste of thoughts, or a restful position of the body, or good and bad memories, intentions, hopes, and many types of pride and sympathy, which have nearly the same effect as anaesthesia – and at the highest degrees of pain, unconsciousness automatically takes over. We know quite well how to trickle sweets onto our bitternesses, especially onto the soul’s bitternesses; we find aid in our boldness and sublimity, as well as in the nobler deliriums of submission and resignation. A loss is a loss for barely an hour; somehow it also brings us a gift from heaven – new strength, for example, or at least a new opportunity for strength! What fantasies about the inner ‘miseries’ of evil persons the preachers of morals have concocted! How they have even &lt;em&gt;lied&lt;/em&gt; to us about the unhappiness of passionate people! Yes, ‘lied’ is here the proper term: they knew very well about the superabundant happiness of this type of person, but kept a deathly silence about it, since it constituted a refutation of their theory on which happiness arises only with the annihilation of passion and the silencing of the will! Finally, concerning these soul-doctors’ prescription and their praise for a severe, radical cure, one may ask: is our life really so painful and burdensome that it would be advantageous for us to trade it for a fossilized Stoic way of life? Things are &lt;em&gt;not bad enough&lt;/em&gt; for us that they have to be bad for us in the Stoic style!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Taking seriously.&lt;/em&gt; – For most people, the intellect is an awkward, gloomy, creaking machine that is hard to start: when they want to work with this machine and think well, they call it ‘taking the matter &lt;em&gt;seriously’&lt;/em&gt; – oh, how taxing good thinking must be for them! The lovely human beast seems to lose its good mood when it thinks well; it becomes ‘serious’! And ‘where laughter and gaiety are found, thinking is good for nothing’ – that is the prejudice of this serious beast against all ‘gay science’. Well then, let us prove it a prejudice!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;To harm stupidity.&lt;/em&gt; – Surely the creed concerning the reprehensibility of egoism, preached so stubbornly and with so much conviction, has on the whole harmed egoism (to the advantage of, as I will repeat a hundred times, the herd instincts!) – above all, by depriving egoism of its good conscience and telling us to seek in it the true source of all unhappiness. ‘Your selfishness is the reason your life is miserable (&lt;em&gt;Unheil&lt;/em&gt;)’ – that was preached for millennia and, as I said, harmed selfishness and deprived it of much spirit, much cheerfulness, much inventiveness, much beauty; it made selfishness stupid and ugly and poisoned it! Ancient philosophy, by contrast, taught a quite different main source of misery (&lt;em&gt;Unheil&lt;/em&gt;): from Socrates onwards these thinkers never tired of preaching, ‘Your thoughtlessness and stupidity, your way of living according to the rule, your subordination to the opinion of your neighbour is the reason why you so seldom achieve happiness we thinkers are, as thinkers, the happiest.’ Let us not decide here whether this sermon against stupidity had better reasons on its side than the sermon against selfishness; what is certain, however, is that it deprived stupidity of its good conscience – these philosophers &lt;em&gt;harmed&lt;/em&gt; stupidity.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Leisure and idleness.&lt;/em&gt; – There is something of the American Indian, something of the savagery peculiar to the Indian blood, in the way the Americans strive for gold; and their breathless haste in working – the true vice of the new world – is already starting to spread to old Europe, making it savage and covering it with a most odd mindlessness. Already one is ashamed of keeping still; long reflection almost gives people a bad conscience. One thinks with a watch in hand, as one eats lunch with an eye on the financial pages – one lives like someone who might always ‘miss out on something’. ‘Rather do anything than nothing’ – even this principle is a cord to strangle all culture and all higher taste. Just as all forms are visibly being destroyed by the haste of the workers, so, too, is the feeling for form itself, the ear and eye for the melody of movements. The proof of this lies in the &lt;em&gt;crude obviousness&lt;/em&gt; which is universally demanded in all situations in which people want for once to be honest with others – in their relations with friends, women, relatives, children, teachers, students, leaders, and princes: one no longer has time and energy for ceremony, for civility with detours, for &lt;em&gt;esprit&lt;/em&gt; in conversation, and in general for any otium.20 For life in a hunt for profit constantly forces people to expend their spirit to the point of exhaustion in continual pretence or out-smarting or forestalling others: the true virtue today is doing something in less time than someone else. And thus hours in which honesty is &lt;em&gt;allowed&lt;/em&gt; are rare; during them, however, one is tired and wants not only to ‘let oneself go’ but also to lay oneself down and &lt;em&gt;stretch oneself out&lt;/em&gt; unceremoniously to one’s full length and breadth. This is the way people now write &lt;em&gt;letters,&lt;/em&gt; the style and spirit of which will always be the true ‘sign of the times’. If sociability and the arts still offer any delight, it is the kind of delight that overworked slaves make for themselves. How frugal our educated and uneducated have become concerning ‘joy’! How they are becoming increasingly suspicious of all joy! More and more, &lt;em&gt;work&lt;/em&gt; gets all good conscience on its side; the desire for joy already calls itself a ‘need to recuperate’ and is starting to be ashamed of itself. ‘One owes it to one’s health’ – that is what one says when caught on an excursion in the countryside. Soon we may well reach the point where one can’t give in to the desire for a &lt;em&gt;vita contemplativa21&lt;/em&gt; (that is, taking a walk with ideas and friends) without self-contempt and a bad conscience. Well, formerly it was the other way around: work was afflicted with a bad conscience. A person of good family &lt;em&gt;concealed&lt;/em&gt; the fact that he worked if need compelled him to work. The slave worked under the pressure of the feeling that he was doing something contemptible: ‘doing’ was itself contemptible. ‘Nobility and honour are attached solely to &lt;em&gt;otium&lt;/em&gt; and bellum’22 – that was the ancient prejudice!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

It chimed quietly. A slender shadow appeared on the hall stair.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In the whole psychology of the “Gospels” the concepts of guilt and punishment are lacking, and so is that of reward. “Sin,” which means anything that puts a distance between God and man, is abolished—&lt;em&gt;this is precisely the “glad tidings.”&lt;/em&gt; Eternal bliss is not merely promised, nor is it bound up with conditions: it is conceived as the &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; reality—what remains consists merely of signs useful in speaking of it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Only now, quite late and after tremendous self-conquest, has he become a &lt;em&gt;distrustful&lt;/em&gt; animal. Yes, man is now more evil than ever.’ I do not understand this: why should man be more distrustful and evil now? ‘Because he now has a science – needs a science.’&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Applause.&lt;/em&gt; – A thinker needs no applause and clapping of hands provided he is sure of his own clapping of hands; he cannot do without that. Are there people who can dispense with that, too, and altogether with every kind of applause? I doubt it; and Tacitus, who did not slander the wise, said even of the wisest of men: &lt;em&gt;quando etiam sapientibus gloriae cupido novissima excuitur&lt;/em&gt;23 – which for him means never.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Better deaf than deafened&lt;/em&gt; – Formerly one wanted to be &lt;em&gt;talked&lt;/em&gt; about; that is no longer enough, since the market has grown too large – only a &lt;em&gt;shout&lt;/em&gt; will do. As a result, even good voices shout themselves down, and the best goods are offered by hoarse voices; without the vendors’ cry and hoarseness there is no longer any genius. That is, to be sure, a bad epoch for a thinker; he must learn how to find his own quietude even between two noises, and pretend he is deaf until he really is. As long as he has not learned this, he runs the risk of going to pieces from impatience and headaches.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;What knowing means. – Non ridere, non lugere, neque detestari, sed intelligere&lt;/em&gt;!24 says Spinoza as simply and sublimely as is his wont. Yet in the final analysis, what is this &lt;em&gt;intelligere&lt;/em&gt; other than the way we become sensible of the other three? A result of the different and conflicting impulses to laugh, lament, and curse? Before knowledge is possible, each of these impulses must first have presented its one-sided view of the thing or event; then comes the fight between these one-sided views, and occasionally out of it a mean, an appeasement, a concession to all three sides, a kind of justice and contract; for in virtue of justice and a contract all these impulses can assert and maintain themselves in existence and each can finally feel it is in the right vis-à-vis all the others. Since only the ultimate reconciliation scenes and final accounts of this long process rise to consciousness, we suppose that &lt;em&gt;intelligere&lt;/em&gt; must be something conciliatory, just, and good, something essentially opposed to the instincts, when in fact &lt;em&gt;it is only a certain behaviour of the drives towards one another.&lt;/em&gt; For the longest time, conscious thought was considered thought itself; only now does the truth dawn on us that by far the greatest part of our mind’s activity proceeds unconscious and unfelt; but I think these drives which here fight each other know very well how to make themselves felt by and how to hurt &lt;em&gt;each other.&lt;/em&gt; This may well be the source of that great and sudden exhaustion that afflicts all thinkers (it is the exhaustion of the battlefield). Indeed, there may be many hidden instances for &lt;em&gt;heroism&lt;/em&gt; in our warring depths, but certainly nothing divine, eternally resting in itself, as Spinoza supposed. &lt;em&gt;Conscious&lt;/em&gt; thought, especially that of the philosopher, is the least vigorous and therefore also the relatively mildest and calmest type of thought; and thus precisely philosophers are most easily led astray about the nature of knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;One must learn to love.&lt;/em&gt; – This happens to us in music: first one must &lt;em&gt;learn to hear&lt;/em&gt; a figure and melody at all, to detect and distinguish it, to isolate and delimit it as a life in itself; then one needs effort and good will to &lt;em&gt;stand&lt;/em&gt; it despite its strangeness; patience with its appearance and expression, and kindheartedness about its oddity. Finally comes a moment when we are &lt;em&gt;used&lt;/em&gt; to it; when we expect it; when we sense that we’d miss it if it were missing; and now it continues relentlessly to compel and enchant us until we have become its humble and enraptured lovers, who no longer want anything better from the world than it and it again. But this happens to us not only in music: it is in just this way that we have &lt;em&gt;learned to love&lt;/em&gt; everything we now love. We are always rewarded in the end for our good will, our patience, our fair-mindedness and gentleness with what is strange, as it gradually casts off its veil and presents itself as a new and indescribable beauty. That is &lt;em&gt;its thanks&lt;/em&gt; for our hospitality. Even he who loves himself will have learned it this way – there is no other way. Love, too, must be learned.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Long live physics!&lt;/em&gt; – So, how many people know how to observe? And of these few, how many to observe themselves? ‘Everyone is farthest from himself’25 – every person who is expert at scrutinizing the inner life of others knows this to his own chagrin; and the saying, ‘Know thyself’, addressed to human beings by a god, is near to malicious.26 &lt;em&gt;That&lt;/em&gt; self-observation is in such a bad state, however, is most clearly confirmed by the way in which &lt;em&gt;nearly everyone&lt;/em&gt; speaks of the nature of a moral act – that quick, willing, convinced, talkative manner, with its look, its smile, its obliging eagerness! People seem to be wanting to say to you, ‘But my dear fellow, that is precisely &lt;em&gt;my&lt;/em&gt; subject! You are directing your question to the person who is &lt;em&gt;competent&lt;/em&gt; to answer it: there is, as it happens, nothing I am wiser about. So: when man judges &lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;that is right&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt; and infers &lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;hence it must come about!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt; and then &lt;em&gt;does&lt;/em&gt; what he thus has recognized to be right and described as necessary – then the nature of his act is &lt;em&gt;moral&lt;/em&gt;!’ But, my friend, you are speaking of three acts instead of one: even the judgement ‘that is right’, for example, is an act. Wouldn’t it be possible for a person to make a judgement in a way that would be moral or immoral? &lt;em&gt;Why&lt;/em&gt; do you take this and specifically this to be right? ‘Because my conscience tells me so; conscience never speaks immorally, since it determines what is to count as moral!’ But why do you &lt;em&gt;listen&lt;/em&gt; to the words of your conscience? And what gives you the right to consider such a judgement true and infallible? For this belief – is there no conscience? Do you know nothing of an intellectual conscience? A conscience behind your ‘conscience’? Your judgement, ‘that is right’ has a prehistory in your drives, inclinations, aversions, experiences, and what you have failed to experience; you have to ask, &lt;em&gt;‘how&lt;/em&gt; did it emerge there?’ and then also, &lt;em&gt;‘what&lt;/em&gt; is really impelling me to listen to it?’ You can listen to its commands like a good soldier who heeds the command of his officer. Or like a woman who loves the one who commands. Or like a flatterer and coward who fears the commander. Or like a fool who obeys because he can think of no objection. In short, there are a hundred ways to listen to your conscience. But &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; you hear this or that judgement as the words of conscience, i.e. &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; you feel something to be right may have its cause in your never having thought much about yourself and in your blindly having accepted what has been labelled &lt;em&gt;right&lt;/em&gt; since your childhood; or in the fact that fulfilling your duties has so far brought you bread and honours – and you consider it right because it appears to you as &lt;em&gt;your own&lt;/em&gt; ‘condition of existence’ (and that you have a &lt;em&gt;right&lt;/em&gt; to existence seems irrefutable to you). For all that, the &lt;em&gt;firmness&lt;/em&gt; of your moral judgement could be evidence of your personal wretchedness, of lack of a personality; your ‘moral strength’ might have its source in your stubbornness – or in your inability to envisage new ideals. And, briefly, had you reflected more subtly, observed better, and studied more, you would never continue to call this ‘duty’ of yours and this ‘conscience’ of yours duty and conscience. Your insight into &lt;em&gt;how such things as moral judgements could ever have come into existence&lt;/em&gt; would spoil these emotional words for you, as other emotional words, for example, ‘sin’, ‘salvation of the soul’, and ‘redemption’ have been spoiled for you. And now don’t bring up the categorical imperative, my friend! The term tickles my ear and makes me laugh despite your very serious presence. I am reminded of old Kant, who helped himself to (&lt;em&gt;erschlichen&lt;/em&gt;) the ‘thing in itself’ – another very ridiculous thing! – and was punished for this when the ‘categorical imperative’ crept into (&lt;em&gt;beschlichen&lt;/em&gt;) his heart and made him stray back to ‘God’, ‘soul’, ‘freedom’, ‘immortality’, like a fox who strays back into his cage. Yet it had been &lt;em&gt;his&lt;/em&gt; strength and cleverness that had &lt;em&gt;broken open&lt;/em&gt; the cage!27 What? You admire the categorical imperative within you? This ‘firmness’ of your so-called moral judgement? This absoluteness of the feeling, ‘here everyone must judge as I do’? Rather admire your &lt;em&gt;selfishness&lt;/em&gt; here! And the blindness, pettiness, and simplicity of your selfishness! For it is selfish to consider one’s own judgement a universal law, and this selfishness is blind, petty, and simple because it shows that you haven’t yet discovered yourself or created for yourself an ideal of your very own – for this could never be someone else’s, let alone everyone’s, everyone’s! No one who judges, ‘in this case everyone would have to act like this’ has yet taken five steps towards self-knowledge. For he would then know that there neither are nor can be actions that are all the same; that every act ever performed was done in an altogether unique and unrepeatable way, and that this will be equally true of every future act; that all prescriptions of action (even the most inward and subtle rules of all moralities so far) relate only to their rough exterior; that these prescriptions may yield an appearance of sameness, &lt;em&gt;but only just an appearance;&lt;/em&gt; that as one observes or recollects &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; action, it is and remains impenetrable; that our opinions about ‘good’ and ‘noble’ and ‘great’ can never be &lt;em&gt;proven true&lt;/em&gt; by our actions because every act is unknowable; that our opinions, valuations, and tables of what is good are certainly some of the most powerful levers in the machinery of our actions, but that in each case, the law of its mechanism is unprovable. Let us therefore &lt;em&gt;limit&lt;/em&gt; ourselves to the purification of our opinions and value judgements and to the &lt;em&gt;creation of tables of what is good that are new and all our own:&lt;/em&gt; let us stop brooding over the ‘moral value of our actions’! Yes, my friends, it is time to feel nauseous about some people’s moral chatter about others. Sitting in moral judgement should offend our taste. Let us leave such chatter and such bad taste to those who have nothing to do but drag the past a few steps further through time and who never live in the present – that is, to the many, the great majority! We, however, want to &lt;em&gt;become who we are&lt;/em&gt; – human beings who are new, unique, incomparable, who give themselves laws, who create themselves! To that end we must become the best students and discoverers of everything lawful and necessary in the world: we must become &lt;em&gt;physicists&lt;/em&gt; in order to be creators in this sense – while hitherto all valuations and ideals have been built on &lt;em&gt;ignorance&lt;/em&gt; of physics or in &lt;em&gt;contradiction&lt;/em&gt; to it. So, long live physics! And even more long live what &lt;em&gt;compels&lt;/em&gt; us to it – our honesty!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nature’s stinginess.&lt;/em&gt; – Why has nature been so miserly towards humans that it did not allow them to shine – one more brightly, the other less so, each according to his inner magnitude of light? Why are great human beings not as beautifully visible in their own rising and setting as the sun? How much more unambiguous this would make life among men!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The ‘humanity’ of the future.&lt;/em&gt; – When I view this age with the eyes of a distant age, I can find nothing odder in present-day man than his peculiar virtue and disease called ‘the sense for history’. This is the beginning of something completely new and strange in history: if one gave this seed a few centuries and more, it might ultimately become a wonderful growth with an equally wonderful smell that could make our old earth more agreeable to inhabit. We present-day humans are just beginning to form the chain of a very powerful future feeling, link by link – we hardly know what we are doing. It seems to us almost as if we are dealing not with a new feeling but with a decrease in all old feelings: the sense for history is still something so poor and cold, and many are struck by it as by a frost and made even poorer and colder by it. To others it appears as the sign of old age creeping up, and they see our planet as a melancholy sick man who chronicles his youth in order to forget his present condition. Indeed, that is one colour of this new feeling: he who is able to feel the history of man altogether as his own history feels in a monstrous generalization all the grief of the invalid thinking of health, of the old man thinking of the dreams of his youth, of the lover robbed of his beloved, of the martyr whose ideal is perishing, of the hero on the eve after a battle that decided nothing but brought him wounds and the loss of a friend. But to bear and to be able to bear this monstrous sum of all kinds of grief and still be the hero who, on the second day of battle, greets dawn and his fortune as a person whose horizon stretches millennia before and behind him, as the dutiful heir to all the nobility of past spirit, as the most aristocratic of old nobles and at the same time the first of a new nobility the likes of which no age has ever seen or dreamt: to take this upon one’s soul – the oldest, the newest, losses, hopes, conquests, victories of humanity. To finally take all this in one soul and compress it into one feeling – this would surely have to produce a happiness unknown to humanity so far: a divine happiness full of power and love, full of tears and laughter, a happiness which, like the sun in the evening, continually draws on its inexhaustible riches, giving them away and pouring them into the sea, a happiness which, like the evening sun, feels richest when even the poorest fisherman is rowing with a golden oar! This divine feeling would then be called – humanity!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The will to suffer and those who feel compassion.&lt;/em&gt; – Is it good for you yourselves to be above all else compassionate persons? And is it good for those who suffer if you are compassionate? But let us leave the first question unanswered for a moment. What we most deeply and most personally suffer from is incomprehensible and inaccessible to nearly everyone else; here we are hidden from our nearest, even if we eat from the same pot. But whenever we are &lt;em&gt;noticed&lt;/em&gt; to be suffering, our suffering is superficially construed; it is the essence of the feeling of compassion that it &lt;em&gt;strips&lt;/em&gt; the suffering of what is truly personal: our ‘benefactors’ diminish our worth and our will more than our enemies do. In most cases of beneficence toward those in distress there is something offensive in the intellectual frivolity with which the one who feels compassion plays the role of fate: he knows nothing of the whole inner sequence and interconnection that spells misfortune for &lt;em&gt;me&lt;/em&gt; or for you! The entire economy of my soul and the balance effected by ‘misfortune’, the breaking open of new springs and needs, the healing of old wounds, the shedding of entire periods of the past – all such things that can be involved in misfortune do not concern the dear compassionate one: they want to &lt;em&gt;help&lt;/em&gt; and have no thought that there is a personal necessity of misfortune; that terrors, deprivations, impoverishments, midnights, adventures, risks, and blunders are as necessary for me and you as their opposites; indeed, to express myself mystically, that the path to one’s own heaven always leads through the voluptuousness of one’s own hell. No, they know nothing of that: the ‘religion of compassion’ (or ‘the heart’) commands them to help, and they believe they have helped best when they have helped most quickly! Should you adherents to this religion really have the same attitude towards yourselves that you have towards your fellow men; should you refuse to let your suffering lie on you even for an hour and instead constantly prevent all possible misfortune ahead of time; should you experience suffering and displeasure as evil, hateful, deserving of annihilation, as a defect of existence, then you have besides your religion of pity also another religion in your hearts; and the latter is perhaps the mother of the former – &lt;em&gt;the religion of snug cosiness.&lt;/em&gt; Oh, how little do you know of the &lt;em&gt;happiness&lt;/em&gt; of man, you comfortable and good-natured ones! For happiness and misfortune (&lt;em&gt;Glück und Unglück&lt;/em&gt;) are two siblings and twins who either grow up together or – as with you – &lt;em&gt;remain small&lt;/em&gt; together! But now back to the first question. How is it possible to keep to &lt;em&gt;one’s own&lt;/em&gt; path! Some clamour is constantly calling us aside; rarely does our eye see something there that does not make it necessary to drop our own occupation instantly and spring to assistance. I know, there are a hundred decent and praiseworthy ways of losing myself&lt;em&gt;from my path,&lt;/em&gt; and, verily, highly ‘moral’ ways! Yes, the moral teacher of compassion even goes so far as to hold that precisely this and only this is moral – to lose &lt;em&gt;one’s own&lt;/em&gt; way like this in order to help a neighbour. I, too, know with certainty that I need only to expose myself to the sight of real distress and I, too, &lt;em&gt;am&lt;/em&gt; lost! If a suffering friend said to me, ‘Look, I am about to die; please promise to die with me’, I would promise it; likewise, the sight of a small mountain tribe fighting for its freedom would make me offer my hand and my life – for once to choose bad examples, for good reasons. Yes, there is a secret seduction even in all these things which arouse compassion and cry out for help, for our own way is so hard and demanding and so far from love and gratitude of others that we are by no means reluctant to escape from it, from it and our ownmost conscience – and take refuge in the conscience of the others and in the lovely temple of the ‘religion of compassion’. As soon as any war breaks out, precisely the noblest men in the population immediately begin to experience a delight which is, to be sure, kept secret: they throw themselves rapturously into the new danger of &lt;em&gt;death&lt;/em&gt; because it seems to offer them that long-desired permission – the permission &lt;em&gt;to deviate from their goal;&lt;/em&gt; war offers them a detour to suicide, but a detour with a good conscience. And, although I will keep quiet here about some things, I do not wish to keep quiet about my morality, which tells me: Live in seclusion so that you &lt;em&gt;are able&lt;/em&gt; to live for yourself! Live &lt;em&gt;in ignorance&lt;/em&gt; of what seems most important to your age! Lay at least the skin of three hundred years between you and today! And let the clamour of today, the noise of war and revolutions, be but a murmur to you. You will also want to help – but only those whose distress you properly &lt;em&gt;understand&lt;/em&gt; because they share with you one suffering and one hope – your &lt;em&gt;friends&lt;/em&gt; – and only in the way you help yourself: I want to make them braver, more persevering, simpler, more full of gaiety. I want to teach them what is today understood by so few, least of all by these preachers of compassion (&lt;em&gt;Mitleiden):&lt;/em&gt; to share not pain, but &lt;em&gt;joy (Mitfreude)!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Vita femina&lt;/em&gt;.28 – Not even all knowledge and all good will suffice for seeing the ultimate beauties of a work; it requires the rarest of lucky accidents for the clouds that veil the peaks to lift for us momentarily and for the sun to shine on them. Not only must we stand in just the right spot to see this, but our own soul, too, must itself have pulled the veil from its heights and must have been in need of some external expression and parable, as if it needed a hold in order to retain control of itself. But so rarely does all of this coincide that I am inclined to believe that the highest peaks of everything good, be it work, deed, humanity, or nature, have so far remained hidden and covered from the majority and even from the best. But what does unveil itself for us &lt;em&gt;unveils itself for us only once!&lt;/em&gt; The Greeks, to be sure, prayed: ‘Everything beautiful twice and thrice!’29 Indeed, they had good reason to summon the gods, for ungodly reality gives us the beautiful either never or only once! I mean to say that the world is brimming with beautiful things but nevertheless poor, very poor in beautiful moments and in the unveilings of those things. But perhaps that is the strongest magic of life: it is covered by a veil of beautiful possibilities, woven with threads of gold – promising, resisting, bashful, mocking, compassionate, and seductive. Yes, life is a woman!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;If I understand anything at all about this great symbolist, it is this: that he regarded only &lt;em&gt;subjective&lt;/em&gt; realities as realities, as “truths”—that he saw everything else, everything natural, temporal, spatial and historical, merely as signs, as materials for parables. The concept of “the Son of God” does not connote a concrete person in history, an isolated and definite individual, but an “eternal” fact, a psychological symbol set free from the concept of time. The same thing is true, and in the highest sense, of the &lt;em&gt;God&lt;/em&gt; of this typical symbolist, of the “kingdom of God,” and of the “sonship of God.” Nothing could be more un-Christian than the &lt;em&gt;crude ecclesiastical&lt;/em&gt; notions of God as a &lt;em&gt;person&lt;/em&gt;, of a “kingdom of God” that is to come, of a “kingdom of heaven” beyond, and of a “son of God” as the &lt;em&gt;second person&lt;/em&gt; of the Trinity. All this—if I may be forgiven the phrase—is like thrusting one’s fist into the eye (and what an eye!) of the Gospels: a disrespect for symbols amounting to &lt;em&gt;world-historical cynicism&lt;/em&gt;&amp;hellip;. But it is nevertheless obvious enough what is meant by the symbols “Father” and “Son”—not, of course, to every one—: the word “Son” expresses &lt;em&gt;entrance&lt;/em&gt; into the feeling that there is a general transformation of all things (beatitude), and “Father” expresses &lt;em&gt;that feeling itself&lt;/em&gt;—the sensation of eternity and of perfection.—I am ashamed to remind you of what the church has made of this symbolism: has it not set an Amphitryon story[13] at the threshold of the Christian “faith”? And a dogma of “immaculate conception” for good measure?&amp;hellip; &lt;em&gt;And thereby it has robbed conception of its immaculateness&lt;/em&gt;—&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;*Historia abscondita.*20 – Every great human being exerts a retroactive force: for his sake all of history is put on the scale again, and a thousand secrets of the past crawl out of their hiding places – into &lt;em&gt;his&lt;/em&gt; sunshine. There is no telling what may yet become a part of history. Maybe the past is still essentially undiscovered! So many retroactive forces are still needed!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;*The dying Socrates.*30 – I admire the courage and wisdom of Socrates in everything he did, said – and did not say. This mocking, love-sick monster and pied piper of Athens, who made the most audacious youths of Athens tremble and sob, was not only the wisest chatterer of all time; he was equally great in silence. I wish he had remained silent also in the last moments of his life – perhaps he would then belong to a still higher order of minds. Whether it was death or the poison or piety or malice – something loosened his tongue and he said: ‘O Crito, I owe Asclepius a rooster.’ This ridiculous and terrible ‘last word’ means for those who have ears: ‘O Crito, &lt;em&gt;life is a disease&lt;/em&gt;.’31 Is it possible that a man like him, who had lived cheerfully and like a soldier in plain view of everyone, was a pessimist? He had merely kept a cheerful demeanour while all his life hiding his ultimate judgement, his inmost feeling! Socrates, Socrates &lt;em&gt;suffered from life!&lt;/em&gt; And then he still avenged himself – with this veiled, gruesome, pious, and blasphemous saying. Did a Socrates really need &lt;em&gt;revenge?&lt;/em&gt; Was there one ounce too little magnanimity in his overabundant virtue? – O friends! We must overcome even the Greeks!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Incipit tragoedia.32&lt;/em&gt; – When Zarathustra33 was thirty years old, he left his homeland and Lake Urmi and went into the mountains. There he enjoyed his spirit and solitude, and did not tire of that for ten years. But at last his heart changed – and one morning he arose with rosy dawn, stepped before the sun, and spoke to it thus: ‘You great heavenly body! What would your happiness be if you did not have those for whom you shine! For ten years you have climbed up to my cave; without me, my eagle, and my snake, you would have become tired of your light and of this road; but we awaited you every morning, relieved you of your overabundance, and blessed you for it. Behold, I am sick of my wisdom, like a bee that has collected too much honey; I need outstretched hands; I would like to give away and distribute until the wise among humans once again enjoy their folly and the poor once again their riches. For that I must step into the depths, as you do in the evening when you go behind the sea and bring light even to the underworld, you over-rich heavenly body! Like you I must &lt;em&gt;go under,&lt;/em&gt; as it is called by the human beings to whom I want to descend. So bless me then, you calm eye that can look without envy upon all-too-great happiness! Bless the cup that wants to overflow in order that the water may flow golden from it and everywhere carry the reflection of your bliss! Behold, this cup wants to become empty again, and Zarathustra wants to become human again.’ Thus began Zarathustra’s going under.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;How to understand our cheerfulness.&lt;/em&gt; – The greatest recent event – that ‘God is dead’; that the belief in the Christian God has become unbelievable – is already starting to cast its first shadow over Europe. To those few at least whose eyes – or the &lt;em&gt;suspicion&lt;/em&gt; in whose eyes is strong and subtle enough for this spectacle, some kind of sun seems to have set; some old deep trust turned into doubt: to them, our world must appear more autumnal, more mistrustful, stranger, ‘older’. But in the main one might say: for many people’s power of comprehension, the event is itself far too great, distant, and out of the way even for its tidings to be thought of as having arrived yet. Even less may one suppose many to know at all &lt;em&gt;what&lt;/em&gt; this event really means – and, now that this faith has been undermined, how much must collapse because it was built on this faith, leaned on it, had grown into it – for example, our entire European morality. This long, dense succession of demolition, destruction, downfall, upheaval that now stands ahead: who would guess enough of it today to play the teacher and herald of this monstrous logic of horror, the prophet of deep darkness and an eclipse of the sun the like of which has probably never before existed on earth? Even we born guessers of riddles who are so to speak on a lookout at the top of the mountain, posted between today and tomorrow and stretched in the contradiction between today and tomorrow, we firstlings and premature births of the next century, to whom the shadows that must soon envelop Europe really &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; have become apparent by now – why is it that even we look forward to this darkening without any genuine involvement and above all without worry and fear for &lt;em&gt;ourselves?&lt;/em&gt; Are we perhaps still not too influenced by the &lt;em&gt;most immediate consequences&lt;/em&gt; of this event – and these immediate consequences, the consequences for &lt;em&gt;ourselves,&lt;/em&gt; are the opposite of what one might expect – not at all sad and gloomy, but much more like a new and barely describable type of light, happiness, relief, amusement, encouragement, dawn&amp;hellip; Indeed, at hearing the news that ‘the old god is dead’, we philosophers and ‘free spirits’ feel illuminated by a new dawn; our heart overflows with gratitude, amazement, forebodings, expectation – finally the horizon seems clear again, even if not bright; finally our ships may set out again, set out to face any danger; every daring of the lover of knowledge is allowed again; the sea, &lt;em&gt;our&lt;/em&gt; sea, lies open again; maybe there has never been such an ‘open sea’.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;In what way we, too, are still pious.&lt;/em&gt; – In science, convictions have no right to citizenship, as one says with good reason: only when they decide to step down to the modesty of a hypothesis, a tentative experimental standpoint, a regulative fiction,1 may they be granted admission and even a certain value in the realm of knowledge – though always with the restriction that they remain under police supervision, under the police of mistrust. But doesn’t this mean, on closer consideration, that a conviction is granted admission to science only when it &lt;em&gt;ceases&lt;/em&gt; to be a conviction? Wouldn’t the cultivation of the scientific spirit begin when one permitted oneself no more convictions? That is probably the case; only we need still ask: &lt;em&gt;in order that this cultivation begin,&lt;/em&gt; must there not be some prior conviction – and indeed one so authoritative and unconditional that it sacrifices all other convictions to itself? We see that science, too, rests on a faith; there is simply no ‘presuppositionless’ science. The question whether &lt;em&gt;truth&lt;/em&gt; is necessary must get an answer in advance, the answer ‘yes’, and moreover this answer must be so firm that it takes the form of the statement, the belief, the conviction: &lt;em&gt;‘Nothing&lt;/em&gt; is &lt;em&gt;more&lt;/em&gt; necessary than truth; and in relation to it, everything else has only secondary value.’ This unconditional will to truth – what is it? Is it the will not to let oneself be deceived? Is it the will &lt;em&gt;not to deceive?&lt;/em&gt; For the will to truth could be interpreted in this second way, too – if ‘I do not want to deceive &lt;em&gt;myself&lt;/em&gt;’ is included as a special case under the generalization ‘I do not want to deceive.’ But why not deceive? But why not allow oneself to be deceived? Note that the reasons for the former lie in a completely different area from those for the latter: one does not want to let oneself be deceived because one assumes it is harmful, dangerous, disastrous to be deceived; in this sense science would be a long-range prudence, caution, utility, and to this one could justifiably object: How so? Is it really less harmful, dangerous, disasterous not to want to let oneself be deceived? What do you know in advance about the character of existence to be able to decide whether the greater advantage is on the side of the unconditionally distrustful or of the unconditionally trusting? But should both be necessary – a lot of trust &lt;em&gt;as well as&lt;/em&gt; a lot of mistrust – then where might science get the unconditional belief or conviction on which it rests, that truth is more important than anything else, than every other conviction? Precisely this conviction could never have originated if truth &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; untruth had constantly made it clear they they were both useful, as they are. So, the faith in science, which after all undeniably exists, cannot owe its origin to such a calculus of utility; rather it must have originated &lt;em&gt;in spite of&lt;/em&gt; the fact that the disutility and dangerousness of ‘the will to truth’ or ‘truth at any price’ is proved to it constantly. ‘At any price’: we understand this well enough once we have offered and slaughtered one faith after another on this altar! Consequently, ‘will to truth’ does &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; mean ‘I do not want to let myself be deceived’ but – there is no alternative – ‘I will not deceive, not even myself’; &lt;em&gt;and with that we stand on moral ground.&lt;/em&gt; For you have only to ask yourself carefully, ‘Why do you not want to deceive?’ especially if it should seem – and it does seem! – as if life aimed at semblance, i.e. error, deception, simulation, blinding, self-blinding, and when life on the largest scale has actually always shown itself to be on the side of the most unscrupulous *polytropoi.*2 Charitably interpreted, such a resolve might perhaps be a quixotism, a slight, enthusiastic folly; but it could also be something worse, namely a principle that is hostile to life and destructive. ‘Will to truth’ – that could be a hidden will to death. Thus the question ‘Why science?’ leads back to the moral problem: &lt;em&gt;Why morality at all,&lt;/em&gt; if life, nature, and history are ‘immoral’? No doubt, those who are truthful in that audacious and ultimate sense which faith in science presupposes &lt;em&gt;thereby affirm another world&lt;/em&gt; than that of life, nature, and history; and insofar as they affirm this ‘other world’, must they not by the same token deny its counterpart, this world, &lt;em&gt;our&lt;/em&gt; world?&amp;hellip;But you will have gathered what I am getting at, namely, that it is still a &lt;em&gt;metaphysical faith&lt;/em&gt; upon which our faith in science rests – that even we knowers of today, we godless anti-metaphysicians, still take &lt;em&gt;our&lt;/em&gt; fire, too, from the flame lit by the thousand-year old faith, the Christian faith which was also Plato’s faith, that God is truth; that truth is divine&amp;hellip; But what if this were to become more and more difficult to believe, if nothing more were to turn out to be divine except error, blindness, the lie – if God himself were to turn out to be our longest lie?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Morality as a problem.&lt;/em&gt; – The lack of personality always takes its revenge: a weakened, thin, extinguished personality, one that denies itself and its own existence, is no longer good for anything good – least of all for philosophy. ‘Selflessness’ has no value in heaven or on earth; all great problems demand &lt;em&gt;great love,&lt;/em&gt; and only strong, round, secure minds who have a firm grip on themselves are capable of that. It makes the most telling difference whether a thinker has a personal relationship to his problems and finds in them his destiny, his distress, and his greatest happiness, or an ‘impersonal’ one, meaning he is only able to touch and grasp them with the antennae of cold, curious thought. In the latter case nothing will come of it, that much can be promised; for even if great problems should let themselves be &lt;em&gt;grasped&lt;/em&gt; by them, they would not allow frogs and weaklings to &lt;em&gt;hold on&lt;/em&gt; to them; such has been their taste from time immemorial – a taste, incidentally, that they share with all doughty females. Why, then, have I never yet encountered anyone, not even in books, who approached morality in this personal way and who knew morality as a problem, and this problem as his own personal distress, torment, voluptuousness, and passion? It is clear that up to now, morality has been no problem at all but rather that on which, after all mistrust, discord, and contradiction, one could agree – the hallowed place of peace where thinkers took a rest from themselves, took a deep breath, and felt revived. I see no one who has ventured a &lt;em&gt;critique&lt;/em&gt; of moral valuations; I miss even the slightest attempts of scientific curiosity, of the coddled, experimental imagination of psychologists and historians that easily anticipates a problem and seizes it in flight without knowing what it has caught. I have hardly detected a few meagre preliminary efforts to explore the &lt;em&gt;history of origins&lt;/em&gt; of these feelings and valuations (which is something quite different from a critique and again different from a history of ethical systems): in one single case I did everything to encourage a sympathy and talent for this kind of history – in vain, as it seems to me today.3 These historians of morality (particularly, the Englishmen) do not amount to much: usually they themselves unsuspectingly stand under the command of a particular morality and, without knowing it, serve as its shield-bearers and followers, for example, by sharing that popular superstition of Christian Europe which people keep repeating so naively to this day, that what is characteristic of morality is selflessness, self-denial, self-sacrifice, or sympathy (&lt;em&gt;Mitgefühl&lt;/em&gt;) and compassion (&lt;em&gt;Mitleiden).&lt;/em&gt; Their usual mistaken premise is that they affirm some consensus among peoples, at least among tame peoples, concerning certain moral principles, and then conclude that these principles must be unconditionally binding also for you and me – or, conversely, they see that among different peoples moral valuations are &lt;em&gt;necessarily&lt;/em&gt; different and infer from this that &lt;em&gt;no&lt;/em&gt; morality is binding – both of which are equally childish. The mistake of the more subtle among them is that they uncover and criticize the possibly foolish opinions of a people about their morality, or of humanity about all human morality – opinions about its origin, its religious sanction, the myth of the free will and such things – and then think they have criticized the morality itself. But the value of the injunction ‘Thou Shalt’ is still fundamentally different from and independent of such opinions about it and the weeds of error that may have overgrown it – just as surely as the value of a medication for someone sick is totally independent of whether he thinks about medicine scientifically or the way an old woman thinks about it. A morality could even have grown &lt;em&gt;out of&lt;/em&gt; an error, and the realization of this fact would not as much as touch the problem of its value. Thus no one until now has examined the &lt;em&gt;value&lt;/em&gt; of that most famous of all medicines called morality; and for that, one must begin by &lt;em&gt;questioning&lt;/em&gt; it for once. Well then! Precisely that is our task.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Our question mark.&lt;/em&gt; – But you do not understand this? Indeed, people will have trouble understanding us. We are searching for words, perhaps also for ears. Who are we anyway? If we simply called ourselves godless (to use an old expression), or unbelievers, or even immoralists, we would not think that these words came near to describing us: we are all three of them, at too advanced a stage for anyone to comprehend – for &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt; to comprehend, my curious gentlemen – how it feels. No! No longer with the bitterness and passion of the one who has torn himself away and must turn his unbelief into another faith, a goal, a martyrdom! We have become hard-boiled, cold, and tough in the realization that the way of the world is not at all divine – even by human standards it is not rational, merciful, or just. We know it: the world we live in is ungodly, immoral, ‘inhuman’; for far too long we have interpreted it falsely and mendaciously, though according to our wish and will for veneration, that is, according to a &lt;em&gt;need.&lt;/em&gt; For man is a venerating animal! But he is also a mistrustful one; and that the world is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; worth what we thought is about the most certain thing our mistrust has finally gotten hold of. The more mistrust, the more philosophy. We take care not to claim that the world is worth &lt;em&gt;less;&lt;/em&gt; indeed, it would seem laughable to us today if man were to aim at inventing values that were supposed to &lt;em&gt;surpass&lt;/em&gt; the value of the real world. That is exactly what we have turned away from, as from an extravagant aberration of human vanity and unreason that for long was not recognized as such. It found its final expression in modern pessimism, and an older and stronger expression in the teaching of Buddha; but also Christianity includes it, more doubtfully and ambiguously, to be sure, but not for that reason less seductively. The whole attitude of ‘man &lt;em&gt;against&lt;/em&gt; the world’, of man as a ‘world-negating’ principle, of man as the measure of the value of things, as judge of the world who finally places existence itself on his scales and finds it too light – the monstrous stupidity of this attitude has finally dawned on us and we are sick of it; we laugh we soon as we encounter the juxtaposition of ‘man &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; world’, separated by the sublime presumptuousness of the little word ‘and!’ But by laughing, haven’t we simply taken contempt for man one step further? And thus also pessimism, the contempt for that existence which is knowable to &lt;em&gt;us?&lt;/em&gt; Have we not exposed ourselves to the suspicion of an opposition – an opposition between the world in which until now we were at home with our venerations – and which may have made it possible for us to &lt;em&gt;endure&lt;/em&gt; life – and another world &lt;em&gt;that we ourselves are:&lt;/em&gt; a relentless, fundamental, deepest suspicion concerning ourselves that is steadily gaining more and worse control over us Europeans and that could easily confront coming generations with the terrible Either/Or: ‘Either abolish your venerations or – &lt;em&gt;yourselves!’&lt;/em&gt; The latter would be nihilism; but would not the former also be – nihilism? That is &lt;em&gt;our&lt;/em&gt; question mark.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Believers and their need to believe.&lt;/em&gt; – The extent to which one needs a &lt;em&gt;faith&lt;/em&gt; in order to flourish, how much that is ‘firm’ and that one does not want shaken because one &lt;em&gt;clings&lt;/em&gt; to it – that is a measure of the degree of one’s strength (or, to speak more clearly, one’s weakness). Christianity, it seems to me, is still needed by most people in old Europe even today; hence it still finds believers. For that is how man is: an article of faith could be refuted to him a thousand times; as long as he needed it, he would consider it ‘true’ again and again, in accordance with that famous ‘proof of strength’4 of which the Bible speaks. Metaphysics is still needed by some, but so is that impetuous &lt;em&gt;demand for certainty&lt;/em&gt; that today discharges itself in scientific-positivistic form among great masses – the demand that one &lt;em&gt;wants&lt;/em&gt; by all means something to be firm (while owing to the fervour of this demand one treats the demonstration of this certainty more lightly and negligently): this is still the demand for foothold, support – in short, the &lt;em&gt;instinct of weakness&lt;/em&gt; that, to be sure, does not create sundry religions, forms of metaphysics, and convictions but does – preserve them. Indeed, around all these positivistic systems hover the fumes of a certain pessimistic gloom, something of a weariness, fatalism, disappointment, fear of new disappointment – or else self-dramatizing rage, a bad mood, the anarchism of exasperation and whatever other symptoms or masquerades there are of the feeling of weakness. Even the vehemence with which our cleverest contemporaries get lost in pitiful nooks and crevices such as patriotism (I refer to what the French call &lt;em&gt;chauvinisme&lt;/em&gt;5 and the Germans ‘German’), or in petty aesthetic creeds such as French naturalism (which enhances and exposes only the part of nature that simultaneously disgusts and amazes – today one likes to call it &lt;em&gt;la verité vraie&lt;/em&gt;6 –), or in Petersburg-style nihilism7 (meaning &lt;em&gt;faith in unbelief&lt;/em&gt; to the point of martyrdom), always indicates primarily the &lt;em&gt;need&lt;/em&gt; for faith, a foothold, backbone, support&amp;hellip; Faith is always most desired and most urgently needed where will is lacking; for will, as the affect of command, is the decisive mark of sovereignty and strength. That is, the less someone knows how to command, the more urgently does he desire someone who commands, who commands severely – a god, prince, the social order, doctor, father confessor, dogma, or party conscience. From this one might gather that both world religions, Buddhism and Christianity, may have owed their origin and especially their sudden spread to a tremendous &lt;em&gt;sickening of the will.&lt;/em&gt; And that is actually what happened: both religions encountered a demand for a ‘Thou Shalt’ that, through a sickening of the will, had increased to an absurd level and bordered on desperation; both religions were teachers of fanaticism in times of a slackening of the will and thereby offered innumerable people support, a new possibility of willing, a delight in willing. For fanaticism is the only ‘strength of the will’ that even the weak and insecure can be brought to attain, as a type of hypnosis of the entire sensual-intellectual system to the benefit of the excessive nourishment (hypertrophy) of a single point of view and feeling which is now dominant – the Christian calls it his &lt;em&gt;faith.&lt;/em&gt; Once a human being arrives at the basic conviction that he &lt;em&gt;must&lt;/em&gt; be commanded, he becomes ‘a believer’; conversely, one could conceive of a delight and power of self-determination, a &lt;em&gt;freedom&lt;/em&gt; of the will, in which the spirit takes leave of all faith and every wish for certainty, practised as it is in maintaining itself on light ropes and possibilities and dancing even beside abysses. Such a spirit would be the &lt;em&gt;free spirit&lt;/em&gt; par excellence.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;On the origin of scholars.&lt;/em&gt; – In Europe the scholar grows out of all kinds of classes and social conditions like a plant that requires no particular kind of soil: thus he belongs, essentially and involuntarily, to the bearers of the democratic idea. But this origin betrays itself. Once one has somewhat trained one’s eye to recognize in a scholarly book, in a scientific treatise, the scholar’s intellectual &lt;em&gt;idiosyncrasy&lt;/em&gt; – every scholar has one – and catch it in the act, one will almost always behind it come face to face with the scholar’s ‘prehistory’, his family, especially its occupations and crafts. Where the feeling, ‘This is now proven; I am done with it,’ is expressed, it is usually the ancestor in the blood and instincts of the scholar who from his standpoint approves of ‘the finished job’ – the faith in a proof is only the symptom of what in a hard-working family for ages has been considered ‘good work’. An example: the sons of all types of clerks and office workers, whose main task was always to organize various different kinds of material, to compartmentalize and in general to schematize, when they become scholars, show a tendency to consider a problem practically solved when they have merely schematized it. There are philosophers who are basically just schematizers – for them, the formal aspect of their fathers’ occupation has become content. The talent for classifications, for tables of categories, reveals something: one pays the price for being the child of one’s parents. The son of a lawyer will also, as a researcher, have to be a lawyer; he primarily wants his cause to win; secondarily perhaps also for it to be right. The sons of Protestant ministers and schoolteachers one recognizes by the naive certainty with which, as scholars, they take their case already to have been proven when they have merely stated it heartily and warmly; they are thoroughly used to being &lt;em&gt;believed,&lt;/em&gt; as that was part of their father’s craft. A Jew, on the other hand, in keeping with the characteristic occupations and the past of his people, is not at all used to being believed. Consider Jewish scholars in this light: they all have a high regard for logic, that is for &lt;em&gt;compelling&lt;/em&gt; agreement by force of reasons; they know that with logic, they are bound to win even when faced with class and race prejudices, where people do not willingly believe them. For nothing is more democratic than logic: it knows no regard for persons and takes even the crooked nose for straight. (Incidentally, Europe owes the Jews no small thanks for making its people more logical, for &lt;em&gt;cleanlier&lt;/em&gt; intellectual habits – none more so than the Germans, as a lamentably &lt;em&gt;déraisonnable&lt;/em&gt;8 race that even today first needs to be given a good mental drubbing. Wherever Jews have gained influence, they have taught people to make finer distinctions, draw more rigorous conclusions, and to write more clearly and cleanly; their task was always ‘to make a people “listen to &lt;em&gt;raison&lt;/em&gt;” ’.)&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Once again, the origin of the scholars.&lt;/em&gt; – To wish to preserve oneself is a sign of distress, of a limitation of the truly basic life-instinct, which aims at &lt;em&gt;the expansion of power&lt;/em&gt; and in so doing often enough risks and sacrifices self-preservation. It is symptomatic that certain philosophers, such as the consumptive Spinoza, took and indeed had to take just the so-called self-preservation instinct to be decisive:9 – they were simply people in distress. That today’s natural sciences have become so entangled with the Spinozistic dogma (most recently and crudely in Darwinism with its incredibly one-sided doctrine of ‘the struggle for existence’ –) is probably due to the descent of most natural scientists: in this regard they belong to ‘the people’, their ancestors were poor and lowly folks who knew all too intimately the difficulty of scraping by. English Darwinism exudes something like the stuffy air of English overpopulation, like the small people’s smell of indigence and overcrowding. As a natural scientist, however, one should get out of one’s human corner; and in nature, it is not distress which &lt;em&gt;rules,&lt;/em&gt; but rather abundance, squandering – even to the point of absurdity. The struggle for survival is only an &lt;em&gt;exception,&lt;/em&gt; a temporary restriction of the will to life; the great and small struggle revolves everywhere around preponderance, around growth and expansion, around power and in accordance with the will to power, which is simply the will to life.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

It was a &lt;em&gt;way of life&lt;/em&gt; that he bequeathed to man: his demeanour before the judges, before the officers, before his accusers—his demeanour on the &lt;em&gt;cross&lt;/em&gt;.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Heresy and witchcraft.&lt;/em&gt; – To think otherwise than is customary is much less the effect of a superior intellect than of strong, evil inclinations – detaching, isolating, defiant, gloating, and malicious inclinations. Heresy is the adjunct of witchcraft and surely no more harmless and least of all anything venerable. Heretics and witches are two species of evil people; what they have in common is that they also feel evil but are impelled by an unconquerable lust to harm what is prevailing (people or opinions). The Reformation, which was a kind of redoubling of the medieval spirit at a time when it was no longer accompanied by a good conscience, produced both in the greatest abundance.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;*In honour of the homines religiosi.*10 – The struggle against the church is certainly, among other things – for it means many things – also the struggle of the baser, meaner, more cheerful, more confiding, more superficial natures against the dominion of the graver, deeper, and more contemplative, that is, more evil and distrustful individuals who, with a long-standing suspicion about the value of existence, also brooded over their own worth: the base instinct of the people, its sensuality, its ‘good heart’, rebelled against them. The entire Roman Church rests on a Southern distrust of human nature which is always misunderstood in the North. The European South has inherited this suspicion from the deep Orient, from ancient mysterious Asia and its contemplation. Protestantism is, to be sure, an uprising in favour of the upright, the guileless, the shallow (the North has always been more good-natured and superficial than the South); but it was the French Revolution that finally and ceremoniously handed over the sceptre to the ‘good people’ (to the sheep, the donkey, the goose, and everything that is incurably shallow and loudmouthed and ripe for the madhouse of ‘modern ideas’).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;In honour of the priestly type:&lt;/em&gt; – I think that what the people mean by wisdom (and who today is not ‘people’?) – that prudent, cowlike serenity, piety and country parson meekness which lies in the meadow and earnestly and ruminantly &lt;em&gt;observes&lt;/em&gt; life – is also that from which precisely the philosophers have always felt the most remote, probably because they were not ‘people’ enough, not country parsons enough. They will presumably also be the last to learn to believe that the people &lt;em&gt;might&lt;/em&gt; come to understand something of that which is most remote from them, something of the great &lt;em&gt;passion&lt;/em&gt; of the knowledge-seeker who steadfastly lives, must live, in the thundercloud of the highest problems and the weightiest responsibilities (and thus in no way as an observer, outside, indifferent, secure, objective&amp;hellip;). The people venerate quite another type of person when they construct for themselves an ideal of the ‘sage’, and they have a thousandfold right to adore just this type of person with the best words and honours – the mild, serious/simple-minded and chaste priestly natures and whatever is related to them: they are the ones who are the objects of approbation when the common people reveres wisdom. And towards whom would the people have more reason to show themselves grateful than these men, who belong to and come from them, though as consecrated, chosen, sacrificed for the common good – they believe themselves sacrificed to God – , to whom the people can spill their hearts with impunity and &lt;em&gt;get rid of&lt;/em&gt; their secrets, worries and worse (– for he who ‘unbosoms’ himself is relieved of himself, and he who has ‘confessed’, forgets). Here reigns a great necessity: drainages and their clean, cleansing waters are needed also for the spiritual refuse; swift streams of love are needed, and strong, humble, pure hearts who prepare and sacrifice themselves for such an office of non-public health care – for it &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; a sacrifice; a priest is and remains a human sacrifice&amp;hellip;The people see such sacrificed, subdued, serious persons of ‘faith’ as &lt;em&gt;wise,&lt;/em&gt; that is, as having become knowing, as ‘certain’ in relation to their own uncertainty; and who would want to deprive them of this word and of their awe? But as is conversely fair, among philosophers a priest, too, is considered to be one of ‘the people’ and not a knower, primarily because philosophers do not themselves believe in ‘men of knowledge’ and already smell ‘the people’ in this belief and superstition. It was &lt;em&gt;modesty&lt;/em&gt; that in Greece coined the word ‘philosopher’ and left the extraordinary insolence of calling oneself wise to the actors of the spirit – the modesty of such monsters of pride and conceit as Pythagoras, as Plato –.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The extent to which morality is hardly dispensable.&lt;/em&gt; – The naked human being is generally a disgraceful sight – I am talking about us Europeans (and not even about female Europeans!). Supposing that by the mischievous trick of a sorcerer, the merriest dinner party suddenly saw itself exposed and undressed; I think not only the mirth would be lost but also the strongest appetite discouraged, – it seems we Europeans are utterly unable to dispense with that masquerade called clothing. But why should there not be equally good reasons for the disguise of ‘moral men’, for their veil of moral formulas and notions of decency, for the whole benevolent concealment of our actions behind the concepts of duty, virtue, public spirit, respectability, self-denial? I am not supposing that something like human malice and perfidy – in short, the bad wild beast in us – is thereby disguised; my thought is, quite on the contrary, that it is precisely as &lt;em&gt;tame animals&lt;/em&gt; that are we a disgraceful sight and need the disguise of morality, – that the ‘inner man’ in Europe is not nearly evil enough to be able to ‘show himself’ that way (and be &lt;em&gt;beautiful&lt;/em&gt; that way –). The European disguises himself &lt;em&gt;with morality&lt;/em&gt; because he has become a sick, sickly, maimed animal which has good reasons for being ‘tame’; because he is almost a monstrosity, something half, weak, awkward&amp;hellip;It is not the ferocity of the beast of prey that needs a moral disguise, but the herd animal with its deep mediocrity, fear, and boredom with itself. &lt;em&gt;Morality dresses up the European&lt;/em&gt; – let’s admit it! – into something nobler, grander, goodlier, something ‘divine’ –&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;On the origin of religions.&lt;/em&gt; – The true invention of the religion-founders is first to establish a certain way of life and everyday customs that work as a &lt;em&gt;disciplina voluntatis&lt;/em&gt;11 while at the same time removing boredom; and then to give just this life an &lt;em&gt;interpretation&lt;/em&gt; that makes it appear illuminated by the highest worth, so that henceforth it becomes a good for which one fights and under certain circumstances even gives one’s life. Actually, the second invention is the more important: the first, the way of life, was usually already in place, though alongside other ways of life and without any consciousness of its special worth. The significance, the originality of the religion-founder usually lies in his &lt;em&gt;seeing&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;selecting&lt;/em&gt; this way of life, in his &lt;em&gt;guessing&lt;/em&gt; for the first time what it can be used for and how it can be interpreted. Jesus (or Paul), for example, discovered the life of the small people in the Roman province, a humble, virtuous, depressed life: he explained it, he put the highest meaning and value into it – and thereby also the courage to despise every other way of life, the silent Moravian brotherhood12 fanaticism, the clandestine subterranean self-confidence that grows and grows and is finally ready to ‘overcome the world’ (i.e. Rome and the upper classes throughout the empire). Buddha likewise discovered, scattered indeed among all classes and social strata of his people, that type of person who is good and gracious (above all, inoffensive) out of laziness and who, also from laziness, lives abstinently and with nearly no needs at all: he understood how such a type of person would inevitably, with all of his &lt;em&gt;vis inertiae&lt;/em&gt;,13 have to roll into a faith that promises to &lt;em&gt;prevent&lt;/em&gt; the return of earthly toil (i.e. of work and action in general), – this ‘understanding’ was his genius. The religion-founder must be psychologically infallible in his knowledge of a certain average breed of souls who have not yet &lt;em&gt;recognized&lt;/em&gt; one another as allies. He is the one who brings them together; and to that extent, the establishment of a religion always turns into a long festival of recognition. –&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;On ‘the genius of the species’.&lt;/em&gt; – The problem of consciousness (or rather, of becoming conscious of something) first confronts us when we begin to realize how much we can do without it; and now we are brought to this initial realization by physiology and natural history (which have thus required two hundred years to catch up with &lt;em&gt;Leibniz’s&lt;/em&gt; precocious suspicion).14 For we could think, feel, will, remember, and also ‘act’ in every sense of the term, and yet none of all this would have to ‘enter our consciousness’ (as one says figuratively). All of life would be possible without, as it were, seeing itself in the mirror; and still today, the predominant part of our lives actually unfolds without this mirroring – of course also our thinking, feeling, and willing lives, insulting as it may sound to an older philosopher. &lt;em&gt;To what end&lt;/em&gt; does consciousness exist at all when it is basically superfluous? If one is willing to hear my answer and its possibly extravagant conjecture, it seems to me that the subtlety and strength of consciousness is always related to a person’s (or animal’s) &lt;em&gt;ability to communicate;&lt;/em&gt; and the ability to communicate, in turn, to the &lt;em&gt;need to communicate.&lt;/em&gt; The latter should not to be taken to mean that precisely that individual who is a master at expressing his needs and at making them understood must also be the most dependent on others in his needs. But for entire races and lineages, this seems to me to hold: where need and distress have for a long time forced people to communicate, to understand each other swiftly and subtly, there finally exists a surplus of this power and art of expression, a faculty, so to speak, which has slowly accumulated and now waits for an heir to spend it lavishly (the so-called artists are the heirs, as well as the orators, preachers, writers – all of them people who come at the end of a long chain, each of them ‘born late’ in the best sense of the term, and each of them, again, &lt;em&gt;squanderers&lt;/em&gt; by nature). Assuming this observation is correct, I may go on to conjecture that &lt;em&gt;consciousness in general has developed only under the pressure of the need to communicate;&lt;/em&gt; that at the outset, consciousness was necessary, was useful, only between persons (particularly between those who commanded and those who obeyed); and that it has developed only in proportion to that usefulness. Consciousness is really just a net connecting one person with another – only in this capacity did it have to develop; the solitary and predatory person would not have needed it. That our actions, thoughts, feelings, and movements – at least some of them – even enter into consciousness is the result of a terrible ‘must’ which has ruled over man for a long time: as the most endangered animal, he &lt;em&gt;needed&lt;/em&gt; help and protection, he needed his equals; he had to express his neediness and be able to make himself understood – and to do so, he first needed ‘consciousness’, i.e. even to ‘know’ what distressed him, to ‘know’ how he felt, to ‘know’ what he thought. For, once again: man, like every living creature, is constantly thinking but does not know it; the thinking which becomes &lt;em&gt;conscious&lt;/em&gt; is only the smallest part of it, let’s say the shallowest, worst part – for only that conscious thinking &lt;em&gt;takes place in words, that is, in communication symbols;&lt;/em&gt; and this fact discloses the origin of consciousness. In short, the development of language and the development of consciousness (&lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; of reason but strictly of the way in which we become conscious of reason) go hand in hand. One might add that not only language serves as a bridge between persons, but also look, touch, and gesture; without our becoming conscious of our sense impressions, our power to fix them and as it were place them outside of ourselves, has increased in proportion to the need to convey them &lt;em&gt;to others&lt;/em&gt; by means of signs. The sign-inventing person is also the one who becomes ever more acutely conscious of himself; for only as a social animal did man learn to become conscious of himself – he is still doing it, and he is doing it more and more. My idea is clearly that consciousness actually belongs not to man’s existence as an individual but rather to the community- and herd-aspects of his nature; that accordingly, it is finely developed only in relation to its usefulness to community or herd; and that consequently each of us, even with the best will in the world to &lt;em&gt;understand&lt;/em&gt; ourselves as individually as possible, ‘to know ourselves’, will always bring to consciousness precisely that in ourselves which is ‘non-individual’, that which is ‘average’; that due to the nature of consciousness – to the ‘genius of the species’ governing it – our thoughts themselves are continually as it were &lt;em&gt;outvoted&lt;/em&gt; and translated back into the herd perspective. At bottom, all our actions are incomparably and utterly personal, unique, and boundlessly individual, there is no doubt; but as soon as we translate them into consciousness, &lt;em&gt;they no longer seem to be&lt;/em&gt;&amp;hellip;This is what &lt;em&gt;I&lt;/em&gt; consider to be true phenomenalism and perspectivism: that due to the nature of &lt;em&gt;animal consciousness,&lt;/em&gt; the world of which we can become conscious is merely a surface- and sign-world, a world turned into generalities and thereby debased to its lowest common denominator, – that everything which enters consciousness thereby &lt;em&gt;becomes&lt;/em&gt; shallow, thin, relatively stupid, general, a sign, a herd-mark; that all becoming conscious involves a vast and thorough corruption, falsification, superficialization, and generalization. In the end, the growing consciousness is a danger; and he who lives among the most conscious Europeans even knows it is a sickness. As one might guess, it is not the opposition between subject and object which concerns me here; I leave that distinction to those epistemologists who have got tangled up in the snares of grammar (of folk metaphysics). Even less am I concerned with the opposition between ‘thing in itself’ and appearance: for we ‘know’ far too little to even be entitled to &lt;em&gt;make&lt;/em&gt; that distinction. We simply have no organ for &lt;em&gt;knowing,&lt;/em&gt; for ‘truth’: we ‘know’ (or believe or imagine) exactly as much as is &lt;em&gt;useful&lt;/em&gt; to the human herd, to the species: and even what is here called ‘usefulness’ is finally also just a belief, a fiction, and perhaps just that supremely fatal stupidity of which we some day will perish.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The origin of our concept of ‘knowledge’&lt;/em&gt;. – I take this explanation from the street; I heard one of the common people say ‘he knew me right away’ – and I asked myself: what do the people actually take knowledge to be? what do they want when they want ‘knowledge’? Nothing more than this: something unfamiliar is to be traced back to something &lt;em&gt;familiar.&lt;/em&gt; And we philosophers – have we really meant anything &lt;em&gt;more&lt;/em&gt; by knowledge? The familiar means what we are used to, so that we no longer marvel at it; the commonplace; some rule in which we are stuck; each and every thing that makes us feel at home: – And isn’t our need for knowledge precisely this need for the familiar, the will to uncover among everything strange, unusual, and doubtful something which no longer unsettles us? Is it not the &lt;em&gt;instinct of fear&lt;/em&gt; that bids us to know? And isn’t the rejoicing of the person who attains knowledge just rejoicing from a regained sense of security?&amp;hellip;Take the philosopher who imagined the world to be ‘known’ when he had reduced it to the ‘idea’; wasn’t it precisely because the ‘idea’ was so familiar to him and he was so used to it? because he no longer feared the ‘idea’? – How little these men of knowledge demand! Just look at their principles and their solutions to the world riddle with this in mind! When they find something in, under, or behind things which unfortunately happens to be very familiar to us, such as our multiplication table or our logic or our willing and desiring, how happy they are right away! For ‘what is familiar is known’: on this they agree. Even the most cautious among them assume that the familiar can at least be &lt;em&gt;more easily known&lt;/em&gt; than the strange; that for example sound method demands that we start from the ‘inner world’, from the ‘facts of consciousness’, because this world is &lt;em&gt;more familiar to us.&lt;/em&gt; Error of errors! The familiar is what we are used to, and what we are used to is the most difficult to ‘know’ – that is, to view as a problem, to see as strange, as distant, as ‘outside us’&amp;hellip;The great certainty of the natural sciences in comparison with psychology and the critique of the elements of consciousness – with the &lt;em&gt;unnatural&lt;/em&gt; sciences, one might almost say – rests precisely on the fact that they take the &lt;em&gt;strange&lt;/em&gt; as their object, while it is nearly contradictory and absurd even to &lt;em&gt;want&lt;/em&gt; to take the not-strange as one’s object&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The extent to which things will become ever more ‘artistic’ in Europe.&lt;/em&gt; – Even today, in this transitional period in which so many forms of coercion have lost their power, the need to make a living still forces nearly all European men to adopt a particular role – their so-called profession. A few retain the freedom, an apparent freedom, to choose this role themselves; for most of them it is chosen. The result is strange enough. Almost all Europeans, at an advanced age, confuse themselves with their role; they become the victims of their ‘good performance’; they themselves have forgotten how much they were determined by accidents, moods, and arbitrariness at the time that their ‘profession’ was decided – and how many other roles they may have been &lt;em&gt;able&lt;/em&gt; to play; for now it is too late! Upon deeper consideration, the role has actually &lt;em&gt;become&lt;/em&gt; character; and artifice, nature. There were times when men believed with unyielding confidence, even with piety, in their predestination for just this business, just this way of making a living, and utterly refused to acknowledge the element of accident, role, and caprice. With the help of this faith, estates, guilds, and inherited trade privileges were able to establish those monsters, the broad-based social pyramids that distinguished the middle ages and to which one can credit at least one thing: durability (and durability is a first-rank value on earth). But there are contrary ages, the truly democratic ones, in which people unlearn this faith and a certain audacious faith and opposite viewpoint moves steadily into the foreground – the Athenian faith that first became noticeable in the Periclean age;15 the American faith which is increasingly becoming the European faith as well, where the individual is convinced he can do just about anything &lt;em&gt;and is up to playing any role;&lt;/em&gt; and everyone experiments with himself, improvises, experiments again, enjoys experimenting, where all nature ends and becomes art&amp;hellip;When the Greeks had fully accepted this &lt;em&gt;faith in roles&lt;/em&gt; – the faith of artistes, if you will – they underwent, as is well known, step by step an odd metamorphosis that is not in every respect worthy of imitation: &lt;em&gt;they really became actors;&lt;/em&gt; as such they captivated and overcame the whole world – finally even the ‘power that overcame the whole world’ itself (for it was not, as innocents tend to say, Greek culture that conquered Rome, but the &lt;em&gt;graeculus histrio16).&lt;/em&gt; But what I fear, what even today one could grasp with one’s hands if one felt like grasping it, is that we modern men are pretty much on the same road; and every time man starts to discover the extent to which he is playing a role and the extent to which he &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; be an actor, he &lt;em&gt;becomes&lt;/em&gt; an actor&amp;hellip;With this, a new human flora and fauna emerges that cannot grow in firmer and more limited ages – or that would at least be formally condemned and suspected of lacking honour; it is thus that the most interesting and maddest ages always emerge, in which ‘the actors’, &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; types of actors, are the real masters. Precisely because of this, another human type becomes ever more disadvantaged and is finally made impossible; above all, the great ‘architects’: the strength to build is now paralysed; the courage to make far-reaching plans is discouraged; the organizational geniuses become scarce – who still dares to undertake works that would &lt;em&gt;require&lt;/em&gt; millennia to complete? For what is dying out is that fundamental faith on the basis of which someone could calculate, promise, anticipate the future in a plan on that grand scale, and sacrifice the future to his plan – namely, the basic faith that man has worth and sense only in so far as he is &lt;em&gt;a stone in a great edifice;&lt;/em&gt; to this end he must be &lt;em&gt;firm&lt;/em&gt; above all, a ‘stone’&amp;hellip;above all not an actor! To put it briefly – oh, people will keep silent about it for a long time! – what from now on will never again be built, &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; never again be built, is – a society in the old sense of the term; to build that, everything is lacking, mainly the material. &lt;em&gt;We are all no longer material for a society;&lt;/em&gt; this is a timely truth! It is a matter of indifference to me that at present the most shortsighted, perhaps the most honest, at any rate the noisiest human type that we have today – our good socialists – believe, hope, dream, and above all shout and write pretty much the opposite. For even now one reads their slogan for the future ‘free society’ on all tables and walls. Free society? Well, well! But surely you know, gentlemen, what one needs to build that? Wooden iron!17 The famous wooden iron! And it need not even be wooden&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;On the old problem: ‘What is German?’&lt;/em&gt; – Add up for yourself the real achievements in philosophical thinking that can be attributed to Germans: is there any legitimate sense in which one can credit them to the entire race? Can we say that they are also the work of the ‘German soul’, or at least symptoms of it in the same sense in which we are accustomed to take Plato’s ideomania, his nearly religious lunacy about forms, as a development and testimony of ‘the Greek soul’? Or would the opposite be true? Would they be just so individual, just so much &lt;em&gt;exceptions&lt;/em&gt; to the spirit of the race as was, for instance, Goethe’s paganism with a good conscience? Or as is Bismarck’s Machiavellianism with a good conscience, his so-called &lt;em&gt;Realpolitik,&lt;/em&gt; among Germans? Might our philosophers perhaps even contradict the &lt;em&gt;need&lt;/em&gt; of the ‘German soul’? In short, were the German philosophers really – philosophical &lt;em&gt;Germans?&lt;/em&gt; I recall three cases. First, &lt;em&gt;Leibniz’s&lt;/em&gt; incomparable insight18 that has been vindicated not only against Descartes but also against everyone who had philosophized before him – that consciousness (&lt;em&gt;Bewutheit&lt;/em&gt;)19 is merely an &lt;em&gt;accidens&lt;/em&gt;20 of the power of representation (&lt;em&gt;Vorstellung&lt;/em&gt;) and &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; its necessary and essential attribute; so that what we call consciousness (&lt;em&gt;Bewutsein&lt;/em&gt;) constitutes only one state of our spiritual and psychic world (perhaps a sick state) and &lt;em&gt;by no means the whole of it&lt;/em&gt; – is there something German to this idea, the profundity of which has not been exhausted to this day? Is there reason to surmise that no Latin could easily have thought of this reversal of appearances? For it is a reversal. Let us recall, secondly, &lt;em&gt;Kant’s&lt;/em&gt; colossal question mark that he placed on the concept ‘causality’21 – without, like Hume, doubting its legitimacy altogether: he started much more cautiously to delimit the realm in which this concept makes any sense whatsoever (and to this day we have not yet come to terms with this marking out of the boundaries). Let us take, thirdly, &lt;em&gt;Hegel’s&lt;/em&gt; astonishing move, with which he struck through all logical habits and indulgences when he dared to teach that species concepts develop *out of each other:*22 with this proposition the minds of Europe were preformed for the last great scientific movement, Darwinism – for without Hegel there could be no Darwin. Is there anything German in this Hegelian innovation which first introduced the decisive concept of ‘development’ into science? Yes, without any doubt: in all three cases we feel that something in ourselves has been ‘uncovered’ and figured out, and we are grateful and at the same time surprised. Each of these three propositions is a thoughtful piece of German self-knowledge, self-experience, and self-conception. ‘Our inner world is much richer, more comprehensive, more hidden’, we feel with Leibniz. As Germans, we doubt with Kant the ultimate validity of the discoveries of the natural sciences and altogether of everything that &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; be known &lt;em&gt;causaliter&lt;/em&gt;23 – what is knowable already seems to us of &lt;em&gt;less&lt;/em&gt; value on that account. We Germans are Hegelians even had there been no Hegel, insofar as we (as opposed to all Latins) instinctively attribute a deeper meaning and greater value to becoming and development than to what ‘is’; we hardly believe in the justification of the concept ‘being’ – and also insofar as we are not inclined to concede that our human logic is logic as such or the only kind of logic (we would rather persuade ourselves that it is only a special case and perhaps one of the oddest and stupidest). A fourth question would be whether &lt;em&gt;Schopenhauer,&lt;/em&gt; too, with his pessimism – that is, the problem of the &lt;em&gt;value of existence&lt;/em&gt;24 – had to be precisely a German. I believe not. The event &lt;em&gt;after&lt;/em&gt; which this problem was to be expected with certainty, so that an astronomer of the soul could have calculated the very day and hour for it – the decline of the faith in the Christian god, the triumph of scientific atheism – is a pan-European event in which all races had their share and for which all deserve credit and honour. Conversely, one might charge precisely the Germans – those Germans who were contemporaries of Schopenhauer – with having &lt;em&gt;delayed&lt;/em&gt; this triumph of atheism most dangerously for the longest time. Hegel in particular was a delayer par excellence, in accordance with his grandiose attempt to persuade us of the divinity of existence, appealing as a last resort to our sixth sense, ‘the historical sense’. As a philosopher, Schopenhauer was the &lt;em&gt;first&lt;/em&gt; admitted and uncompromising atheist among us Germans: this was the background of his enmity towards Hegel. The ungodliness of existence counted for him as something given, palpable, indisputable; he always lost his philosopher’s composure and became indignant when he saw anyone hesitate or beat around the bush on this point. This is the locus of his whole integrity; unconditional and honest atheism is simply the &lt;em&gt;presupposition&lt;/em&gt; of his way of putting the problem, as a victory of the European conscience won finally and with great difficulty; as the most fateful act of two thousand years of discipline for truth that in the end forbids itself the &lt;em&gt;lie&lt;/em&gt; of faith in God&amp;hellip;One can see &lt;em&gt;what&lt;/em&gt; it was that actually triumphed over the Christian god: Christian morality itself, the concept of truthfulness that was taken ever more rigorously; the father confessor’s refinement of the Christian conscience, translated and sublimated into a scientific conscience, into intellectual cleanliness at any price. Looking at nature as if it were proof of the goodness and care of a god; interpreting history in honour of some divine reason, as a continual testimony of a moral world order and ultimate moral purposes; interpreting one’s own experiences as pious people have long interpreted theirs, as if everything were providential, a hint, designed and ordained for the sake of salvation of the soul – that is &lt;em&gt;over&lt;/em&gt; now; that has conscience &lt;em&gt;against&lt;/em&gt; it; every refined conscience considers it to be indecent, dishonest, a form of mendacity, effeminacy, weakness, cowardice. With this severity, if with anything, we are simply &lt;em&gt;good&lt;/em&gt; Europeans and heirs of Europe’s longest and most courageous self-overcoming. As we thus reject Christian interpretation and condemn its ‘meaning’ as counterfeit, &lt;em&gt;Schopenhauer’s&lt;/em&gt; question immediately comes at us in a terrifying way: &lt;em&gt;Does existence have any meaning at all?&lt;/em&gt; A few centuries will be needed before this question can ever be heard completely and in its full depth. What Schopenhauer himself said in answer to this question was – forgive me – something hasty, youthful, a mere compromise, a way of remaining and staying stuck in precisely those Christian and ascetic moral perspectives in which one had &lt;em&gt;renounced faith&lt;/em&gt; along with the faith in God. But he &lt;em&gt;posed&lt;/em&gt; the question – as a good European, as I said before, and &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; as a German. Or is it possible that at least the manner in which the Germans appropriated Schopenhauer’s question proves that the Germans did have an inner affinity and relation, preparation, and &lt;em&gt;need&lt;/em&gt; for this problem? That after Schopenhauer one thought and printed things in Germany, too – by the way, late enough – about the problem he had posed is certainly not sufficient to decide in favour of this closer affinity. One might rather adduce the peculiar &lt;em&gt;ineptitude&lt;/em&gt; of this post-Schopenhauerian pessimism &lt;em&gt;against&lt;/em&gt; the thesis; clearly the Germans did not behave in this affair as if they were in their element. This is by no means an allusion to Eduard von Hartmann.25 On the contrary, to this day I have not shaken off my old suspicion that he is too &lt;em&gt;apt&lt;/em&gt; for us. I mean that he may have been a real rogue from the start who perhaps made fun not only of German pessimism – but in the end he might even reveal to the Germans in his last will and testament to what extent it was possible to make fools of them, even in an era of economic initiative and success.26 But let me ask you: should we perhaps consider that old humming-top Bahnsen27 as a credit to the Germans, seeing how voluptuously he revolved his life around his real-dialectical misery and ‘personal bad luck’? Might precisely that be German? (I herewith recommend his writings to the end for which I have used them myself, as an anti-pessimistic diet, especially on account of their &lt;em&gt;elegantiae psychologicae,28&lt;/em&gt; with which, I think, they should be effective also for the most constipated bowels and temperaments.) Or could one count such dilettantes and old spinsters as that mawkish apostle of virginity, Mainlander,29 as a genuine German? In the end he must have been a Jew (all Jews become mawkish when they moralize). Neither Bahnsen nor Mainlander, nor even Eduard von Hartmann, gives us any clear evidence regarding the question whether Schopenhauer’s pessimism, his horrified look into a de-deified world that had become stupid, blind, crazed, and questionable, his &lt;em&gt;honest&lt;/em&gt; horror&amp;hellip;was not merely an exception among Germans but a &lt;em&gt;German&lt;/em&gt; event. Everything else that is otherwise in the foreground – our brave politics, our merry fatherlandishness which resolutely enough consider all matters with a view to a not very philosophical principle (‘Deutschland, Deutschland über alles’30), i.e. *sub specie speciei,*31 namely the German species, bears emphatic witness to the opposite. No, the Germans of today are &lt;em&gt;no&lt;/em&gt; pessimists. And Schopenhauer was a pessimist, to repeat, as a good European and &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; as a German. –&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The peasant rebellion of the spirit.&lt;/em&gt; – We Europeans confront a world of tremendous ruins. A few things are still towering; much looks decayed and uncanny, while most things are already lying on the ground: picturesque enough – where has one ever seen more beautiful ruins? – and overgrown by large and small weeds. The Church is this city of decline: we see the religious society of Christianity shaken to its lowest foundations; faith in God has collapsed; faith in the Christian-ascetic ideal is still fighting its last battle. An edifice such as Christianity that had been built so carefully over such a long period – it was the last Roman construction! – could of course not be destroyed all at once. All kinds of earthquakes had to shake it; all kinds of minds (&lt;em&gt;Geist&lt;/em&gt;) that drill, dig, gnaw, and moisten have had to help. But the oddest thing is: those who exerted themselves the most to preserve and conserve Christianity have become its best destroyers – the Germans. It seems that the Germans do not understand the nature of a church. Are they not spiritual enough for that? Not mistrustful enough? The edifice of the Church rests, at any rate, on a &lt;em&gt;Southern&lt;/em&gt; freedom and liberality of the mind as well as on a Southern suspicion against nature, man, and spirit; it rests on an altogether different knowledge and experience of man than the North has had. The Lutheran Reformation was, in its whole breadth, the indignation of simplicity against ‘multiplicity’, to speak cautiously, a crude, naively narrow-minded misunderstanding in which there is much to forgive. One failed to understand the expression of a &lt;em&gt;victorious&lt;/em&gt; church and saw only corruption; one misunderstood the noble scepticism, that &lt;em&gt;luxury&lt;/em&gt; of scepticism and tolerance which every victorious, self-confident power permits itself&amp;hellip;Today one overlooks easily enough how in all cardinal questions of power Luther was dangerously short-sighted, superficial, incautious – mainly as a man of the common people who lacked any inheritance from a ruling caste and instinct for power; thus his work, his will to restore that work of the Romans only became the beginning of a work of destruction, without his wanting and knowing it. With honest wrath he unravelled, he tore up what the old spider had woven so carefully for such a long time. He surrendered the holy books to everyone – thus they finally ended up in the hands of the philologists, who are the destroyers of every faith that rests on books. He destroyed the concept of the ‘Church’ by throwing away the belief in the inspiration of the church councils; for the concept of the ‘Church’ retains power only under the condition that the inspiring spirit that founded the Church still lives in, builds, and continues to build its house. He gave back to the priest sexual intercourse with a woman; but three-quarters of the reverence of which the people, especially the women of the people, are capable rests on the faith that a person who is an exception in this regard will be an exception in other regards as well – it is here precisely that the popular faith in something superhuman in man, in the miracle, in the redeeming god in man, finds its subtlest and most insidious advocate. Having given the priest woman, Luther had to &lt;em&gt;take&lt;/em&gt; from him auricular confession; that was psychologically right, but with that development the Christian priest was basically abolished, since his deepest utility has always been that he was a holy ear, a silent well, a grave for secrets. ‘Everyone his own priest’ – behind such formulas and their peasant cunning was hidden in Luther the abysmal hatred of ‘the higher human beings’ and the dominion of ‘the higher human beings’ as conceived by the Church; he smashed an ideal that he could not attain, while he seemed to fight and abhor the degeneration of this ideal. Actually he, the impossible monk, pushed away the &lt;em&gt;dominion&lt;/em&gt; of the *homines religiosi,*32 and thus he himself brought about within the &lt;em&gt;ecclesiastical&lt;/em&gt; social order what in relation to the &lt;em&gt;civil&lt;/em&gt; social order he attacked so intolerantly – a ‘peasants’ rebellion’. What grew out of his Reformation afterwards, good as well as bad, might be roughly calculated today; but who would be naive enough to praise or blame Luther on account of these consequences? He is innocent of everything; he did not know what he was doing. The flattening of the European mind, particularly in the North – its &lt;em&gt;becoming more good-natured,&lt;/em&gt; if one prefers a moral term – advanced a large step with the Lutheran Reformation, there is no doubt; and owing to it also the flexibility and restlessness of the mind, its thirst for independence, its faith in a right to liberty, its ‘naturalness’. If in connection with this last point one wanted to give it the credit for having prepared and favoured what we today honour as ‘modern science’, one must surely add that it also shares the blame for the degeneration of the modern scholar, for his lack of reverence, shame, and depth, for the whole naive guilelessness and conventionality in matters of knowledge – in short for that &lt;em&gt;plebeianism of the spirit&lt;/em&gt; that is peculiar to the last two centuries and from which even pessimism has not yet liberated us. ‘Modern ideas’ also belong to this peasant rebellion of the North against the colder, more ambiguous, mistrustful spirit of the South that built its greatest monument in the Christian Church. Let us not forget in the end what a church is, specifically as opposed to any ‘state’. A church is above all a structure for ruling that secures the highest rank to the &lt;em&gt;more spiritual&lt;/em&gt; human beings and that &lt;em&gt;believes&lt;/em&gt; in the power of spirituality to the extent of forbidding itself the use of all cruder instruments of force; and on that score alone the Church is under all circumstances a &lt;em&gt;nobler&lt;/em&gt; institution than the state.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The revenge against the spirit and other ulterior motives of morality.&lt;/em&gt; – Morality – where do you suppose that it finds its most dangerous and insidious advocates?&amp;hellip;There is a human being who has turned out badly, who does not have spirit enough to be able to enjoy it and just enough education to know this; bored, weary, a self-despiser; wealthy through inheritance, he is deprived even of the last comfort, ‘the blessings of work’, self-forgetfulness in ‘daily labour’. Such a person who is basically ashamed of his existence – perhaps he also harbours a few small vices – and on the other hand cannot keep himself from becoming more spoiled and touchy as a result of reading books he has no right to or through more spiritual company than he can digest: such a thoroughly poisoned human being – for spirit becomes poison, education becomes poison; ownership becomes poison, loneliness becomes poison in persons who have turned out badly in this way – eventually ends up in a state of habitual revenge, the will to revenge&amp;hellip;&lt;em&gt;What&lt;/em&gt; do you think he finds necessary, absolutely necessary, to give himself in his own eyes the appearance of superiority over more spiritual people and to obtain the pleasure of an &lt;em&gt;accomplished revenge&lt;/em&gt; at least in his own imagination? Always &lt;em&gt;morality;&lt;/em&gt; you can bet on that. Always big moral words. Always the boom-boom of justice, wisdom, holiness, virtue. Always the Stoicism of gesture (how well Stoicism conceals what one lacks!). Always the cloak of prudent silence, of affability, of mildness, and whatever the other idealistic cloaks may be called under which incurable self-despisers, as well as the incurably vain, go about. Do not misunderstand me: among such born &lt;em&gt;enemies of the spirit&lt;/em&gt; emerges occasionally the rare piece of humanity that the people revere under such names as saint and sage. From among such men come those monsters of morality who make noise, who make history – St Augustine33 is among them. Fear of spirit, revenge against spirit – oh how often have these propelling vices become the roots of virtues! Indeed, &lt;em&gt;become&lt;/em&gt; virtues! And, as a question asked in confidence: even that philosopher’s claim to &lt;em&gt;wisdom&lt;/em&gt; which has been made here and there on earth; the maddest and most immodest of all claims – was it not always, in India as well as in Greece, &lt;em&gt;primarily a hiding place?&lt;/em&gt; At times perhaps a hiding place chosen with pedagogical intent, which hallows so many lies; one has a tender regard for those who are still becoming, growing – for disciples who must often be defended against themselves through faith in a person (through an error)&amp;hellip;In most cases, however, it is a hiding place in which the philosopher saves himself owing to weariness, age, growing cold, hardening – as a wisdom of that instinct which the animals have before death – they go off alone, become silent, choose solitude, crawl into caves, become &lt;em&gt;wise&lt;/em&gt;&amp;hellip;What? Wisdom as a hiding place in which the philosopher hides himself from – spirit?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;—We free spirits—we are the first to have the necessary prerequisite to understanding what nineteen centuries have misunderstood—that instinct and passion for integrity which makes war upon the “holy lie” even more than upon all other lies&amp;hellip;. Mankind was unspeakably far from our benevolent and cautious neutrality, from that discipline of the spirit which alone makes possible the solution of such strange and subtle things: what men always sought, with shameless egoism, was their &lt;em&gt;own&lt;/em&gt; advantage therein; they created the &lt;em&gt;church&lt;/em&gt; out of denial of the Gospels&amp;hellip;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Last words.&lt;/em&gt; – One will recall that the emperor Augustus, that frightful man who had as much self-control and who could be as silent as any wise Socrates, became indiscreet against himself with his last words: he let his mask fall for the first time when he made it clear that he had worn a mask and acted a comedy – he had played the father of the fatherland and the wisdom on the throne well enough to create the proper illusion! *Plaudite amici, comoedia finita est!*21 The thought of the dying Nero – *qualis artifex pereo!*22 – was also the thought of the dying Augustus: actor’s vanity! Actor’s prolixity! And truly the opposite of the dying Socrates!23 But Tiberius died silently, this most tormented of all self-tormentors – &lt;em&gt;he&lt;/em&gt; was genuine and no actor! What might have passed through his mind at the end? Maybe this: ‘Life – that is a long death. What a fool I was to shorten so many lives! Was &lt;em&gt;I&lt;/em&gt; made to be a benefactor? I should have given them eternal &lt;em&gt;life:&lt;/em&gt; that way, I could have &lt;em&gt;seen them die&lt;/em&gt; forever. &lt;em&gt;That’s&lt;/em&gt; why I had such good eyes: *qualis spectator pereo!’*24 When after a long death-struggle he seemed to recover his strength, it was considered advisable to smother him with pillows – he died a double death.25&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Two kinds of causes that are often confused.&lt;/em&gt; – This seems to me to be one of my most essential steps forward: I learned to distinguish the cause of acting from the cause of acting in a certain way, in a certain direction, with a certain goal. The first kind of cause is a quantum of dammed-up energy waiting to be used somehow, for something; the second kind, by contrast, is something quite insignificant, mostly a small accident in accordance with which this quantum ‘discharges’ itself in one particular way: the match versus the powder keg. Among these small accidents and matches I consider all so-called ‘purposes’ as well as the even more so-called ‘vocations’: they are relatively random, arbitrary, nearly indifferent in relation to the enormous force of energy that presses on, as I said, to be used up somehow. The usual view is different: one is used to seeing the &lt;em&gt;driving&lt;/em&gt; force precisely in the goals (purposes, professions, etc.), in keeping with a very ancient error; but it is only the &lt;em&gt;directing&lt;/em&gt; force – one has mistaken the helmsman for the stream. And not even always the helmsman, the directing force&amp;hellip;Is the ‘goal’, the ‘purpose’, not often enough a beautifying pretext, a self-deception of vanity after the fact that does not want to acknowledge that the ship is &lt;em&gt;following&lt;/em&gt; the current into which it has entered accidentally? That it ‘wills’ to go that way &lt;em&gt;because it – must?&lt;/em&gt; That it certainly has a direction but – no helmsman whatsoever? We still need a critique of the concept of ‘purpose’.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;On the problem of the actor.&lt;/em&gt; – The problem of the actor has troubled me for a very long time; I was unsure (and still sometimes am) whether it is only from this angle that one can approach the dangerous concept of the ‘artist’ – a concept that has heretofore been treated with unpardonable generosity. Falseness with a good conscience; the delight in pretence erupting as a power that pushes aside, floods, and at times extinguishes one’s so-called ‘character’; the inner longing for a role and mask, for an &lt;em&gt;appearance (Schein);&lt;/em&gt; an excess of capacities for all kinds of adaptation that can no longer be satisfied in the service of the nearest, most narrowly construed utility – perhaps all of this is distinctive not &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; of the actor? Such an instinct will have developed most easily in lower-class families who had to survive under fluctuating pressures and coercions, in deep dependency; who had nimbly to cut their coats according to their cloth, always readapting to new circumstances, always having to act and pose differently until they slowly learned to turn their coats with &lt;em&gt;every&lt;/em&gt; wind and thus almost turned into coats themselves – and masters of an art which they have fully assimilated so that it is an integral part of themselves, that art of perpetually playing at self-concealment which in animals we call mimicry – until finally this capacity, accumulated from generation to generation, becomes domineering, unreasonable, intractable, an instinct that learns to command other instincts and produces the actor, the ‘artist’ (the buffoon, the teller of lies, the fool, the jester, the clown primarily, but also the classical servant, Gil Blas;34 for it is in such types that we find the prehistory of the artist and often enough even of ‘genius’). In more elevated social conditions, too, a similar human type develops under similar pressures; only here, the histrionic instinct is usually just barely kept in check by another instinct, as in the case of ‘diplomats’. Incidentally, I would think that a good diplomat would be free at any time to become a good actor – provided, of course, that he were ‘free’ to do this. But as for the &lt;em&gt;Jews,&lt;/em&gt; that people possessing the art of adaptability par excellence, one might, according to this train of thought, immediately see in them a world-historical organization for the cultivation of actors, a veritable breeding ground for actors; and indeed it is really high time to ask: what good actor today is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; – a Jew? Also the Jew as a born literary man, as the true master of the European press, exercises this power by virtue of his histrionic ability, for the literary man is essentially an actor: he plays the ‘expert’, the ‘specialist’. Finally, &lt;em&gt;women:&lt;/em&gt; consider the whole history of women – &lt;em&gt;mustn’t&lt;/em&gt; they be actresses first and foremost? Listen to doctors who have hypnotized womenfolk; finally, love them – let yourself be ‘hypnotized’ by them! What is always the result? That they try to be ‘taken for something’ even when they are being taken&amp;hellip; Woman is so artistic&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Our faith in the masculinization of Europe.&lt;/em&gt; – We owe it to Napoleon (and not at all to the French Revolution, which aimed at the ‘brotherhood’ of peoples and a general, blooming exchange of hearts) that a few warlike centuries, incomparable to any other in history, are likely to follow in succession – in short, that we have entered the &lt;em&gt;classic age of war,&lt;/em&gt; of sophisticated yet popular war on the largest scale (in terms of weapons, talents, discipline); all coming ages will look back on this kind of war with envy and deep respect as something perfect, for the national movement out of which this war glory is growing is merely the countershock against Napoleon and would not exist without Napoleon. He should be credited one day for having enabled &lt;em&gt;man&lt;/em&gt; in Europe to become the master over the businessman and the philistine – perhaps even over ‘woman’, who has been spoiled by Christianity and the enthusiastic spirit of the eighteenth century, and even more by ‘modern ideas’. Napoleon, who saw something of a personal enemy in modern ideas and in civilization itself,35 proved through this enmity to be one of the greatest continuators of the Renaissance: he brought back a whole piece, a block of granite, perhaps the decisive one, of antiquity’s essence. And who knows whether this piece of antiquity’s essence will finally again become master of the national movement, and whether it must not make itself the heir and protractor in an &lt;em&gt;affirmative&lt;/em&gt; sense of Napoleon – who wanted one Europe, as is known, and wanted it as &lt;em&gt;mistress of the earth.&lt;/em&gt; –&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;How each sex has its own prejudice about love.&lt;/em&gt; – Despite all the concessions I am willing to make to the prejudice favouring monogamy, I will never admit talk of &lt;em&gt;equal&lt;/em&gt; rights for man and woman in love: there are none. For man and woman have different conceptions of love – and it belongs to the conditions of love in each sex that &lt;em&gt;neither&lt;/em&gt; presupposes the same feeling, the same concept of ‘love’ in the other. What woman means by love is clear enough: total devotion (and not mere surrender) with soul and body, without any consideration or reserve, rather with shame and horror at the thought of a devotion that might be tied to special clauses or conditions. In this absence of conditions her love is a &lt;em&gt;faith:&lt;/em&gt; woman has no other. Man, when he loves a woman, &lt;em&gt;wants&lt;/em&gt; precisely this love from her and is thus himself as far as can be from the presupposition of female love; supposing, however, that there should also be men to whom the desire for complete surrender is not alien, well, then they are – not men. A man who loves like a woman becomes a slave, but a woman who loves like a woman becomes a &lt;em&gt;more perfect&lt;/em&gt; woman&amp;hellip; The passion of a woman, in its unconditional renunciation of her own rights, presupposes precisely that on the other side there is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; an equal pathos, not an equal will to renunciation; for if both should renounce themselves from love, the result would be – well, I don’t know, maybe an empty space? Woman wants to be taken, adopted as a possession, wants to be absorbed in the concept ‘possession’, ‘possessed’; consequently, she wants someone who &lt;em&gt;takes,&lt;/em&gt; who does not himself give or give himself away; who on the contrary is supposed precisely to be made richer in ‘himself’ – through the increase in strength, happiness, and faith given him by the woman who gives herself. Woman gives herself away; man takes more – I do not believe one can get around this natural opposition through any social contracts or with the best will to justice, desirable as it may be not to remind oneself constantly how harsh, terrible, enigmatic, and immoral this antagonism is. For love, when one considers it in its perfect, fully developed state, is nature, and nature is eternally ‘immoral’. Faithfulness is then implicit in woman’s love, and follows from its definition; in a man’s case it &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; perhaps arise as a consequence of his love, for instance as gratitude or as an idiosyncrasy of taste, a so-called ‘elective affinity’, but it does not belong to the &lt;em&gt;essence&lt;/em&gt; of his love. Indeed this is so little the case that one might almost speak with some justification of a natural back-and-forth between love and faithfulness in a man: his love is desire for possession and &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; a renunciation or giving away, but with &lt;em&gt;possession&lt;/em&gt; desire for possession always ceases&amp;hellip; In fact it is the highly refined and suspicious thirst for possession on the part of a man who rarely and only after a long time admits that he has ‘possession’, which allows his love to endure. Thus it is possible that his love continues to grow even after surrender – he will not easily admit that a woman has nothing more to ‘give up’ to him.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The hermit speaks.&lt;/em&gt; – The art of dealing with people depends essentially on the skill (requiring much practice) to accept and eat a meal prepared in a kitchen you don’t trust. If you come to the table ravenous, all is easy (‘the worst company makes itself &lt;em&gt;felt&lt;/em&gt;’ – as Mephistopheles says);36 but one is never that hungry when one needs to be! Oh, how hard it is to digest one’s fellow men! First principle: as in the face of misfortune, to engage your courage, to spring boldly to action, to admire yourself in the process, to sink your teeth into your reluctance, to swallow your disgust. Second principle: to ‘improve’ your fellow man, e.g. by praising him so as to make him start sweating out his pleasure in himself, or by taking hold of a corner of his good or ‘interesting’ qualities and pulling at it until all the virtue comes out and you can hide your fellow man in its folds. Third principle: self-hypnosis. To fixate on your object of association as if on a glass button until you stop feeling pleasure and displeasure in this activity and fall asleep without noticing it, become rigid, and attain equanimity: a home remedy amply tested in marriage and friendship, praised as indispensable but not yet scientifically analysed. Its popular name is – patience.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The hermit speaks again.&lt;/em&gt; – We, too, deal with ‘people’; we, too, modestly don the cloak in which (&lt;em&gt;as&lt;/em&gt; which) others know us, respect us, seek us, and so we appear in company, i.e. among others who are disguised but don’t want to admit it. Like all clever masks we, too, politely prop up a chair against the door when confronted with curiosity about anything but our ‘cloak’. But there are other ways and tricks for ‘wandering amongst’, for ‘associating with’, people: for instance, as a ghost – which is highly advisable if one desires to get rid of them quickly and make them afraid. Example: others reach for us and can’t get a hold of us. That’s frightening. Or we enter through a closed door. Or when all the lights are out. Or when we’re already dead. The latter is the trick of &lt;em&gt;posthumous&lt;/em&gt; people par excellence. (‘And what were you thinking?’ one of them once said impatiently; ‘Would we wish to endure this estrangement, coldness, and sepulchral silence enveloping us, this entire subterranean, hidden, mute, undiscovered loneliness that we call life but might as well be called death unless we knew what will &lt;em&gt;become&lt;/em&gt; of us and that it is only after death that we come into &lt;em&gt;our&lt;/em&gt; life and become alive oh, very much alive, we posthumous ones!’)&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Faced with a scholarly book.&lt;/em&gt; – We are not among those who have ideas only between books, stimulated by books – our habit is to think outdoors, walking, jumping, climbing, dancing, preferably on lonely mountains or right by the sea where even the paths become thoughtful. Our first question about the value of a book, a person, or a piece of music is: ‘Can they walk?’ Even more, ‘Can they dance?’ We rarely read; but are none the worse on that account – and oh, how quickly we guess how someone has come to his ideas; whether seated before the inkwell, stomach clenched, head bowed over the paper; and oh, how soon we’re done with his book! Cramped intestines betray themselves – you can bet on it – no less than stuffy air, closed ceilings, cramped spaces. – Those were my feelings just now as I closed a decent, scholarly book – grateful, very grateful, but also relieved&amp;hellip; In a scholar’s book there is nearly always something oppressive, oppressed: the ‘specialist’ emerges somehow – his eagerness, his seriousness, his ire, his overestimation of the nook in which he sits and spins, his hunchback – every specialist has his hump. Every scholarly book also reflects a soul that has become crooked; every craft makes crooked. Look at the friends of your youth again, after they have taken possession of their speciality (&lt;em&gt;Wissenschaft&lt;/em&gt;) Alas, in every case the reverse has also taken place! How they are now for all time possessed and obsessed by it! Grown into their corner, squashed beyond recognition, unfree, unstable, completely emaciated and jagged except for one spot that is paradigmatically round – one is moved and silenced when one sees them again that way. Above every craft, even one with a golden floor, is also a leaden ceiling that presses and presses on the soul until it becomes strangely and crookedly pressed. There is nothing to do about this. Don’t think you can evade such crippling through some educational artifice. One pays dearly for any kind of &lt;em&gt;mastery&lt;/em&gt; on earth, where perhaps one pays too dearly for everything; one is master of one’s trade at the price of also being its victim. But you want things to be different – ‘cheaper’, above all more comfortable – not so, my dear contemporaries? Well, if so, you instantly get something different: instead of the craftsman and master, you get the man of letters, the dexterous, ‘polydexterous’ literary man who of course lacks the hunched back – notwithstanding the posture he assumes before you as the shop attendant of spirit and the ‘bearer’ of culture – the literary man of letters, who really &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; nothing but who ‘represents’ nearly everything, who acts and ‘stands in for’ the expert, who takes it upon himself in all modesty to &lt;em&gt;make&lt;/em&gt; himself paid, honoured, and celebrated in place of the expert. No, my scholarly friends, I bless you even for your hunched backs! And for despising, as do I, the ‘literary men’ and culture parasites! And for not knowing how to make a business of the spirit! And for having opinions that cannot be translated into monetary terms! And for not representing anything that you are &lt;em&gt;not!&lt;/em&gt; And because your only desire (&lt;em&gt;Wille&lt;/em&gt;) is to become masters of your craft, with reverence for every type of mastery and competence and with ruthless rejection of anything specious, semi-genuine, meretricious, virtuoso-like, demagogical, or histrionic &lt;em&gt;in litteris et artibus37&lt;/em&gt; – of anything that cannot give you proof of its unconditional &lt;em&gt;probity&lt;/em&gt; in discipline and prior training. (Not even genius can compensate for such a deficiency, however much it may blind people to it. One grasps this once one has watched our most talented painters and musicians up close, who nearly without exception manage through a cunning inventiveness of manners, stop-gap devices, and even principles, to acquire artificially and belatedly the &lt;em&gt;appearance&lt;/em&gt; of such probity, such solidity of schooling and culture – without, of course, managing to deceive themselves, to silence forever their bad conscience. For surely you know? All great contemporary artists suffer from a bad conscience&amp;hellip;)&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The first distinction to draw regarding artworks.&lt;/em&gt; – Everything that is thought, written, painted, composed, even built and sculpted, belongs either to monologue art or to art before witnesses. The second category must also include the seemingly monologue art involving faith in God, the entire lyricism of prayer; for solitude does not yet exist to the pious – this invention was first made by us, the godless. I know no deeper distinction in an artist’s entire optics than this: whether he views his budding artwork (‘himself’) from the eye of the witness, or whether he ‘has forgotten the world’, which is the essential feature of all monologue art – it is based &lt;em&gt;on forgetting;&lt;/em&gt; it is the music of forgetting.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The cynic speaks.&lt;/em&gt; – My objections to Wagner’s music are physiological objections: why disguise them with aesthetic formulas? My ‘fact’ is that I stop breathing easily once this music starts affecting me; that my &lt;em&gt;foot&lt;/em&gt; immediately gets angry at it and revolts – it has a need for tempo, dance, march; it demands chiefly from music the raptures found in &lt;em&gt;good&lt;/em&gt; walking, striding, leaping, and dancing – but doesn’t my stomach protest, too? My heart? My circulation? My intestines? Do I not unnoticeably grow hoarse as I listen? And so I ask myself: what does my whole body actually &lt;em&gt;want&lt;/em&gt; from music? Its own &lt;em&gt;relief,&lt;/em&gt; I believe, as if all animal functions should be quickened by easy, bold, exuberant, self-assured rhythms; as if iron, leaden life should be gilded by golden, good, tender harmonies. My melancholy wants to rest in the hiding-places and abysses of &lt;em&gt;perfection:&lt;/em&gt; that’s what I need music for. &amp;ldquo;What is the drama to me! The cramps of its moral ecstasies that give the ‘people’ satisfaction! The whole hocus-pocus of gestures of the actor! You will guess that I am essentially anti-theatrical – but Wagner was, conversely, essentially a man of the theatre and an actor, the most enthusiastic mimomaniac that ever existed, also as a musician. And, incidentally, if it was Wagner’s theory that ‘the drama is the end; the music is always merely its means’,38 his &lt;em&gt;practice&lt;/em&gt; was always, from beginning to end, ‘the attitude is the end; the drama, and music, too, is always merely &lt;em&gt;its&lt;/em&gt; means’. Music as a means of clarification, strengthening, internalization of the dramatic gesture and the actor’s appeal to the senses; and the Wagnerian drama a mere occasion for many dramatic attitudes! Beside all other instincts, he had the commanding instinct of a great actor in absolutely everything – and, as I said, also as a musician. I once made this clear to an upright Wagnerian, with some trouble; and I had reasons to add: ‘Do be a bit more honest with yourself – after all, we’re not at the theatre! At the theatre, one is honest only as a mass; as an individual one lies, lies to oneself. One leaves oneself at home when one goes to the theatre; one relinquishes the right to one’s own tongue and choice, to one’s taste, even to one’s courage as one has it and exercises it within one’s own four walls against god and man. No one brings the finest senses of his art to the theatre; nor does the artist who works for the theatre: there, one is people, public, herd, woman, pharisee, voting cattle, democrat, neighbour, fellow man; there, even the most personal conscience is vanquished by the levelling magic of the “greatest number”; there, stupidity breeds lasciviousness and is contagious; there, the “neighbour” reigns; there, one &lt;em&gt;becomes&lt;/em&gt; a neighbour’. (I forgot to mention my enlightened Wagnerian’s retort to the physiological objections: ‘So, you simply aren’t healthy enough for our music?’)&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Our coexistence.&lt;/em&gt; – Don’t we have to admit to ourselves, we artists, that there exists an uncanny disparity within us; that in an odd way our taste and on the other hand our creative power stand each distinct from the other; each remains the way it is by itself, and each grows by itself; I mean each of these has completely different degrees and &lt;em&gt;tempi&lt;/em&gt; of old, young, ripe, overblown, rotten? A musician, for instance, could spend a lifetime creating things that &lt;em&gt;contradict&lt;/em&gt; what his spoiled listener’s ear, listener’s heart values, savours, prefers – he needn’t even be aware of this contradiction! As experience shows with almost embarrassing regularity, one’s taste can easily outgrow the taste of one’s powers, even without thereby paralysing them and hindering their continued productivity. But the opposite can happen, too – and this is precisely what I’d like to call artists’ attention to. A perpetually creative person, a ‘mother’ type in the grand sense of the term, someone who doesn’t hear or know anything but the pregnancies and child-beds of his spirit anymore, who simply has no time to reflect on himself and on his work and to make comparisons, who no longer wants to exercise his taste and simply forgets it, i.e. lets it stand, lie, or fall – maybe such a person would finally produce works &lt;em&gt;that far excel his own judgement,&lt;/em&gt; so that he utters inanities about them and himself – utters them and believes them. This seems to me to be almost the norm among fertile artists – nobody knows a child less well than his parents – and this is true, to take a colossal example, even in the case of the whole world of Greek art and poetry: it never ‘knew’ what it had done.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;—Our age is proud of its historical sense: how, then, could it delude itself into believing that the &lt;em&gt;crude fable of the wonder-worker and Saviour&lt;/em&gt; constituted the beginnings of Christianity—and that everything spiritual and symbolical in it only came later? Quite to the contrary, the whole history of Christianity—from the death on the cross onward—is the history of a progressively clumsier misunderstanding of an &lt;em&gt;original&lt;/em&gt; symbolism. With every extension of Christianity among larger and ruder masses, even less capable of grasping the principles that gave birth to it, the need arose to make it more and more &lt;em&gt;vulgar&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;barbarous&lt;/em&gt;—it absorbed the teachings and rites of all the &lt;em&gt;subterranean&lt;/em&gt; cults of the &lt;em&gt;imperium Romanum&lt;/em&gt;, and the absurdities engendered by all sorts of sickly reasoning. It was the fate of Christianity that its faith had to become as sickly, as low and as vulgar as the needs were sickly, low and vulgar to which it had to administer. A &lt;em&gt;sickly barbarism&lt;/em&gt; finally lifts itself to power as the church—the church, that incarnation of deadly hostility to all honesty, to all loftiness of soul, to all discipline of the spirit, to all spontaneous and kindly humanity.—&lt;em&gt;Christian&lt;/em&gt; values—&lt;em&gt;noble&lt;/em&gt; values: it is only we, we &lt;em&gt;free&lt;/em&gt; spirits, who have re-established this greatest of all antitheses in values!&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Because of three errors.&lt;/em&gt; – One has promoted science during the last centuries partly because it was through science that one hoped best to understand God’s goodness and wisdom – the main motive in the soul of the great Englishmen (such as Newton);26 partly because one believed in the absolute usefulness of knowledge, especially in the most intimate affiliation between morality, knowledge, and happiness – the main motive in the soul of the French (such as Voltaire);27 and partly because one believed that in science one had and loved something selfless, harmless, self-sufficient, and truly innocent in which the evil drives of humanity had no part at all – the main motive in the soul of Spinoza,28who felt divine in attaining knowledge – in sum, because of three errors.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;What is romanticism?&lt;/em&gt; – It may be recalled, at least among my friends, that initially I approached the modern world with a few crude errors and over-estimations and, in any case, with hope. I understood – on the basis of who knows what personal experiences? – the philosophical pessimism of the nineteenth century as if it were a symptom of a higher force of thought, of more audacious courage, and of more victorious &lt;em&gt;fullness&lt;/em&gt; of life than had characterized the eighteenth century, the age of Hume, Kant, Condillac,39 and the sensualists: thus, tragic insight struck me as the distinctive &lt;em&gt;luxury&lt;/em&gt; of our culture, its most precious, noblest and most dangerous squandering; but still, in view of its over-richness, as its &lt;em&gt;permitted&lt;/em&gt; luxury. Similarly, I explained German music to myself as the expression of a Dionysian might of the German soul: I believed I heard in it the earthquake through which some pent-up primordial force is finally released – indifferent about whether it sets everything else which is called culture atremble.40 You see that what I misjudged both in philosophical pessimism and in German music was what constitutes its actual character – its &lt;em&gt;romanticism.&lt;/em&gt; What is romanticism? Every art, every philosophy can be considered a cure and aid in the service of growing, struggling life: they always presuppose suffering and sufferers. But there are two types of sufferers: first, those who suffer from a &lt;em&gt;superabundance of life&lt;/em&gt; – they want a Dionysian art as well as a tragic outlook and insight into life; then, those who suffer from an &lt;em&gt;impoverishment of life&lt;/em&gt; and seek quiet, stillness, calm seas, redemption from themselves through art and insight, or else intoxication, paroxysm, numbness, madness. All romanticism in art and in knowledge fits the dual needs of the latter type, as did (and do) Schopenhauer and Richard Wagner, to name the most famous and prominent romantics that I &lt;em&gt;misunderstood&lt;/em&gt; at the time – &lt;em&gt;not,&lt;/em&gt; incidentally, to their disadvantage, one might in all fairness concede. He who is richest in fullness of life, the Dionysian god and man, can allow himself not only the sight of what is terrible and questionable but also the terrible deed and every luxury of destruction, decomposition, negation; in his case, what is evil, nonsensical, and ugly almost seems acceptable because of an overflow in procreating, fertilizing forces capable of turning any desert into bountiful farmland. Conversely, he who suffers most and is poorest in life would need mainly mildness, peacefulness, goodness in thought and in deed – if possible, also a god who truly would be a god for the sick, a ‘saviour’; as well as logic, the conceptual comprehensibility of existence – for logic soothes, gives confidence – in short, a certain warm, fear-repelling narrowness and confinement to optimistic horizons. Thus I gradually came to understand Epicurus, the antithesis of a Dionysian pessimist, and equally the ‘Christian’, who really is simply a kind of Epicurean and, like him, essentially a romantic; and my vision grew keener for that most difficult and insidious form of &lt;em&gt;backward inference&lt;/em&gt; with which the most mistakes are made – the inference from the work to the maker, from the ideal to the one who &lt;em&gt;needs it,&lt;/em&gt; from every manner of valuation to the commanding &lt;em&gt;need&lt;/em&gt; behind it. Nowadays I avail myself of this primary distinction concerning all aesthetic values: in every case I ask, ‘Is it hunger or superabundance that have become creative here?’ At first glance, a different distinction may appear more advisable – it’s far more noticeable – namely, the question of whether the creation was caused by a desire for fixing, for immortalizing, for &lt;em&gt;being,&lt;/em&gt; or rather by a desire for destruction, for change, for novelty, for future, for &lt;em&gt;becoming.&lt;/em&gt; However, both types of desires prove ambiguous upon closer examination, and can be interpreted under the first scheme, which seems preferable to me. The desire for &lt;em&gt;destruction,&lt;/em&gt; for change and for becoming can be the expression of an overflowing energy pregnant with the future (my term for this is, as is known, ‘Dionysian’); but it can also be the hatred of the ill-constituted, deprived, and underprivileged one who destroys and &lt;em&gt;must&lt;/em&gt; destroy because what exists, indeed all existence, all being, outrages and provokes him. To understand this feeling, take a close look at our anarchists. The will to &lt;em&gt;immortalize&lt;/em&gt; also requires a dual interpretation. It can be prompted, first, by gratitude and love; art of such origin will always be an art of apotheosis, dithyrambic perhaps like Rubens;41 blissfully mocking like Hafis;42 bright and gracious like Goethe, spreading a Homeric light and splendour over all things. But it can also be the tyrannical will of someone who suffers deeply, who struggles, is tortured, and who would like to stamp as a binding law and compulsion what is most personal, singular, narrow, the real idiosyncrasy of his suffering, and who as it were takes revenge on all things by forcing, imprinting, branding &lt;em&gt;his&lt;/em&gt; image on them, the image of &lt;em&gt;his&lt;/em&gt; torture. The latter is &lt;em&gt;romantic pessimism&lt;/em&gt; in its most expressive form, be it Schopenhauer’s philosophy of will or Wagner’s music – romantic pessimism, the last &lt;em&gt;great&lt;/em&gt; event in the fate of our culture. (That there &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; be a completely different pessimism, a classical one – this intuition and vision belongs to me as inseparable from me, as my &lt;em&gt;proprium&lt;/em&gt;43 and &lt;em&gt;ipsissimum;44&lt;/em&gt; only the word ‘classical’ offends my ears; it has become far too trite, round, and indistinct. I call this pessimism of the future – for it is coming! I see it coming! – &lt;em&gt;Dionysian&lt;/em&gt; pessimism.)&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;We incomprehensible ones.&lt;/em&gt; – Have we ever complained about being misunderstood, misjudged, misidentified, defamed, misheard, and ignored? This is precisely our lot – oh, for a long time yet! Let’s say until 1901, to be modest – this is also our distinction; we wouldn’t honour ourselves enough if we wanted it otherwise. We are misidentified – for we ourselves keep growing, changing, shedding old hides; we still shed our skins every spring; we become increasingly younger, more future-oriented, taller, stronger; we drive our roots ever more powerfully into the depths – into evil – while at the same time embracing the heavens ever more lovingly and broadly, and absorbing their light ever more thirstily with all our sprigs and leaves. Like trees we grow – it’s hard to understand, like all life! – not in one place, but everywhere; not in one direction, but upwards and outwards and inwards and downwards equally; our energy drives trunk, branches, and roots all at once; we are no longer free to do anything individual, to &lt;em&gt;be&lt;/em&gt; anything individual&amp;hellip; This is our lot, as I have said: we grow in &lt;em&gt;height;&lt;/em&gt; and even if this should be our dark fate – for we dwell ever closer to the lightning! – well, we do not honour it less on that account; it remains that which we do not want to share, to impart: the dark fate of height, &lt;em&gt;our&lt;/em&gt; fate.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Why we are not idealists.&lt;/em&gt; – Formerly, philosophers feared the senses: is it possible that we have unlearned this fear all too much? Today we are all sensualists, we philosophers of the present and future, &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; in theory but in &lt;em&gt;praxis,&lt;/em&gt; in practice.45 The former, however, saw the senses as trying to lure them away from &lt;em&gt;their&lt;/em&gt; world, from the cold kingdom of ‘ideas’, to a dangerous Southern isle where they feared their philosophers’ virtues would melt away like snow in the sun. ‘Wax in the ear’ was virtually a condition of philosophizing; a true philosopher didn’t listen to life insofar as life is music; he &lt;em&gt;denied&lt;/em&gt; the music of life – it is an old philosopher’s superstition that all music is siren-music.46 Today we are inclined to make the opposite judgement (which could itself be just as mistaken), namely, that &lt;em&gt;ideas&lt;/em&gt; are worse seductresses than the senses, for all their cold, anaemic appearance and not even despite that appearance – they always lived off the ‘blood’ of the philosopher; they always drained his senses and even, if you believe it, his ‘heart’. These old philosophers were heartless: philosophizing was always a kind of vampirism. When considering such figures, including even Spinoza, don’t you feel something deeply enigmatic and strange? Don’t you see the spectacle unfolding, this steady &lt;em&gt;growing paler&lt;/em&gt; – this ever more ideally construed desensualization? Don’t you sense in the background some long-concealed blood-sucker who starts with the senses and finally leaves behind and spares only bones and rattling? – I refer to categories, formulas, &lt;em&gt;words&lt;/em&gt; (for, forgive me, what &lt;em&gt;remained&lt;/em&gt; of Spinoza, &lt;em&gt;amor intellectualis dei,47&lt;/em&gt; is mere rattle, nothing more! What is &lt;em&gt;amor;&lt;/em&gt; what &lt;em&gt;deus,&lt;/em&gt; when they are missing every drop of blood?). In sum: all philosophical idealism until now was something like an illness, except where, as in Plato’s case, it was the caution of an overabundant and dangerous health; the fear of &lt;em&gt;overpowerful&lt;/em&gt; senses; the shrewdness of a shrewd Socratic. – Maybe we moderns are not healthy enough &lt;em&gt;to need&lt;/em&gt; Plato’s idealism? And we don’t fear the senses because –&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;‘Science’ as prejudice.&lt;/em&gt; – It follows from the laws that govern rank-ordering (&lt;em&gt;Rangordnung&lt;/em&gt;) that scholars, insofar as they belong to the intellectual middle class, are not even allowed to catch sight of the truly &lt;em&gt;great&lt;/em&gt; problems and question marks; moreover, their courage and eyes simply don’t reach that far – and above all, the need that makes them scholars, their inner expectations and wish that things might be &lt;em&gt;such and such,&lt;/em&gt; their fear and hope, too soon find rest and satisfaction. What makes, for instance, the pedantic Englishman Herbert Spencer48 rave in his own way and makes him draw a line of hope, a horizon which defines what is desirable; that definitive reconciliation of ‘egoism and altruism’ about which he spins fables – this almost nauseates the likes of us: a human race that adopts as its ultimate perspective such a Spencerian perspective would strike us as deserving of contempt, of annihilation! But &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; he had to view as his highest hope what to others counts and should count only as a disgusting possibility is a question mark that Spencer would have been unable to foresee. So, too, it is with the faith with which so many materialistic natural scientists rest content: the faith in a world that is supposed to have its equivalent and measure in human thought, in human valuations – a ‘world of truth’ that can be grasped entirely with the help of our four-cornered little human reason – What? Do we really want to demote existence in this way to an exercise in arithmetic and an indoor diversion for mathematicians? Above all, one shouldn’t want to strip it of its &lt;em&gt;ambiguous&lt;/em&gt; character: that, gentlemen, is what &lt;em&gt;good&lt;/em&gt; taste demands – above all, the taste of reverence for everything that lies beyond your horizon! That the only rightful interpretation of the world should be one to which &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt; have a right; one by which one can do research and go on scientifically in &lt;em&gt;your&lt;/em&gt; sense of the term (you really mean &lt;em&gt;mechanistically?&lt;/em&gt;) – one that permits counting, calculating, weighing, seeing, grasping, and nothing else – that is a crudity and naiveté, assuming it is not a mental illness, an idiocy. Would it not be quite probable, conversely, that precisely the most superficial and external aspect of existence – what is most apparent; its skin and its sensualization – would be grasped first and might even be the only thing that let itself be grasped? Thus, a ‘scientific’ interpretation of the world, as you understand it, might still be one of the &lt;em&gt;stupidest&lt;/em&gt; of all possible interpretations of the world, i.e. one of those most lacking in significance. This to the ear and conscience of Mr Mechanic, who nowadays likes to pass as a philosopher and insists that mechanics is the doctrine of the first and final laws on which existence may be built, as on a ground floor. But an essentially mechanistic world would be an essentially &lt;em&gt;meaningless&lt;/em&gt; world! Suppose one judged the &lt;em&gt;value&lt;/em&gt; of a piece of music according to how much of it could be counted, calculated, and expressed in formulas – how absurd such a ‘scientific’ evaluation of music would be! What would one have comprehended, understood, recognized? Nothing, really nothing of what is ‘music’ in it!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Our new ‘infinite’.&lt;/em&gt; – How far the perspectival character of existence extends, or indeed whether it has any other character; whether an existence without interpretation, without ‘sense’, doesn’t become ‘nonsense’; whether, on the other hand, all existence isn’t essentially an &lt;em&gt;interpreting&lt;/em&gt; existence – that cannot, as would be fair, be decided even by the most industrious and extremely conscientious analysis and self-examination of the intellect; for in the course of this analysis, the human intellect cannot avoid seeing itself under its perspectival forms, and &lt;em&gt;solely&lt;/em&gt; in these. We cannot look around our corner: it is a hopeless curiosity to want to know what other kinds of intellects and perspectives there &lt;em&gt;might&lt;/em&gt; be; e.g. whether other beings might be able to experience time backwards, or alternately forwards and backwards (which would involve another direction of life and a different conception of cause and effect). But I think that today we are at least far away from the ridiculous immodesty of decreeing from our angle that perspectives are &lt;em&gt;permitted&lt;/em&gt; only from this angle. Rather, the world has once again become infinite to us: in so far as we cannot reject the possibility &lt;em&gt;that it includes infinite interpretations.&lt;/em&gt; Once again the great shudder seizes us – but who again would want immediately to deify in the old manner &lt;em&gt;this&lt;/em&gt; monster of an unknown world? And to worship from this time on the unknown (&lt;em&gt;das Unbekannte&lt;/em&gt;) as ‘the Unknown One’ (&lt;em&gt;den Unbekannten)?&lt;/em&gt; Alas, too many &lt;em&gt;ungodly&lt;/em&gt; possibilities of interpretation are included in this unknown; too much devilry, stupidity, foolishness of interpretation – our own human, all too human one, even, which we know&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Why we seem to be Epicureans.&lt;/em&gt; – We are cautious, we modern men, about ultimate convictions; our mistrust lies in wait for the enchantments and deceptions of the conscience involved in every strong faith, every unconditional Yes and No. How can this be explained? Maybe what is to be found here is largely the caution of ‘once bitten, twice shy’; of the disappointed idealist; but there is also another, superior component: the gleeful curiosity of the one who used to stand in the corner and was driven to despair by his corner and who now delights and luxuriates in the opposite of a corner, in the boundless, in ‘the free as such’. Thus an almost Epicurean bent of knowledge develops that will not easily let go of the questionable character of things; also an aversion to big moral words and gestures; a taste that rejects all crude, four-square oppositions and is proudly aware of its practice in entertaining doubts. For &lt;em&gt;this&lt;/em&gt; constitutes our pride, this slight tightening of the reins as our urge for certainty races ahead, this self-control of the rider on his wildest rides – for we still ride spirited and fiery animals; and when we hesitate, it is danger least of all that makes us hesitate.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Our slow periods.&lt;/em&gt; – This is how all artists and people of ‘works’ feel, the motherly type: at every chapter of their lives – which is always marked by a work – they always think they’ve reached their goal; they would always patiently take death with the feeling ‘we are ripe for it’. This is not the expression of weariness – rather that of a certain autumnal sunniness and mildness that the work itself, the fact that the work has become ripe, always leaves behind in its creator. Then the pace of life slows down and becomes thick and flows like honey – to the point of a long &lt;em&gt;fermata&lt;/em&gt;,49 of the faith in &lt;em&gt;the&lt;/em&gt; long &lt;em&gt;fermata.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;We who are homeless.&lt;/em&gt; – Among Europeans today there is no lack of those who have a right to call themselves homeless in a distinctive and honourable sense: it is to them in particular that I commend my secret wisdom and *gaya scienza.*50 For their lot is hard; their hope uncertain; it is a feat to invent a form of comfort for them – but to what avail! We children of the future – how &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; we be at home in this today! We are unfavourably disposed towards all ideals that might make one feel at home in this fragile, broken time of transition; as for its ‘realities’, we don’t believe they are &lt;em&gt;lasting.&lt;/em&gt; The ice that still supports people today has already grown very thin; the wind that brings a thaw is blowing; we ourselves, we homeless ones, are something that breaks up the ice and other all too thin ‘realities’&amp;hellip;We ‘conserve’ nothing; neither do we want to return to any past; we are by no means ‘liberal’; we are not working for ‘progress’; we don’t need to plug our ears to the marketplace’s sirens of the future: what they sing – ‘equal rights’, ‘free society’, ‘no more masters and no servants’ – has no allure for us. We hold it absolutely undesirable that a realm of justice and concord should be established on earth (because it would certainly be the realm of the most profound levelling down to mediocrity and *chinoiserie);*51 we are delighted by all who love, as we do, danger, war, and adventure; who refuse to compromise, to be captured, to reconcile, to be castrated; we consider ourselves conquerors; we contemplate the necessity for new orders as well as for a new slavery – for every strengthening and enhancement of the human type also involves a new kind of enslavement – doesn’t it? With all this, can we really be at home in an age that loves to claim the distinction of being the most humane, the mildest, and most righteous age the sun has ever seen? It is bad enough that precisely when we hear these beautiful words, we have the ugliest misgivings. What we find in them is merely an expression – and the masquerade – of a deep weakening, of weariness, of old age, of declining energies! What can it matter to us what sequins the sick may use to cover up their weakness? Let them parade it as their &lt;em&gt;virtue;&lt;/em&gt; after all, there is no doubt that weakness makes us mild, so righteous, so inoffensive, so ‘humane’! The ‘religion of compassion’ to which one would like to convert us – oh, we know these hysterical little men and women well enough who today need just this religion as a veil and finery. We are no humanitarians; we should never dare to allow ourselves to speak of ‘our love of humanity’ – our type is not actor enough for that! Or not Saint-Simonist52 enough; not French enough. One really has to be afflicted with a &lt;em&gt;Gallic&lt;/em&gt; excess of erotic irritability and enamoured impatience to approach humanity honestly with one’s lust&amp;hellip; Humanity! Has there ever been a more hideous old woman amongst all old women? (Unless it were ‘the truth’: a question for philosophers.) No, we do not love humanity; but on the other hand we are not nearly ‘German’ enough, in the sense in which the word ‘German’ is constantly used nowadays, to advocate nationalism and racial hatred and to be able to take pleasure in the national scabies of the heart and blood poisoning with which European peoples nowadays delimit and barricade themselves against each other as if with quarantines. For that, we are too uninhibited, too malicious, too spoiled, also too well-informed, too ‘well-travelled’: we far prefer to live on mountains, apart, ‘untimely’, in past or future centuries, merely in order to avoid the silent rage to which we know we should be condemned as eyewitnesses of politics that are destroying the German spirit by making it vain and which are, moreover, &lt;em&gt;petty&lt;/em&gt; politics – to keep its creation from falling apart again, doesn’t it need to plant it between two deadly hatreds? &lt;em&gt;Mustn’t&lt;/em&gt; it desire the eternalization of the European system of many petty states? We who are homeless are too diverse and racially mixed in our descent, as ‘modern men’, and consequently we are not inclined to participate in the mendacious racial self-admiration and obscenity that parades in Germany today as a sign of a German way of thinking and that is doubly false and indecent among the people of the ‘historical sense’. In a word – and let this be our word of honour – we are &lt;em&gt;good Europeans,&lt;/em&gt; the rich heirs of millennia of European spirit, with too many provisions but also too many obligations. As such, we have also outgrown Christianity and are averse to it – precisely because we have grown &lt;em&gt;out&lt;/em&gt; of it, because our ancestors were Christians who in their Christianity were mercilessly upright: for their faith they willingly sacrificed possessions, blood, position, and fatherland. We – do the same. But for what? For our unbelief? For every kind of unbelief? No, you know better than that, my friends! The hidden Yes in you is stronger than all Nos and Maybes that afflict you and your age like a disease; and you must sail the seas, you emigrants, you too are compelled to this by – a &lt;em&gt;faith!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;‘Andbecome bright again’.&lt;/em&gt; – We who are generous and rich in spirit, who stand by the road like open wells with no intention to fend off anyone who feels like drawing from us – we unfortunately do not know how to defend ourselves where we want to: we have no way of preventing people from &lt;em&gt;clouding&lt;/em&gt; us, from darkening us; the time in which we live throws into us what is most time-bound; its dirty birds drop their filth into us; its boys their knick-knacks; and exhausted wanderers who come to us to rest, their small and great miseries. But we will do what we have always done: we take down into our depths whatever one casts into us – for we are deep; we do not forget – &lt;em&gt;and become bright again&amp;hellip;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The fool’s interlude.&lt;/em&gt; – The writer of this book is no misanthrope; today one pays too dearly for hatred of man. In order to hate the way one formerly hated &lt;em&gt;the&lt;/em&gt; human being, Timonically,53 wholly, without exception, with one’s whole heart, with the whole &lt;em&gt;love&lt;/em&gt; of hatred, one would have to renounce contempt. And how much fine joy, how much patience, how much graciousness even do we owe precisely to our contempt! Moreover, it makes us ‘God’s elect’: refined contempt is our taste and privilege, our art, our virtue perhaps, and we are the most modern of moderns&amp;hellip;Hatred, in contrast, places people on a par, vis-à-vis; in hatred there is honour; finally, in hatred there is &lt;em&gt;fear,&lt;/em&gt; an ample good piece of fear. We fearless ones, however, we more spiritual men of this age, we know our advantage well enough to live without fear of this age precisely because we are more spiritual. We will hardly be decapitated, imprisoned, or exiled; not even our books will be banned or burned. The age loves the spirit; it loves and needs us, even if we should have to make clear to it that we are artists of contempt; that every association with human beings makes us shudder slightly; that for all our mildness, patience, congeniality, and politeness, we cannot persuade our noses to give up their prejudices against the proximity of a human being; that we love nature the less humanly it behaves, and art &lt;em&gt;if it&lt;/em&gt; is the artist’s escape from man or the artist’s mockery of man, or the artist’s mockery of himself&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;—I cannot, at this place, avoid a sigh. There are days when I am visited by a feeling blacker than the blackest melancholy—&lt;em&gt;contempt of man&lt;/em&gt;. Let me leave no doubt as to &lt;em&gt;what&lt;/em&gt; I despise, &lt;em&gt;whom&lt;/em&gt; I despise: it is the man of today, the man with whom I am unhappily contemporaneous. The man of today—I am suffocated by his foul breath!&amp;hellip; Toward the past, like all who understand, I am full of tolerance, which is to say, &lt;em&gt;generous&lt;/em&gt; self-control: with gloomy caution I pass through whole millenniums of this madhouse of a world, call it “Christianity,” “Christian faith” or the “Christian church,” as you will—I take care not to hold mankind responsible for its lunacies. But my feeling changes and breaks out irresistibly the moment I enter modern times, &lt;em&gt;our&lt;/em&gt; times. Our age &lt;em&gt;knows better&lt;/em&gt;&amp;hellip;. What was formerly merely sickly now becomes indecent—it is indecent to be a Christian today. &lt;em&gt;And here my disgust begins.&lt;/em&gt;—I look about me: not a word survives of what was once called “truth”; we can no longer bear to hear a priest pronounce the word. Even a man who makes the most modest pretensions to integrity &lt;em&gt;must&lt;/em&gt; know that a theologian, a priest, a pope of today not only errs when he speaks, but actually &lt;em&gt;lies&lt;/em&gt;—and that he no longer escapes blame for his lie through “innocence” or “ignorance.” The priest knows, as every one knows, that there is no longer any “God,” or any “sinner,” or any “Saviour”—that “free will” and the “moral order of the world” are lies—: serious reflection, the profound self-conquest of the spirit, &lt;em&gt;allow&lt;/em&gt; no man to pretend that he does &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; know it&amp;hellip;. &lt;em&gt;All&lt;/em&gt; the ideas of the church are now recognized for what they are—as the worst counterfeits in existence, invented to debase nature and all natural values; the priest himself is seen as he actually is—as the most dangerous form of parasite, as the venomous spider of creation&amp;hellip;. We know, our &lt;em&gt;conscience&lt;/em&gt; now knows—just &lt;em&gt;what&lt;/em&gt; the real value of all those sinister inventions of priest and church has been and &lt;em&gt;what ends they have served&lt;/em&gt;, with their debasement of humanity to a state of self-pollution, the very sight of which excites loathing,—the concepts “the other world,” “the last judgment,” “the immortality of the soul,” the “soul” itself: they are all merely so many instruments of torture, systems of cruelty, whereby the priest becomes master and remains master&amp;hellip;. Every one knows this, &lt;em&gt;but nevertheless things remain as before&lt;/em&gt;. What has become of the last trace of decent feeling, of self-respect, when our statesmen, otherwise an unconventional class of men and thoroughly anti-Christian in their acts, now call themselves Christians and go to the communion-table?&amp;hellip; A prince at the head of his armies, magnificent as the expression of the egoism and arrogance of his people—and yet acknowledging, &lt;em&gt;without&lt;/em&gt; any shame, that he is a Christian!&amp;hellip; Whom, then, does Christianity deny? &lt;em&gt;what&lt;/em&gt; does it call “the world”? To be a &lt;em&gt;soldier&lt;/em&gt;, to be a judge, to be a patriot; to defend one’s self; to be careful of one’s honour; to desire one’s own advantage; to be &lt;em&gt;proud&lt;/em&gt; &amp;hellip; every act of everyday, every instinct, every valuation that shows itself in a &lt;em&gt;deed&lt;/em&gt;, is now anti-Christian: what a &lt;em&gt;monster of falsehood&lt;/em&gt; the modern man must be to call himself nevertheless, and &lt;em&gt;without&lt;/em&gt; shame, a Christian!—&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The explosive ones.&lt;/em&gt; – When one considers how the energy of young men needs to explode, one is not surprised to see them decide so unsubtly and so unselectively for this or that cause: what thrills them is the sight of the zeal surrounding a cause and, so to speak, the sight of the burning match – not the cause itself. The subtler seducers therefore know how to create in them the expectation of an explosion and to disregard justifying their cause: reasons are not the way to win over these powder kegs!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;‘The wanderer’ speaks.&lt;/em&gt; – In order to see our European morality for once as it looks from a distance, and to measure it up against other past or future moralities, one has to proceed like a wanderer who wants to know how high the towers in a town are: he &lt;em&gt;leaves&lt;/em&gt; the town. ‘Thoughts about moral prejudices’, if they are not to be prejudices about prejudices, presuppose a position &lt;em&gt;outside&lt;/em&gt; morality, some point beyond good and evil to which one has to rise, climb, or fly – and in the present case, at least a point beyond &lt;em&gt;our&lt;/em&gt; good and evil, a freedom from everything ‘European’, by which I mean the sum of commanding value judgements that have become part of our flesh and blood. That one &lt;em&gt;wants&lt;/em&gt; to go precisely out there, up there, may be a slight rashness, a peculiar and unreasonable ‘you must’ – for we seekers of knowledge also have our idiosyncrasies of ‘unfree will’ – the question is whether one really &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; get up there. This may depend on manifold conditions. Mainly, the question is how light or heavy we are – the problem of our ‘specific gravity’. One has to be &lt;em&gt;very light&lt;/em&gt; to drive one’s will to knowledge into such a distance and, as it were, beyond one’s time; to create for oneself eyes to survey millennia and, moreover, clear skies in these eyes. One must have liberated oneself from many things that oppress, inhibit, hold down, and make heavy precisely us Europeans today. The human being of such a beyond who wants to catch a glimpse of the highest measures of value of his time must first of all ‘overcome’ this time in himself – this is the test of his strength – and consequently not only his time but also his aversion and opposition &lt;em&gt;against&lt;/em&gt; this time, his suffering from this time, his untimeliness, his &lt;em&gt;romanticism.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;On the question of being understandable.&lt;/em&gt; – One does not only wish to be understood when one writes; one wishes just as surely &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; to be understood. It is by no means necessarily an objection to a book when anyone finds it incomprehensible: perhaps that was part of the author’s intention – he didn’t &lt;em&gt;want&lt;/em&gt; to be understood by just ‘anybody’. Every nobler spirit and taste selects his audience when he wants to communicate; in selecting it, he simultaneously erects barriers against ‘the others’. All subtler laws of a style originated therein: they simultaneously keep away, create a distance, forbid ‘entrance’, understanding, as said above – while they open the ears of those whose ears are related to ours. And let me say this amongst ourselves and about my own case: I want neither the inexperience nor the liveliness of my temperament to keep me from being understandable to &lt;em&gt;you,&lt;/em&gt; my friends – not the liveliness, as much as it forces me to deal with a matter swiftly in order to deal with it at all. For I approach deep problems such as I do cold baths: fast in, fast out. That this is no way to get to the depths, to get deep &lt;em&gt;enough,&lt;/em&gt; is the superstition of those who fear water, the enemies of cold water; they speak without experience. Oh, the great cold makes one fast! And incidentally: does a matter stay unrecognized, not understood, merely because it has been touched in flight; is only glanced at, seen in a flash? Does one absolutely have to sit firmly on it first? Have brooded on it as on an egg? *Diu noctuque incubando,*54 as Newton said of himself? At least there are truths that are especially shy and ticklish and can’t be caught except suddenly – that one must &lt;em&gt;surprise&lt;/em&gt; or leave alone. Finally, my brevity has yet another value: given the questions that occupy me, I must say many things briefly so that they will be heard even more briefly. For, as an immoralist, one needs to avoid corrupting innocents – I mean, asses and old maids of both sexes to whom life offers nothing but their innocence; even more, my writing should inspire, elevate, and encourage them to be virtuous. I can’t imagine a funnier sight on earth than inspired old asses and maids who get aroused by the sweet sentiments of virtue: and ‘this I have seen’ – thus spoke Zarathustra. Enough about brevity; things stand worse with my ignorance, which I don’t try to hide from myself. There are hours when I am ashamed of it to be sure, also hours when I am ashamed of this shame. Maybe we philosophers are all in a bad position regarding knowledge these days: science is growing, and the most scholarly of us are close to discovering that they know too little. But it would be even worse if things were different – if we knew &lt;em&gt;too much;&lt;/em&gt; our task is and remains above all not to mistake ourselves for someone else. We &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; different from scholars, although we are inevitably also, among other things, scholarly. We have different needs, grow differently; have a different digestion: we need more; we also need less. There is no formula for how much a spirit needs for its nourishment; but if it has a taste for independence, for quick coming and going, for wandering, perhaps for adventures of which only the swiftest are capable, it would rather live free with little food than unfree and stuffed. It is not fat but the greatest possible suppleness and strength that a good dancer wants from his nourishment and I wouldn’t know what the spirit of a philosopher might more want to be than a good dancer. For the dance is his ideal, also his art, and finally also his only piety, his ‘service of God’.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The great health.&lt;/em&gt; – We who are new, nameless, hard to understand; we premature births of an as yet unproved future – for a new end, we also need a new means, namely, a new health that is stronger, craftier, tougher, bolder, and more cheerful than any previous health. Anyone whose soul thirsts to experience the whole range of previous values and aspirations, to sail around all the coasts of this ‘inland sea’ (&lt;em&gt;Mittelmeer&lt;/em&gt;) of ideals, anyone who wants to know from the adventures of his own experience how it feels to be the discoverer or conqueror of an ideal, or to be an artist, a saint, a lawmaker, a sage, a pious man, a soothsayer, an old-style divine loner – any such person needs one thing above all – &lt;em&gt;the great health,&lt;/em&gt; a health that one doesn’t only have, but also acquires continually and must acquire because one gives it up again and again, and must give it up!&amp;hellip;And now, after being on our way in this manner for a long time, we argonauts of the ideal – braver, perhaps, than is prudent and often suffering shipwreck and damage but, to repeat, healthier than one would like to admit, dangerously healthy; ever again healthy – it seems to us as if, in reward, we face an as yet undiscovered land the boundaries of which no one has yet surveyed, beyond all the lands and corners of the ideal heretofore, a world so over-rich in what is beautiful, strange, questionable, terrible, and divine that our curiosity and our thirst to possess it have veered beyond control – alas, so that nothing will sate us anymore! After such vistas and with such a burning hunger in our conscience and science, how could we still be satisfied with &lt;em&gt;modern-day man?&lt;/em&gt; Too bad – but it’s inevitable that we look at his worthiest goals and hopes with a seriousness which is difficult to maintain; maybe we don’t even look at all any more. Another ideal runs before us, a peculiar, seductive, dangerous ideal to which we wouldn’t want to persuade anyone, since we don’t readily concede &lt;em&gt;the right to it&lt;/em&gt; to anyone: the ideal of a spirit that plays naively, i.e. not deliberately but from overflowing abundance and power, with everything that was hitherto called holy, good, untouchable, divine; a spirit which has gone so far that the highest thing which the common people quite understandably accepts as its measure of value would signify for it danger, decay, debasement, or at any rate recreation, blindness, temporary self-oblivion: the ideal of a human, superhuman well-being and benevolence that will often enough appear &lt;em&gt;inhuman&lt;/em&gt; – for example, when it places itself next to all earthly seriousness heretofore, all forms of solemnity in gesture, word, tone, look, morality, and task as if it were their most incarnate and involuntary parody – and in spite of all this, it is perhaps only with it that &lt;em&gt;the great seriousness&lt;/em&gt; really emerges; that the real question mark is posed for the first time; that the destiny of the soul changes; the hand of the clock moves forward; the tragedy begins.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Epilogue.&lt;/em&gt; – But as I finally slowly, slowly paint this gloomy question mark and am still willing to remind my readers of the virtues of reading in the right way – oh, what forgotten and unknown virtues! – it strikes me that I hear all around myself most malicious, cheerful, hobgoblinlike laughter: the spirits of my book are themselves descending upon me, pulling my ears and calling me to order. ‘We can’t stand it anymore’, they shout, ‘stop, stop this raven-black music! Are we not surrounded by bright mid-morning? And by soft ground and green grass, the kingdom of the dance? Was there ever a better hour for gaiety? Who will sing us a song, a morning song, so sunny, so light, so full-fledged that it does &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; chase away the crickets55 but instead invites them to join in the singing and dancing? And even plain, rustic bagpipes would be better than the mysterious sounds, such bog-cries, voices from the crypt, and marmot whistles with which you have so far regaled us in your wilderness, my Mr. Hermit and Musician of the Future!56 No! Not such sounds! Let us rather strike up more pleasant, more joyous tones!’57 Does it please you &lt;em&gt;now,&lt;/em&gt; my impatient friends? Well then, who wouldn’t like to please you? My bagpipes are already waiting; my throat, too – it may sound a bit rough, but put up with it; after all, we’re in the mountains. At least what you are about to hear is new; and if you don’t understand it, if you misunderstand the &lt;em&gt;singer,&lt;/em&gt; what does it matter? This happens to be ‘the singer’s curse’.58 You will be able to hear his music and tune so much the better, and so much the better will you be able to dance to his pipe. Is that what you &lt;em&gt;want?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;—I shall go back a bit, and tell you the &lt;em&gt;authentic&lt;/em&gt; history of Christianity.—The very word “Christianity” is a misunderstanding—at bottom there was only one Christian, and he died on the cross. The “Gospels” &lt;em&gt;died&lt;/em&gt; on the cross. What, from that moment onward, was called the “Gospels” was the very reverse of what &lt;em&gt;he&lt;/em&gt; had lived: “bad tidings,” a &lt;em&gt;Dysangelium&lt;/em&gt;.[14] It is an error amounting to nonsensicality to see in “faith,” and particularly in faith in salvation through Christ, the distinguishing mark of the Christian: only the Christian &lt;em&gt;way of life&lt;/em&gt;, the life &lt;em&gt;lived&lt;/em&gt; by him who died on the cross, is Christian&amp;hellip;. To this day &lt;em&gt;such&lt;/em&gt; a life is still possible, and for &lt;em&gt;certain&lt;/em&gt; men even necessary: genuine, primitive Christianity will remain possible in all ages&amp;hellip;. &lt;em&gt;Not&lt;/em&gt; faith, but acts; above all, an &lt;em&gt;avoidance&lt;/em&gt; of acts, a different &lt;em&gt;state of being&lt;/em&gt;&amp;hellip;. States of consciousness, faith of a sort, the acceptance, for example, of anything as true—as every psychologist knows, the value of these things is perfectly indifferent and fifth-rate compared to that of the instincts: strictly speaking, the whole concept of intellectual causality is false. To reduce being a Christian, the state of Christianity, to an acceptance of truth, to a mere phenomenon of consciousness, is to formulate the negation of Christianity. &lt;em&gt;In fact, there are no Christians.&lt;/em&gt; The “Christian”—he who for two thousand years has passed as a Christian—is simply a psychological self-delusion. Closely examined, it appears that, &lt;em&gt;despite&lt;/em&gt; all his “faith,” he has been ruled &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; by his instincts—and &lt;em&gt;what instincts&lt;/em&gt;!—In all ages—for example, in the case of Luther—“faith” has been no more than a cloak, a pretense, a &lt;em&gt;curtain&lt;/em&gt; behind which the instincts have played their game—a shrewd &lt;em&gt;blindness&lt;/em&gt; to the domination of &lt;em&gt;certain&lt;/em&gt; of the instincts&amp;hellip;. I have already called “faith” the specially Christian form of &lt;em&gt;shrewdness&lt;/em&gt;—people always &lt;em&gt;talk&lt;/em&gt; of their “faith” and &lt;em&gt;act&lt;/em&gt; according to their instincts&amp;hellip;. In the world of ideas of the Christian there is nothing that so much as touches reality: on the contrary, one recognizes an instinctive &lt;em&gt;hatred&lt;/em&gt; of reality as the motive power, the only motive power at the bottom of Christianity. What follows therefrom? That even here, in &lt;em&gt;psychologicis&lt;/em&gt;, there is a radical error, which is to say one conditioning fundamentals, which is to say, one in &lt;em&gt;substance&lt;/em&gt;. Take away one idea and put a genuine reality in its place—and the whole of Christianity crumbles to nothingness!—Viewed calmly, this strangest of all phenomena, a religion not only depending on errors, but inventive and ingenious &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; in devising injurious errors, poisonous to life and to the heart—this remains a &lt;em&gt;spectacle for the gods&lt;/em&gt;—for those gods who are also philosophers, and whom I have encountered, for example, in the celebrated dialogues at Naxos. At the moment when their &lt;em&gt;disgust&lt;/em&gt; leaves them (—and us!) they will be thankful for the spectacle afforded by the Christians: perhaps because of &lt;em&gt;this&lt;/em&gt; curious exhibition alone the wretched little planet called the earth deserves a glance from omnipotence, a show of divine interest&amp;hellip;. Therefore, let us not underestimate the Christians: the Christian, false &lt;em&gt;to the point of innocence&lt;/em&gt;, is far above the ape—in its application to the Christians a well-known theory of descent becomes a mere piece of politeness&amp;hellip;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Changed taste.&lt;/em&gt; – Change in common taste is more important than that in opinions; opinions along with proofs, refutations, and the whole intellectual masquerade are only symptoms of a changed taste and most certainly &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; what they are so often taken to be, its causes. How does common taste change? Through individuals – powerful, influential, and without any sense of shame – who announce and tyrannically enforce &lt;em&gt;their hoc est ridiculum, hoc est absurdum&lt;/em&gt;,29 i.e. the judgement of their taste and disgust: thus they put many under pressure, which gradually turns into a habit among even more and finally becomes a &lt;em&gt;need of everyone.&lt;/em&gt; The reason why these individuals sense and ‘taste’ differently is usually found in a peculiarity of their lifestyle, nutrition, digestion, maybe a deficit or excess of inorganic salts in their blood and brains – in short, in their *physis:*30 they have the courage to own up to their &lt;em&gt;physis&lt;/em&gt; and to heed its demands down to its subtlest tones. Their aesthetic and moral judgements are such ‘subtlest tones’ of the &lt;em&gt;physis.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Finally, lest what is most important remain unsaid: from such abysses, from such severe illness, also from the illness of severe suspicion, one returns &lt;em&gt;newborn,&lt;/em&gt; having shed one’s skin, more ticklish and malicious, with a more delicate taste for joy, with a more tender tongue for all good things, with merrier senses, joyful with a more dangerous second innocence, more childlike, and at the same time a hundred times subtler than one had ever been before. How repulsive enjoyment is to us now, that crude, muggy, brown enjoyment as understood by those who enjoy it, our ‘educated’, our rich, and our rulers! How maliciously we nowadays listen to the great fairground boom-boom with which the ‘educated person’ and urbanite today allows art, books and music – aided by spirituous beverages – to rape him for ‘forms of spiritual enjoyment’! How the theatrical cry of passion now hurts our ears; that whole romantic uproar and tumult of the senses that is loved by the educated mob together with its aspirations towards the sublime, the elevated, the distorted, how foreign it has become to our taste! No, if we convalescents still need art, it is &lt;em&gt;another kind&lt;/em&gt; of art – a mocking, light, fleeting, divinely untroubled, divinely artificial art that, like a bright flame, blazes into an unclouded sky! Above all: an art for artists, only for artists! In addition we will know better what is first and foremost needed &lt;em&gt;for that:&lt;/em&gt; cheerfulness – any cheerfulness, my friends! As artists, too, we will know this – I would like to prove it. There are some things we now know too well, we knowing ones: oh, how we nowadays learn as artists to forget well, to be good at &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; knowing! And as for our future, one will hardly find us again on the paths of those Egyptian youths5 who make temples unsafe at night, embrace statues, and want by all means to unveil, uncover, and put into a bright light whatever is kept concealed for good reasons. No, we have grown sick of this bad taste, this will to truth, to ‘truth at any price’, this youthful madness in the love of truth: we are too experienced, too serious, too jovial, too burned, too deep for that&amp;hellip;We no longer believe that truth remains truth when one pulls off the veil; we have lived too much to believe this. Today we consider it a matter of decency not to wish to see everything naked, to be present everywhere, to understand and ‘know’ everything. ‘Is it true that God is everywhere?’ a little girl asked her mother; ‘I find that indecent!’ – a hint for philosophers! One should have more respect for the &lt;em&gt;bashfulness&lt;/em&gt; with which nature has hidden behind riddles and iridescent uncertainties. Perhaps truth is a woman who has grounds for not showing her grounds? Perhaps her name is – to speak Greek – *Baubo?*6&amp;hellip;Oh, those Greeks! They knew how to &lt;em&gt;live:&lt;/em&gt; what is needed for that is to stop bravely at the surface, the fold, the skin; to worship appearance, to believe in shapes, tones, words – in the whole Olympus of appearance! Those Greeks were superficial – &lt;em&gt;out of profundity!&lt;/em&gt; And is not this precisely what we are coming back to, we daredevils of the spirit who have climbed the highest and most dangerous peak of current thought and looked around from up there, looked &lt;em&gt;down&lt;/em&gt; from up there? Are we not just in this respect – Greeks? Worshippers of shapes, tones, words? And therefore – artists?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It may be quite true that controversy often does more harm than good, that it encourages the worst of all talents, that of plausibility, not to say dishonesty, and generally leaves the world at large worse confounded than it was before. It has been said that no clever lawyer would shrink from taking a brief to prove that the earth forms the centre of the world, and, with all respect for English juries, it is not impossible that even in our days he might gain a verdict against Galileo. Nor do I deny that there is a power and vitality in truth which in the end overcomes and survives all opposition, as shown by the very doctrine of Galileo which at present is held by hundreds and thousands who would find it extremely difficult to advance one single argument in its support. I am ready to admit also that those who have done the best work, and have contributed most largely toward the advancement of knowledge and the progress of truth, have seldom wasted their time in controversy, but have marched on straight, little concerned either about applause on the right or abuse on the left. All this is true, perfectly true, and yet I feel that I cannot escape from devoting the whole of a lecture to the answering of certain objections which have been raised against the views which I have put forward with regard to the character and the historical importance of Vedic literature. We must not forget that the whole subject is new, the[136] number of competent judges small, and mistakes not only possible, but almost inevitable. Besides, there are mistakes and mistakes, and the errors of able men are often instructive, nay one might say sometimes almost indispensable for the discovery of truth. There are criticisms which may be safely ignored, criticisms for the sake of criticism, if not inspired by meaner motives. But there are doubts and difficulties which suggest themselves naturally, objections which have a right to be heard, and the very removal of which forms the best approach to the stronghold of truth. Nowhere has this principle been so fully recognized and been acted on as in Indian literature. Whatever subject is started, the rule is that the argument should begin with the pūrvapaksha, with all that can be said against a certain opinion. Every possible objection is welcome, if only it is not altogether frivolous and absurd, and then only follows the uttarapaksha, with all that can be said against these objections and in support of the original opinion. Only when this process has been fully gone through is it allowed to represent an opinion as siddhānta, or established.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The Self in the Mirror&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Chapter Four&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The Chandogya Upanishad relates how Indra, king of the devas, and Virochana, king of the demons, both became students of the science of self-realization under Brahma. Brahma, to test them first, told them that the self was what they saw when they looked into a mirror or a pan of water. Virochana believed and went back to become a guru, teaching this to the other demons, who also believed; but Indra had second thoughts and returned to receive the true knowledge of the self as soul.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;—The fate of the Gospels was decided by death—it hung on the “cross.”&amp;hellip; It was only death, that unexpected and shameful death; it was only the cross, which was usually reserved for the canaille only—it was only this appalling paradox which brought the disciples face to face with the real riddle: “&lt;em&gt;Who was it? what was it&lt;/em&gt;?”—The feeling of dismay, of profound affront and injury; the suspicion that such a death might involve a &lt;em&gt;refutation&lt;/em&gt; of their cause; the terrible question, “Why just in this way?”—this state of mind is only too easy to understand. Here everything &lt;em&gt;must&lt;/em&gt; be accounted for as necessary; everything must have a meaning, a reason, the highest sort of reason; the love of a disciple excludes all chance. Only then did the chasm of doubt yawn: “&lt;em&gt;Who&lt;/em&gt; put him to death? who was his natural enemy?”—this question flashed like a lightning-stroke. Answer: dominant Judaism, its ruling class. From that moment, one found one’s self in revolt &lt;em&gt;against&lt;/em&gt; the established order, and began to understand Jesus as &lt;em&gt;in revolt against the established order&lt;/em&gt;. Until then this militant, this nay-saying, nay-doing element in his character had been lacking; what is more, he had appeared to present its opposite. Obviously, the little community had &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; understood what was precisely the most important thing of all: the example offered by this way of dying, the freedom from and superiority to every feeling of &lt;em&gt;ressentiment&lt;/em&gt;—a plain indication of how little he was understood at all! All that Jesus could hope to accomplish by his death, in itself, was to offer the strongest possible proof, or &lt;em&gt;example&lt;/em&gt;, of his teachings in the most public manner&amp;hellip;. But his disciples were very far from &lt;em&gt;forgiving&lt;/em&gt; his death—though to have done so would have accorded with the Gospels in the highest degree; and neither were they prepared to &lt;em&gt;offer&lt;/em&gt; themselves, with gentle and serene calmness of heart, for a similar death&amp;hellip;. On the contrary, it was precisely the most unevangelical of feelings, &lt;em&gt;revenge&lt;/em&gt;, that now possessed them. It seemed impossible that the cause should perish with his death: “recompense” and “judgment” became necessary (—yet what could be less evangelical than “recompense,” “punishment,” and “sitting in judgment”!). Once more the popular belief in the coming of a messiah appeared in the foreground; attention was rivetted upon an historical moment: the “kingdom of God” is to come, with judgment upon his enemies&amp;hellip;. But in all this there was a wholesale misunderstanding: imagine the “kingdom of God” as a last act, as a mere promise! The Gospels had been, in fact, the incarnation, the fulfilment, the &lt;em&gt;realization&lt;/em&gt; of this “kingdom of God.” It was only now that all the familiar contempt for and bitterness against Pharisees and theologians began to appear in the character of the Master—he was thereby &lt;em&gt;turned&lt;/em&gt; into a Pharisee and theologian himself! On the other hand, the savage veneration of these completely unbalanced souls could no longer endure the Gospel doctrine, taught by Jesus, of the equal right of all men to be children of God: their revenge took the form of &lt;em&gt;elevating&lt;/em&gt; Jesus in an extravagant fashion, and thus separating him from themselves: just as, in earlier times, the Jews, to revenge themselves upon their enemies, separated themselves from their God, and placed him on a great height. The One God and the Only Son of God: both were products of &lt;em&gt;ressentiment&lt;/em&gt;&amp;hellip;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;On the lack of noble style.&lt;/em&gt; – Soldiers and leaders still have a far higher relation to one another than do workers and employers. So far at least, all cultures with a military basis are still high above so-called industrial culture: the latter in its present form is altogether the most vulgar form of existence that has ever been. Here it is simply the law of need operating: one wants to live and has to sell oneself, but one despises those who exploit this need and &lt;em&gt;buy&lt;/em&gt; the worker. It is strange that submission to powerful, frightening, yes, terrifying persons, to tyrants and generals, is experienced to be not nearly as distressing as this submission to unknown and uninteresting persons, which is what all the greats of industry are: the worker usually sees in the employer only a cunning, bloodsucking dog of a man who speculates on all distress and whose name, figure, manner, and reputation are completely indifferent to him. So far the manufacturers and large-scale commercial entrepreneurs have apparently been much too lacking in all the manners and signs of &lt;em&gt;higher race&lt;/em&gt; that alone enable a person to become &lt;em&gt;interesting;&lt;/em&gt; if they had the refinement of noble breeding in their eye and gesture, there might not be any socialism of the masses. For the masses are basically prepared to submit to any kind of &lt;em&gt;slavery&lt;/em&gt; provided that the superiors constantly legitimize themselves as higher, as &lt;em&gt;born&lt;/em&gt; to command – through refined demeanour! The commonest man senses that refinement cannot be improvised and that one has to honour in it the fruit of long ages – but the absence of the higher demeanour and the notorious manufacturer’s vulgarity with ruddy, plump hands give him the idea that it is only accident and luck that elevated one above the other in this case: well, then, he infers, let &lt;em&gt;us&lt;/em&gt; try accident and luck! Let &lt;em&gt;us&lt;/em&gt; throw the dice! – and socialism begins.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;—And from that time onward an absurd problem offered itself: “how &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; God allow it!” To which the deranged reason of the little community formulated an answer that was terrifying in its absurdity: God gave his son as a &lt;em&gt;sacrifice&lt;/em&gt; for the forgiveness of sins. At once there was an end of the gospels! Sacrifice for sin, and in its most obnoxious and barbarous form: sacrifice of the &lt;em&gt;innocent&lt;/em&gt; for the sins of the guilty! What appalling paganism!—Jesus himself had done away with the very concept of “guilt,” he denied that there was any gulf fixed between God and man; he &lt;em&gt;lived&lt;/em&gt; this unity between God and man, and that was precisely &lt;em&gt;his&lt;/em&gt; “glad tidings”&amp;hellip;. And &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; as a mere privilege!—From this time forward the type of the Saviour was corrupted, bit by bit, by the doctrine of judgment and of the second coming, the doctrine of death as a sacrifice, the doctrine of the &lt;em&gt;resurrection&lt;/em&gt;, by means of which the entire concept of “blessedness,” the whole and only reality of the gospels, is juggled away—in favour of a state of existence &lt;em&gt;after&lt;/em&gt; death!&amp;hellip; St. Paul, with that rabbinical impudence which shows itself in all his doings, gave a logical quality to that conception, that &lt;em&gt;indecent&lt;/em&gt; conception, in this way: “&lt;em&gt;If&lt;/em&gt; Christ did not rise from the dead, then all our faith is in vain!”—And at once there sprang from the Gospels the most contemptible of all unfulfillable promises, the &lt;em&gt;shameless&lt;/em&gt; doctrine of personal immortality&amp;hellip;. Paul even preached it as a &lt;em&gt;reward&lt;/em&gt;&amp;hellip;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Against remorse.&lt;/em&gt; – The thinker sees his own actions as experiments and questions, as seeking explanations of something: to him, success and failure are primarily &lt;em&gt;answers.&lt;/em&gt; To be vexed or even to feel remorse because something goes wrong – he leaves that to those who act because they were ordered to do so and who expect a beating when his gracious lordship is not pleased with the result.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;One now begins to see just &lt;em&gt;what&lt;/em&gt; it was that came to an end with the death on the cross: a new and thoroughly original effort to found a Buddhistic peace movement, and so establish &lt;em&gt;happiness on earth&lt;/em&gt;—real, &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; merely promised. For this remains—as I have already pointed out—the essential difference between the two religions of &lt;em&gt;décadence&lt;/em&gt;: Buddhism promises nothing, but actually fulfils; Christianity promises everything, but &lt;em&gt;fulfils nothing&lt;/em&gt;.—Hard upon the heels of the “glad tidings” came the worst imaginable: those of Paul. In Paul is incarnated the very opposite of the “bearer of glad tidings”; he represents the genius for hatred, the vision of hatred, the relentless logic of hatred. &lt;em&gt;What&lt;/em&gt;, indeed, has not this dysangelist sacrificed to hatred! Above all, the Saviour: he nailed him to &lt;em&gt;his own&lt;/em&gt; cross. The life, the example, the teaching, the death of Christ, the meaning and the law of the whole gospels—nothing was left of all this after that counterfeiter in hatred had reduced it to his uses. Surely &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; reality; surely &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; historical truth!&amp;hellip; Once more the priestly instinct of the Jew perpetrated the same old master crime against history—he simply struck out the yesterday and the day before yesterday of Christianity, and &lt;em&gt;invented his own history of Christian beginnings&lt;/em&gt;. Going further, he treated the history of Israel to another falsification, so that it became a mere prologue to &lt;em&gt;his&lt;/em&gt; achievement: all the prophets, it now appeared, had referred to &lt;em&gt;his&lt;/em&gt; “Saviour.”&amp;hellip; Later on the church even falsified the history of man in order to make it a prologue to Christianity&amp;hellip;. The figure of the Saviour, his teaching, his way of life, his death, the meaning of his death, even the consequences of his death—nothing remained untouched, nothing remained in even remote contact with reality. Paul simply shifted the centre of gravity of that whole life to a place &lt;em&gt;behind&lt;/em&gt; this existence—in the &lt;em&gt;lie&lt;/em&gt; of the “risen” Jesus. At bottom, he had no use for the life of the Saviour—what he needed was the death on the cross, &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; something more. To see anything honest in such a man as Paul, whose home was at the centre of the Stoical enlightenment, when he converts an hallucination into a &lt;em&gt;proof&lt;/em&gt; of the resurrection of the Saviour, or even to believe his tale that he suffered from this hallucination himself—this would be a genuine &lt;em&gt;niaiserie&lt;/em&gt; in a psychologist. Paul willed the end; &lt;em&gt;therefore&lt;/em&gt; he also willed the means&amp;hellip;. What he himself didn’t believe was swallowed readily enough by the idiots among whom he spread &lt;em&gt;his&lt;/em&gt; teaching.—What &lt;em&gt;he&lt;/em&gt; wanted was power; in Paul the priest once more reached out for power—he had use only for such concepts, teachings and symbols as served the purpose of tyrannizing over the masses and organizing mobs. &lt;em&gt;What&lt;/em&gt; was the only part of Christianity that Mohammed borrowed later on? Paul’s invention, his device for establishing priestly tyranny and organizing the mob: the belief in the immortality of the soul—&lt;em&gt;that is to say, the doctrine of “judgment”&lt;/em&gt;&amp;hellip;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Work and boredom.&lt;/em&gt; – Seeking work for the sake of wages – in this, nearly all people in civilized countries are alike; to all of them, work is just a means and not itself the end, which is why they are unrefined in their choice of work, provided it yields an ample reward. Now there are rare individuals who would rather perish than work without taking &lt;em&gt;pleasure&lt;/em&gt; in their work: they are choosy, hard to please, and have no use for ample rewards if the work is not itself the reward of rewards. To this rare breed belong artists and contemplative men of all kinds, but also men of leisure who spend their lives hunting, travelling, in love affairs, or on adventures. All of them want work and misery as long as it is joined with pleasure, and the heaviest, hardest work, if need be. Otherwise they are resolutely idle, even if it spells impoverishment, dishonour, and danger to life and limb. They do not fear boredom as much as work without pleasure; indeed, they need a lot of boredom if &lt;em&gt;their&lt;/em&gt; work is to succeed. For the thinker and for all inventive spirits, boredom is that disagreeable ‘lull’ of the soul that precedes a happy voyage and cheerful winds; he has to endure it, must &lt;em&gt;await&lt;/em&gt; its effect on him – precisely &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; is what lesser natures are totally unable to achieve! To fend off boredom at any price is vulgar, just as work without pleasure is vulgar. Perhaps Asians are distinguished as above Europeans by their capacity for a longer, deeper calm; even their narcotics work slowly and require patience, in contrast to the revolting suddenness of the European poison, alcohol.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;When the centre of gravity of life is placed, &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; in life itself, but in “the beyond”—in &lt;em&gt;nothingness&lt;/em&gt;—then one has taken away its centre of gravity altogether. The vast lie of personal immortality destroys all reason, all natural instinct—henceforth, everything in the instincts that is beneficial, that fosters life and that safeguards the future is a cause of suspicion. So to live that life no longer has any meaning: &lt;em&gt;this&lt;/em&gt; is now the “meaning” of life&amp;hellip;. Why be public-spirited? Why take any pride in descent and forefathers? Why labour together, trust one another, or concern one’s self about the common welfare, and try to serve it?&amp;hellip; Merely so many “temptations,” so many strayings from the “straight path.”—“&lt;em&gt;One&lt;/em&gt; thing only is necessary”&amp;hellip;. That every man, because he has an “immortal soul,” is as good as every other man; that in an infinite universe of things the “salvation” of &lt;em&gt;every&lt;/em&gt; individual may lay claim to eternal importance; that insignificant bigots and the three-fourths insane may assume that the laws of nature are constantly &lt;em&gt;suspended&lt;/em&gt; in their behalf—it is impossible to lavish too much contempt upon such a magnification of every sort of selfishness to infinity, to &lt;em&gt;insolence&lt;/em&gt;. And yet Christianity has to thank precisely &lt;em&gt;this&lt;/em&gt; miserable flattery of personal vanity for its &lt;em&gt;triumph&lt;/em&gt;—it was thus that it lured all the botched, the dissatisfied, the fallen upon evil days, the whole refuse and off-scouring of humanity to its side. The “salvation of the soul”—in plain English: “the world revolves around &lt;em&gt;me&lt;/em&gt;.”&amp;hellip; The poisonous doctrine, “&lt;em&gt;equal&lt;/em&gt; rights for all,” has been propagated as a Christian principle: out of the secret nooks and crannies of bad instinct Christianity has waged a deadly war upon all feelings of reverence and distance between man and man, which is to say, upon the first &lt;em&gt;prerequisite&lt;/em&gt; to every step upward, to every development of civilization—out of the &lt;em&gt;ressentiment&lt;/em&gt; of the masses it has forged its chief weapons against &lt;em&gt;us&lt;/em&gt;, against everything noble, joyous and high-spirited on earth, against our happiness on earth&amp;hellip;. To allow “immortality” to every Peter and Paul was the greatest, the most vicious outrage upon &lt;em&gt;noble&lt;/em&gt; humanity ever perpetrated.—&lt;em&gt;And&lt;/em&gt; let us not underestimate the fatal influence that Christianity has had, even upon politics! Nowadays no one has courage any more for special rights, for the right of dominion, for feelings of honourable pride in himself and his equals—for the &lt;em&gt;pathos of distance&lt;/em&gt;&amp;hellip;. Our politics is sick with this lack of courage!—The aristocratic attitude of mind has been undermined by the lie of the equality of souls; and if belief in the “privileges of the majority” makes and &lt;em&gt;will continue to make&lt;/em&gt; revolutions—it is Christianity, let us not doubt, and &lt;em&gt;Christian&lt;/em&gt; valuations, which convert every revolution into a carnival of blood and crime! Christianity is a revolt of all creatures that creep on the ground against everything that is &lt;em&gt;lofty&lt;/em&gt;: the gospel of the “lowly” &lt;em&gt;lowers&lt;/em&gt;&amp;hellip;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;What the laws betray.&lt;/em&gt; – It is a grave error to study a people’s penal code as if it were an expression of its character; the laws do not betray what a people is but rather what appears to it as foreign, strange, uncanny, outlandish. The laws concern the exceptions to the morality of custom (&lt;em&gt;Sittlichkeit der&lt;/em&gt; Sitte)31, and the severest punishments are for things that accord with the customs of the neighbouring people. Thus the Wahanabis32 have only two mortal sins: having a god other than the Wahanabi god and – smoking (which they call ‘the disgraceful way of drinking’). ‘And what about murder and adultery?’ asked the Englishman, amazed, who found this out. ‘God is gracious and merciful’, the old chief replied. Thus the old Romans had the notion that a woman could commit only two mortal sins: adultery and – drinking wine. Old Cato thought that kissing among relatives had been made into a custom only in order to keep the women under control in this regard; a kiss meant, ‘Does she smell of wine?’33 Women caught with wine were actually put to death; and certainly not just because sometimes women under the influence of wine completely forgot how to say no; above all, the Romans feared the orgiastic and Dionysian cult which afflicted the women of southern Europe from time to time when wine was still new in Europe – feared it as a foreign monster that overthrew the basis of Roman sensibility; to them it seemed like a betrayal of Rome, like the embodiment of the foreign.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;—The gospels are invaluable as evidence of the corruption that was already persistent &lt;em&gt;within&lt;/em&gt; the primitive community. That which Paul, with the cynical logic of a rabbi, later developed to a conclusion was at bottom merely a process of decay that had begun with the death of the Saviour.—These gospels cannot be read too carefully; difficulties lurk behind every word. I confess—I hope it will not be held against me—that it is precisely for this reason that they offer first-rate joy to a psychologist—as the &lt;em&gt;opposite&lt;/em&gt; of all merely naïve corruption, as refinement &lt;em&gt;par excellence&lt;/em&gt;, as an artistic triumph in psychological corruption. The gospels, in fact, stand alone. The Bible as a whole is not to be compared to them. Here we are among Jews: this is the &lt;em&gt;first&lt;/em&gt; thing to be borne in mind if we are not to lose the thread of the matter. This positive genius for conjuring up a delusion of personal “holiness” unmatched anywhere else, either in books or by men; this elevation of fraud in word and attitude to the level of an &lt;em&gt;art&lt;/em&gt;—all this is not an accident due to the chance talents of an individual, or to any violation of nature. The thing responsible is &lt;em&gt;race&lt;/em&gt;. The whole of Judaism appears in Christianity as the art of concocting holy lies, and there, after many centuries of earnest Jewish training and hard practice of Jewish technic, the business comes to the stage of mastery. The Christian, that &lt;em&gt;ultima ratio&lt;/em&gt; of lying, is the Jew all over again—he is &lt;em&gt;threefold&lt;/em&gt; the Jew&amp;hellip;. The underlying will to make use only of such concepts, symbols and attitudes as fit into priestly practice, the instinctive repudiation of every &lt;em&gt;other&lt;/em&gt; mode of thought, and every other method of estimating values and utilities—this is not only tradition, it is &lt;em&gt;inheritance&lt;/em&gt;: only as an inheritance is it able to operate with the force of nature. The whole of mankind, even the best minds of the best ages (with one exception, perhaps hardly human—), have permitted themselves to be deceived. The gospels have been read as a &lt;em&gt;book of innocence&lt;/em&gt; &amp;hellip; surely no small indication of the high skill with which the trick has been done.—Of course, if we could actually &lt;em&gt;see&lt;/em&gt; these astounding bigots and bogus saints, even if only for an instant, the farce would come to an end,—and it is precisely because &lt;em&gt;I&lt;/em&gt; cannot read a word of theirs without seeing their attitudinizing that &lt;em&gt;I have made an end of them&lt;/em&gt;&amp;hellip;. I simply cannot endure the way they have of rolling up their eyes.—For the majority, happily enough, books are mere &lt;em&gt;literature&lt;/em&gt;.—Let us not be led astray: they say “judge not,” and yet they condemn to hell whoever stands in their way. In letting God sit in judgment they judge themselves; in glorifying God they glorify themselves; in &lt;em&gt;demanding&lt;/em&gt; that every one show the virtues which they themselves happen to be capable of—still more, which they &lt;em&gt;must&lt;/em&gt; have in order to remain on top—they assume the grand air of men struggling for virtue, of men engaging in a war that virtue may prevail. “We live, we die, we sacrifice ourselves &lt;em&gt;for the good&lt;/em&gt;” (—“the truth,” “the light,” “the kingdom of God”): in point of fact, they simply do what they cannot help doing. Forced, like hypocrites, to be sneaky, to hide in corners, to slink along in the shadows, they convert their necessity into a &lt;em&gt;duty&lt;/em&gt;: it is on grounds of duty that they account for their lives of humility, and that humility becomes merely one more proof of their piety&amp;hellip;. Ah, that humble, chaste, charitable brand of fraud! “Virtue itself shall bear witness for us.”&amp;hellip; One may read the gospels as books of &lt;em&gt;moral&lt;/em&gt; seduction: these petty folks fasten themselves to morality—they know the uses of morality! Morality is the best of all devices for leading mankind &lt;em&gt;by the nose&lt;/em&gt;!—The fact is that the conscious conceit of the chosen here disguises itself as modesty: it is in this way that &lt;em&gt;they&lt;/em&gt;, the “community,” the “good and just,” range themselves, once and for always, on one side, the side of “the truth”—and the rest of mankind, “the world,” on the other&amp;hellip;. In &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; we observe the most fatal sort of megalomania that the earth has ever seen: little abortions of bigots and liars began to claim exclusive rights in the concepts of “God,” “the truth,” “the light,” “the spirit,” “love,” “wisdom” and “life,” as if these things were synonyms of themselves and thereby they sought to fence themselves off from the “world”; little super-Jews, ripe for some sort of madhouse, turned values upside down in order to meet &lt;em&gt;their&lt;/em&gt; notions, just as if the Christian were the meaning, the salt, the standard and even the &lt;em&gt;last judgment&lt;/em&gt; of all the rest&amp;hellip;. The whole disaster was only made possible by the fact that there already existed in the world a similar megalomania, allied to this one in race, to wit, the &lt;em&gt;Jewish&lt;/em&gt;: once a chasm began to yawn between Jews and Judaeo-Christians, the latter had no choice but to employ the self-preservative measures that the Jewish instinct had devised, even &lt;em&gt;against&lt;/em&gt; the Jews themselves, whereas the Jews had employed them only against non-Jews. The Christian is simply a Jew of the “reformed” confession.—&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The supposed motives.&lt;/em&gt; – Important as it may be to know the motives from which humanity has acted so far, it might be even more essential to know the &lt;em&gt;belief&lt;/em&gt; people had in this or that motive, i.e. what humanity has imagined and told itself to be the real lever of its conduct so far. For people’s inner happiness and misery has come to them depending on their belief in this or that motive – &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; through the actual motives. The latter are of second-order interest.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;—I offer a few examples of the sort of thing these petty people have got into their heads—what they have &lt;em&gt;put into the mouth&lt;/em&gt; of the Master: the unalloyed creed of “beautiful souls.”—&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;“And whosoever shall not receive you, nor hear you, when ye depart thence, shake off the dust under your feet for a testimony against them. Verily I say unto you, it shall be more tolerable for Sodom and Gomorrha in the day of judgment, than for that city” (Markvi, 11)—How &lt;em&gt;evangelical&lt;/em&gt;!&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Epicurus&lt;/em&gt;.34 – Yes, I am proud to experience Epicurus’ character in a way unlike perhaps anyone else and to enjoy, in everything I hear and read of him, the happiness of the afternoon of antiquity: I see his eye gaze at a wide whitish sea, across shoreline rocks bathed in the sun, as large and small creatures play in its light, secure and calm like the light and his eye itself. Only someone who is continually suffering could invent such happiness – the happiness of an eye before which the sea of existence has grown still and which now cannot get enough of seeing the surface and this colourful, tender, quivering skin of the sea: never before has voluptuousness been so modest.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;—&lt;em&gt;What follows, then?&lt;/em&gt; That one had better put on gloves before reading the New Testament. The presence of so much filth makes it very advisable. One would as little choose “early Christians” for companions as Polish Jews: not that one need seek out an objection to them&amp;hellip;. Neither has a pleasant smell.—I have searched the New Testament in vain for a single sympathetic touch; nothing is there that is free, kindly, open-hearted or upright. In it humanity does not even make the first step upward—the instinct for &lt;em&gt;cleanliness&lt;/em&gt; is lacking&amp;hellip;. Only &lt;em&gt;evil&lt;/em&gt; instincts are there, and there is not even the courage of these evil instincts. It is all cowardice; it is all a shutting of the eyes, a self-deception. Every other book becomes clean, once one has read the New Testament: for example, immediately after reading Paul I took up with delight that most charming and wanton of scoffers, Petronius, of whom one may say what Domenico Boccaccio wrote of Cæsar Borgia to the Duke of Parma: “&lt;em&gt;è tutto festo&lt;/em&gt;”—immortally healthy, immortally cheerful and sound&amp;hellip;. These petty bigots make a capital miscalculation. They attack, but everything they attack is thereby &lt;em&gt;distinguished&lt;/em&gt;. Whoever is attacked by an “early Christian” is surely &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; befouled&amp;hellip;. On the contrary, it is an honour to have an “early Christian” as an opponent. One cannot read the New Testament without acquired admiration for whatever it abuses—not to speak of the “wisdom of this world,” which an impudent wind-bag tries to dispose of “by the foolishness of preaching.”&amp;hellip; Even the scribes and pharisees are benefitted by such opposition: they must certainly have been worth something to have been hated in such an indecent manner. Hypocrisy—as if this were a charge that the “early Christians” &lt;em&gt;dared&lt;/em&gt; to make!—After all, they were the &lt;em&gt;privileged&lt;/em&gt;, and that was enough: the hatred of the Chandala needed no other excuse. The “early Christian”—and also, I fear, the “last Christian,” &lt;em&gt;whom I may perhaps live to see&lt;/em&gt;—is a rebel against all privilege by profound instinct—he lives and makes war for ever for “equal rights.”&amp;hellip; Strictly speaking, he has no alternative. When a man proposes to represent, in his own person, the “chosen of God”—or to be a “temple of God,” or a “judge of the angels”—then every &lt;em&gt;other&lt;/em&gt; criterion, whether based upon honesty, upon intellect, upon manliness and pride, or upon beauty and freedom of the heart, becomes simply “worldly”—&lt;em&gt;evil in itself&lt;/em&gt;&amp;hellip;. Moral: every word that comes from the lips of an “early Christian” is a lie, and his every act is instinctively dishonest—all his values, all his aims are noxious, but &lt;em&gt;whoever&lt;/em&gt; he hates, &lt;em&gt;whatever&lt;/em&gt; he hates, has real &lt;em&gt;value&lt;/em&gt;&amp;hellip;. The Christian, and particularly the Christian priest, is thus a &lt;em&gt;criterion of values&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Our amazement.&lt;/em&gt; – It is a deep and fundamental stroke of luck that science discovers things that &lt;em&gt;stand up&lt;/em&gt; under examination and that furnish the basis, again and again, for further discoveries – after all, it could be otherwise! Indeed, we are so convinced of the uncertainty and the fantastical quality of our judgements and of the eternal change of human laws and concepts that it actually amazes us &lt;em&gt;how well&lt;/em&gt; the results of science stand up! Formerly, one knew nothing of the changeableness of everything human; the habit of attachment to customary morality (&lt;em&gt;Sitte der Sittlichkeit&lt;/em&gt;) sustained the faith that the entire inner life of humanity was fastened to iron necessity with eternal clamps; perhaps people then experienced a similarly voluptuous amazement when they told each other stories and fairy tales. The miraculous did a lot of good to those who at times grew weary of the rule and of eternity. To lose firm ground for once! To float! To err! To be mad! – that was part of the paradise and debauchery of former ages, whereas our bliss is like that of the shipwrecked man who has climbed ashore and is standing with both feet on the firm old earth – marvelling because it does not bob up and down.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;—The thing that sets us apart is not that we are unable to find God, either in history, or in nature, or behind nature—but that we regard what has been honoured as God, not as “divine,” but as pitiable, as absurd, as injurious; not as a mere error, but as a &lt;em&gt;crime against life&lt;/em&gt;&amp;hellip;. We deny that God is God&amp;hellip;. If any one were to &lt;em&gt;show&lt;/em&gt; us this Christian God, we’d be still less inclined to believe in him.—In a formula: &lt;em&gt;deus, qualem Paulus creavit, dei negatio&lt;/em&gt;.—Such a religion as Christianity, which does not touch reality at a single point and which goes to pieces the moment reality asserts its rights at any point, must be inevitably the deadly enemy of the “wisdom of this world,” which is to say, of &lt;em&gt;science&lt;/em&gt;—and it will give the name of good to whatever means serve to poison, calumniate and &lt;em&gt;cry down&lt;/em&gt; all intellectual discipline, all lucidity and strictness in matters of intellectual conscience, and all noble coolness and freedom of the mind. “Faith,” as an imperative, vetoes science—&lt;em&gt;in praxi&lt;/em&gt;, lying at any price&amp;hellip;. Paul &lt;em&gt;well knew&lt;/em&gt; that lying—that “faith”—was necessary; later on the church borrowed the fact from Paul.—The God that Paul invented for himself, a God who “reduced to absurdity” “the wisdom of this world” (especially the two great enemies of superstition, philology and medicine), is in truth only an indication of Paul’s resolute &lt;em&gt;determination&lt;/em&gt; to accomplish that very thing himself: to give one’s own will the name of God, &lt;em&gt;thora&lt;/em&gt;—that is essentially Jewish. Paul &lt;em&gt;wants&lt;/em&gt; to dispose of the “wisdom of this world”: his enemies are the &lt;em&gt;good&lt;/em&gt; philologians and physicians of the Alexandrine school—on them he makes his war. As a matter of fact no man can be a &lt;em&gt;philologian&lt;/em&gt; or a physician without being also &lt;em&gt;Antichrist&lt;/em&gt;. That is to say, as a philologian a man sees &lt;em&gt;behind&lt;/em&gt; the “holy books,” and as a physician he sees &lt;em&gt;behind&lt;/em&gt; the physiological degeneration of the typical Christian.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;On the suppression of the passions.&lt;/em&gt; – If one constantly forbids oneself the expression of the passions, as if that were something to be left for the ‘common’, coarser, middle-class, peasant types – i.e. if one wants to suppress not the passions themselves but only their language and gesture – one still attains &lt;em&gt;in addition&lt;/em&gt; what one did not desire: the suppression of the passions themselves, at least their weakening and alteration – the most instructive example being furnished by the court of Louis XIV and everything that depended on it. The age that &lt;em&gt;followed,&lt;/em&gt; brought up in the suppression of expression, no longer had the passions themselves and had in their place a graceful, shallow, playful manner – an age marked by an incapacity for bad manners, so that even an insult was accepted and returned with obliging words. Perhaps the present age supplies the most notable counterpart: everywhere, in life and on the stage, and not the least in everything written, I see the delight in all the &lt;em&gt;coarser&lt;/em&gt; outbursts and gestures of passion: what is demanded these days is a certain convention of the passionate – but not passion itself! Nevertheless, eventually passion &lt;em&gt;itself&lt;/em&gt; will be reached this way, and our progeny will be &lt;em&gt;genuinely savage&lt;/em&gt; and not just savage and unruly in demeanour.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;—Has any one ever clearly understood the celebrated story at the beginning of the Bible—of God’s mortal terror of &lt;em&gt;science&lt;/em&gt;?&amp;hellip; No one, in fact, has understood it. This priest-book &lt;em&gt;par excellence&lt;/em&gt; opens, as is fitting, with the great inner difficulty of the priest: &lt;em&gt;he&lt;/em&gt; faces only one great danger; &lt;em&gt;ergo&lt;/em&gt;, “God” faces only one great danger.—&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The old God, wholly “spirit,” wholly the high-priest, wholly perfect, is promenading his garden: he is bored and trying to kill time. Against boredom even gods struggle in vain.[21] What does he do? He creates man—man is entertaining&amp;hellip;. But then he notices that man is also bored. God’s pity for the only form of distress that invades all paradises knows no bounds: so he forthwith creates other animals. God’s first mistake: to man these other animals were not entertaining—he sought dominion over them; he did not want to be an “animal” himself.—So God created woman. In the act he brought boredom to an end—and also many other things! Woman was the &lt;em&gt;second&lt;/em&gt; mistake of God.—“Woman, at bottom, is a serpent, Heva”—every priest knows that; “from woman comes every evil in the world”—every priest knows that, too. &lt;em&gt;Ergo&lt;/em&gt;, she is also to blame for &lt;em&gt;science&lt;/em&gt;&amp;hellip;. It was through woman that man learned to taste of the tree of knowledge.—What happened? The old God was seized by mortal terror. Man himself had been his &lt;em&gt;greatest&lt;/em&gt; blunder; he had created a rival to himself; science makes men &lt;em&gt;godlike&lt;/em&gt;—it is all up with priests and gods when man becomes scientific!—&lt;em&gt;Moral&lt;/em&gt;: science is the forbidden &lt;em&gt;per se&lt;/em&gt;; it alone is forbidden. Science is the &lt;em&gt;first&lt;/em&gt; of sins, the germ of all sins, the &lt;em&gt;original&lt;/em&gt; sin. &lt;em&gt;This is all there is of morality.&lt;/em&gt;—“Thou shall &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; know”:—the rest follows from that.—God’s mortal terror, however, did not hinder him from being shrewd. How is one to &lt;em&gt;protect&lt;/em&gt; one’s self against science? For a long while this was the capital problem. Answer: Out of paradise with man! Happiness, leisure, foster thought—and all thoughts are bad thoughts!—Man &lt;em&gt;must&lt;/em&gt; not think.—And so the priest invents distress, death, the mortal dangers of childbirth, all sorts of misery, old age, decrepitude, above all, &lt;em&gt;sickness&lt;/em&gt;—nothing but devices for making war on science! The troubles of man don’t &lt;em&gt;allow&lt;/em&gt; him to think&amp;hellip;. Nevertheless—how terrible!—, the edifice of knowledge begins to tower aloft, invading heaven, shadowing the gods—what is to be done?—The old God invents &lt;em&gt;war&lt;/em&gt;; he separates the peoples; he makes men destroy one another (—the priests have always had need of war&amp;hellip;.). War—among other things, a great disturber of science!—Incredible! Knowledge, &lt;em&gt;deliverance from the priests&lt;/em&gt;, prospers in spite of war.—So the old God comes to his final resolution: “Man has become scientific—&lt;em&gt;there is no help for it: he must be drowned!&lt;/em&gt;”&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Knowledge of distress.&lt;/em&gt; – Perhaps nothing separates human beings or ages from each other more than the different degrees of their knowledge of distress – distress of the soul as well as of the body. Regarding the latter we moderns may well, in spite of our frailties and fragilities, be bunglers and dreamers owing to lack of ample first-hand experience, compared with an age of fear, the longest of all ages, when individuals had to protect themselves against violence and to that end had themselves to become men of violence. In those days, a man received ample training in bodily torments and deprivations and understood that even a certain cruelty towards himself, as a voluntary exercise in pain, was a necessary means of his preservation; in those days, one trained one’s surroundings to endure pain; in those days, one gladly inflicted pain and saw the most terrible things of this kind happen to others without any other feeling than that of one’s own safety. As regards the distress of the soul, however, I look at each person today to see whether he knows it through experience or description; whether he still considers it necessary to fake this knowledge, say, as a sign of refined cultivation, or whether at the bottom of his soul he no longer believes in great pains of the soul and reacts to its mention in much the same way as to the mention of great bodily sufferings, which make him think of his toothaches and stomachaches. But that is how most people seem to me to be these days. The general inexperience with both sorts of pain and the relative rarity of the sight of suffering individuals have an important consequence: pain is hated much more now than formerly; one speaks much worse of it; indeed, one can hardly endure the presence of pain &lt;em&gt;as a thought&lt;/em&gt; and makes it a matter of conscience and a reproach against the whole of existence. The emergence of pessimistic philosophers is in no way the sign of great, terrible states of distress; rather, these question marks about the value of all life are made in times when the refinement and ease of existence make even the inevitable mosquito bites of the soul and the body seem much too bloody and malicious, and the poverty of real experiences of pain makes one tend to consider &lt;em&gt;painful general ideas&lt;/em&gt; as already suffering of the highest rank. There is a recipe against pessimistic philosophies and excessive sensitivity, things which seem to me to be the real ‘distress of the present’ – but this recipe may sound too cruel and would itself be counted among the signs that lead people to judge, ‘existence is something evil’. Well, the recipe against this ‘distress’ is: &lt;em&gt;distress.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;—I have been understood. At the opening of the Bible there is the &lt;em&gt;whole&lt;/em&gt; psychology of the priest.—The priest knows of only one great danger: that is science—the sound comprehension of cause and effect. But science flourishes, on the whole, only under favourable conditions—a man must have time, he must have an &lt;em&gt;overflowing&lt;/em&gt; intellect, in order to “know.”&amp;hellip; “&lt;em&gt;Therefore&lt;/em&gt;, man must be made unhappy,”—this has been, in all ages, the logic of the priest.—It is easy to see just &lt;em&gt;what&lt;/em&gt;, by this logic, was the first thing to come into the world:—“&lt;em&gt;sin&lt;/em&gt;.”&amp;hellip; The concept of guilt and punishment, the whole “moral order of the world,” was set up &lt;em&gt;against&lt;/em&gt; science—&lt;em&gt;against&lt;/em&gt; the deliverance of man from priests&amp;hellip;. Man must &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; look outward; he must look inward. He must &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; look at things shrewdly and cautiously, to learn about them; he must not look at all; he must &lt;em&gt;suffer&lt;/em&gt;&amp;hellip;. And he must suffer so much that he is always in need of the priest.—Away with physicians! &lt;em&gt;What is needed is a Saviour.&lt;/em&gt;—The concept of guilt and punishment, including the doctrines of “grace,” of “salvation,” of “forgiveness”—&lt;em&gt;lies&lt;/em&gt; through and through, and absolutely without psychological reality—were devised to destroy man’s &lt;em&gt;sense of causality&lt;/em&gt;: they are an attack upon the concept of cause and effect!—And &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; an attack with the fist, with the knife, with honesty in hate and love! On the contrary, one inspired by the most cowardly, the most crafty, the most ignoble of instincts! An attack of &lt;em&gt;priests&lt;/em&gt;! An attack of &lt;em&gt;parasites&lt;/em&gt;! The vampirism of pale, subterranean leeches!&amp;hellip; When the natural consequences of an act are no longer “natural,” but are regarded as produced by the ghostly creations of superstition—by “God,” by “spirits,” by “souls”—and reckoned as merely “moral” consequences, as rewards, as punishments, as hints, as lessons, then the whole ground-work of knowledge is destroyed—&lt;em&gt;then the greatest of crimes against humanity has been perpetrated&lt;/em&gt;.—I repeat that sin, man’s self-desecration &lt;em&gt;par excellence&lt;/em&gt;, was invented in order to make science, culture, and every elevation and ennobling of man impossible; the priest &lt;em&gt;rules&lt;/em&gt; through the invention of sin.—&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Magnanimity and related things.&lt;/em&gt; – Those paradoxical phenomena, like the sudden coldness in the behaviour of the emotional person, or the humour of the melancholy person, or above all &lt;em&gt;magnanimity&lt;/em&gt; as a sudden renunciation of revenge or a satisfaction of envy, appear in people who have a powerful inner centrifugal force, in people of sudden satiety and sudden nausea. Their satisfactions are so quick and strong that they are immediately followed by weariness and aversion and a flight into the opposite taste: in this opposite, the cramp of feeling is resolved – in one person by sudden cold, in another by laughter, in a third by tears and self-sacrifice. The magnanimous person – at least the type of magnanimous person who has always made the strongest impression – strikes me as a person with a most extreme thirst for vengeance, who sees satisfaction nearby and drinks it down &lt;em&gt;already in imagination&lt;/em&gt; so fully, thoroughly and to the last drop that a tremendous, quick nausea follows this quick excess and he now rises ‘above himself’, as they say, and forgives his enemy, indeed blesses and honours him. With this rape of himself, with this mockery of his drive for revenge he only gives in to the new drive which just now has become powerful in him (disgust), and he does so just as impatiently and excessively as just a moment ago he imaginatively &lt;em&gt;anticipated&lt;/em&gt; and, as it were, exhausted his delight in revenge. Magnanimity has the same degree of egoism as revenge, only egoism of a different quality.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Again a Mouse&#xA;Mouse&#xA;Background Information:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;These stories are biographical narrations by the author, written down around 20 years ago. This was originally meant to be published as a book, but after completing the first eight chapters, the author chose not to continue, and thus we are left with the stories in their present incomplete form. Most of these stories took place around 1970. The areas discussed in these stories have changed greatly in the last 40 years and may not match what we see today. All of these stories are factual. There is no plan to ever publish this book, so if you want to know more, or if you want to know about other events that occurred, you would have to meet the author personally.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Although there is hardly any department of learning which has not received new light and new life from the ancient literature of India, yet nowhere is the light that comes to us from India so important, so novel, and so rich as in the study of religion and mythology. It is to this subject therefore that I mean to devote the remaining lectures of this course. I do so, partly because I feel myself most at home in that ancient world of Vedic literature in which the germs of Aryan religion have to be studied, partly because I believe that for a proper understanding of the deepest convictions, or, if you like, the strongest prejudices of the modern Hindus, nothing is so useful as a knowledge of the Veda. It is perfectly true that nothing would give a falser impression of the actual Brahmanical religion than the ancient Vedic literature, supposing we were to imagine that three thousand years could have passed over India without producing any change. Such a mistake would be nearly as absurd as to deny any difference between the Vedic Sanskrit and the spoken Bengali. But no one will gain a scholarlike knowledge or a true insight into the secret springs of Bengali who is ignorant of the grammar of Sanskrit; and no one will ever understand the present religious, philosophical, legal, and social opinions of the Hindus who is unable to trace them back to their true sources in the Veda.[162]&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;—In this place I can’t permit myself to omit a psychology of “belief,” of the “believer,” for the special benefit of “believers.” If there remain any today who do not yet know how &lt;em&gt;indecent&lt;/em&gt; it is to be “believing”—&lt;em&gt;or&lt;/em&gt; how much a sign of &lt;em&gt;décadence&lt;/em&gt;, of a broken will to live—then they will know it well enough tomorrow. My voice reaches even the deaf.—It appears, unless I have been incorrectly informed, that there prevails among Christians a sort of criterion of truth that is called “proof by power.” “Faith makes blessed: &lt;em&gt;therefore&lt;/em&gt; it is true.”—It might be objected right here that blessedness is not demonstrated, it is merely &lt;em&gt;promised&lt;/em&gt;: it hangs upon “faith” as a condition—one &lt;em&gt;shall&lt;/em&gt; be blessed &lt;em&gt;because&lt;/em&gt; one believes&amp;hellip;. But what of the thing that the priest promises to the believer, the wholly transcendental “beyond”—how is &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; to be demonstrated?—The “proof by power,” thus assumed, is actually no more at bottom than a belief that the effects which faith promises will not fail to appear. In a formula: “I believe that faith makes for blessedness—&lt;em&gt;therefore&lt;/em&gt;, it is true.”&amp;hellip; But this is as far as we may go. This “therefore” would be &lt;em&gt;absurdum&lt;/em&gt; itself as a criterion of truth.—But let us admit, for the sake of politeness, that blessedness by faith may be demonstrated (—&lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; merely hoped for, and &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; merely promised by the suspicious lips of a priest): even so, &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; blessedness—in a technical term, &lt;em&gt;pleasure&lt;/em&gt;—ever be a proof of truth? So little is this true that it is almost a proof against truth when sensations of pleasure influence the answer to the question “What is true?” or, at all events, it is enough to make that “truth” highly suspicious. The proof by “pleasure” is a proof &lt;em&gt;of&lt;/em&gt; “pleasure”—nothing more; why in the world should it be assumed that &lt;em&gt;true&lt;/em&gt; judgments give more pleasure than false ones, and that, in conformity to some pre-established harmony, they necessarily bring agreeable feelings in their train?—The experience of all disciplined and profound minds teaches &lt;em&gt;the contrary&lt;/em&gt;. Man has had to fight for every atom of the truth, and has had to pay for it almost everything that the heart, that human love, that human trust cling to. Greatness of soul is needed for this business: the service of truth is the hardest of all services.—What, then, is the meaning of &lt;em&gt;integrity&lt;/em&gt; in things intellectual? It means that a man must be severe with his own heart, that he must scorn “beautiful feelings,” and that he makes every Yea and Nay a matter of conscience!—Faith makes blessed: &lt;em&gt;therefore&lt;/em&gt;, it lies&amp;hellip;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The argument from growing solitary.&lt;/em&gt; – The reproach of conscience is weak in even the most conscientious people compared to the feeling: ‘This or that is against the morals (&lt;em&gt;die gute Sitte&lt;/em&gt;) of &lt;em&gt;your&lt;/em&gt; society.’ Even the strongest person still &lt;em&gt;fears&lt;/em&gt; a cold look or a sneer on the face of those among whom and for whom he has been brought up. What is he really afraid of? Growing solitary! This is the argument that refutes even the best arguments for a person or a cause. – Thus the herd instinct speaks out in us.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The fact that faith, under certain circumstances, may work for blessedness, but that this blessedness produced by an &lt;em&gt;idée fixe&lt;/em&gt; by no means makes the idea itself true, and the fact that faith actually moves no mountains, but instead &lt;em&gt;raises them up&lt;/em&gt; where there were none before: all this is made sufficiently clear by a walk through a &lt;em&gt;lunatic asylum&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;em&gt;Not&lt;/em&gt;, of course, to a priest: for his instincts prompt him to the lie that sickness is not sickness and lunatic asylums not lunatic asylums. Christianity finds sickness &lt;em&gt;necessary&lt;/em&gt;, just as the Greek spirit had need of a superabundance of health—the actual ulterior purpose of the whole system of salvation of the church is to &lt;em&gt;make&lt;/em&gt; people ill. And the church itself—doesn’t it set up a Catholic lunatic asylum as the ultimate ideal?—The whole earth as a madhouse?—The sort of religious man that the church &lt;em&gt;wants&lt;/em&gt; is a typical &lt;em&gt;décadent&lt;/em&gt;; the moment at which a religious crisis dominates a people is always marked by epidemics of nervous disorder; the “inner world” of the religious man is so much like the “inner world” of the overstrung and exhausted that it is difficult to distinguish between them; the “highest” states of mind, held up before mankind by Christianity as of supreme worth, are actually epileptoid in form—the church has granted the name of holy only to lunatics or to gigantic frauds &lt;em&gt;in majorem dei honorem&lt;/em&gt;&amp;hellip;. Once I ventured to designate the whole Christian system of &lt;em&gt;training&lt;/em&gt;[22] in penance and salvation (now best studied in England) as a method of producing a &lt;em&gt;folie circulaire&lt;/em&gt; upon a soil already prepared for it, which is to say, a soil thoroughly unhealthy. Not every one may be a Christian: one is not “converted” to Christianity—one must first be sick enough for it&amp;hellip;. We others, who have the &lt;em&gt;courage&lt;/em&gt; for health &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; likewise for contempt,—we may well despise a religion that teaches misunderstanding of the body! that refuses to rid itself of the superstition about the soul! that makes a “virtue” of insufficient nourishment! that combats health as a sort of enemy, devil, temptation! that persuades itself that it is possible to carry about a “perfect soul” in a cadaver of a body, and that, to this end, had to devise for itself a new concept of “perfection,” a pale, sickly, idiotically ecstatic state of existence, so-called “holiness”—a holiness that is itself merely a series of symptoms of an impoverished, enervated and incurably disordered body!&amp;hellip; The Christian movement, as a European movement, was from the start no more than a general uprising of all sorts of outcast and refuse elements (—who now, under cover of Christianity, aspire to power). It does &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; represent the decay of a race; it represents, on the contrary, a conglomeration of &lt;em&gt;décadence&lt;/em&gt; products from all directions, crowding together and seeking one another out. It was &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt;, as has been thought, the corruption of antiquity, of &lt;em&gt;noble&lt;/em&gt; antiquity, which made Christianity possible; one cannot too sharply challenge the learned imbecility which today maintains that theory. At the time when the sick and rotten Chandala classes in the whole &lt;em&gt;imperium&lt;/em&gt; were Christianized, the &lt;em&gt;contrary type&lt;/em&gt;, the nobility, reached its finest and ripest development. The majority became master; democracy, with its Christian instincts, &lt;em&gt;triumphed&lt;/em&gt;&amp;hellip;. Christianity was not “national,” it was not based on race—it appealed to all the varieties of men disinherited by life, it had its allies everywhere. Christianity has the rancour of the sick at its very core—the instinct against the &lt;em&gt;healthy&lt;/em&gt;, against &lt;em&gt;health&lt;/em&gt;. Everything that is well-constituted, proud, gallant and, above all, beautiful gives offence to its ears and eyes. Again I remind you of Paul’s priceless saying: “And God hath chosen the &lt;em&gt;weak&lt;/em&gt; things of the world, the &lt;em&gt;foolish&lt;/em&gt; things of the world, the &lt;em&gt;base&lt;/em&gt; things of the world, and things which are &lt;em&gt;despised&lt;/em&gt;”:[23] &lt;em&gt;this&lt;/em&gt; was the formula; &lt;em&gt;in hoc signo&lt;/em&gt; the &lt;em&gt;décadence&lt;/em&gt; triumphed.—&lt;em&gt;God on the cross&lt;/em&gt;—is man always to miss the frightful inner significance of this symbol?—Everything that suffers, everything that hangs on the cross, is &lt;em&gt;divine&lt;/em&gt;&amp;hellip;. We all hang on the cross, consequently &lt;em&gt;we&lt;/em&gt; are divine&amp;hellip;. We alone are divine&amp;hellip;. Christianity was thus a victory: a nobler attitude of mind was destroyed by it—Christianity remains to this day the greatest misfortune of humanity.—&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The sense of truth.&lt;/em&gt; – I approve of any form of scepticism to which I can reply, ‘Let’s try it!’ But I want to hear nothing more about all the things and questions that don’t admit of experiment. This is the limit of my ‘sense of truth’; for there, courage has lost its right.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Christianity also stands in opposition to all &lt;em&gt;intellectual&lt;/em&gt; well-being,—sick reasoning is the only sort that it &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; use as Christian reasoning; it takes the side of everything that is idiotic; it pronounces a curse upon “intellect,” upon the &lt;em&gt;superbia&lt;/em&gt; of the healthy intellect. Since sickness is inherent in Christianity, it follows that the typically Christian state of “faith” &lt;em&gt;must&lt;/em&gt; be a form of sickness too, and that all straight, straightforward and scientific paths to knowledge &lt;em&gt;must&lt;/em&gt; be banned by the church as &lt;em&gt;forbidden&lt;/em&gt; ways. Doubt is thus a sin from the start&amp;hellip;. The complete lack of psychological cleanliness in the priest—revealed by a glance at him—is a phenomenon &lt;em&gt;resulting&lt;/em&gt; from &lt;em&gt;décadence&lt;/em&gt;,—one may observe in hysterical women and in rachitic children how regularly the falsification of instincts, delight in lying for the mere sake of lying, and incapacity for looking straight and walking straight are symptoms of &lt;em&gt;décadence&lt;/em&gt;. “Faith” means the will to avoid knowing what is true. The pietist, the priest of either sex, is a fraud &lt;em&gt;because&lt;/em&gt; he is sick: his instinct &lt;em&gt;demands&lt;/em&gt; that the truth shall never be allowed its rights on any point. “Whatever makes for illness is &lt;em&gt;good&lt;/em&gt;; whatever issues from abundance, from superabundance, from power, is &lt;em&gt;evil&lt;/em&gt;”: so argues the believer. The &lt;em&gt;impulse to lie&lt;/em&gt;—it is by this that I recognize every foreordained theologian.—Another characteristic of the theologian is his &lt;em&gt;unfitness for philology&lt;/em&gt;. What I here mean by philology is, in a general sense, the art of reading with profit—the capacity for absorbing facts &lt;em&gt;without&lt;/em&gt; interpreting them falsely, and &lt;em&gt;without&lt;/em&gt; losing caution, patience and subtlety in the effort to understand them. Philology as &lt;em&gt;ephexis&lt;/em&gt;[24] in interpretation: whether one be dealing with books, with newspaper reports, with the most fateful events or with weather statistics—not to mention the “salvation of the soul.”&amp;hellip; The way in which a theologian, whether in Berlin or in Rome, is ready to explain, say, a “passage of Scripture,” or an experience, or a victory by the national army, by turning upon it the high illumination of the Psalms of David, is always so &lt;em&gt;daring&lt;/em&gt; that it is enough to make a philologian run up a wall. But what shall he do when pietists and other such cows from Suabia[25] use the “finger of God” to convert their miserably commonplace and huggermugger existence into a miracle of “grace,” a “providence” and an “experience of salvation”? The most modest exercise of the intellect, not to say of decency, should certainly be enough to convince these interpreters of the perfect childishness and unworthiness of such a misuse of the divine digital dexterity. However small our piety, if we ever encountered a god who always cured us of a cold in the head at just the right time, or got us into our carriage at the very instant heavy rain began to fall, he would seem so absurd a god that he’d have to be abolished even if he existed. God as a domestic servant, as a letter carrier, as an almanac-man—at bottom, he is a mere name for the stupidest sort of chance&amp;hellip;. “Divine Providence,” which every third man in “educated Germany” still believes in, is so strong an argument against God that it would be impossible to think of a stronger. And in any case it is an argument against Germans!&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;What others know about us.&lt;/em&gt; – What we know about ourselves and remember is not as decisive to our life’s happiness as it is believed to be. One day, what &lt;em&gt;others&lt;/em&gt; know (or think they know) about us assails us – and then we realize that that is more powerful. It is easier to deal with a bad conscience than a bad reputation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;—It is so little true that &lt;em&gt;martyrs&lt;/em&gt; offer any support to the truth of a cause that I am inclined to deny that any martyr has ever had anything to do with the truth at all. In the very tone in which a martyr flings what he fancies to be true at the head of the world there appears so low a grade of intellectual honesty and such &lt;em&gt;insensibility&lt;/em&gt; to the problem of “truth,” that it is never necessary to refute him. Truth is not something that one man has and another man has not: at best, only peasants, or peasant-apostles like Luther, can think of truth in any such way. One may rest assured that the greater the degree of a man’s intellectual conscience the greater will be his modesty, his &lt;em&gt;discretion&lt;/em&gt;, on this point. To &lt;em&gt;know&lt;/em&gt; in five cases, and to refuse, with delicacy, to know anything &lt;em&gt;further&lt;/em&gt;&amp;hellip;. “Truth,” as the word is understood by every prophet, every sectarian, every free-thinker, every Socialist and every churchman, is simply a complete proof that not even a beginning has been made in the intellectual discipline and self-control that are necessary to the unearthing of even the smallest truth.—The deaths of the martyrs, it may be said in passing, have been misfortunes of history: they have &lt;em&gt;misled&lt;/em&gt;&amp;hellip;. The conclusion that all idiots, women and plebeians come to, that there must be something in a cause for which any one goes to his death (or which, as under primitive Christianity, sets off epidemics of death-seeking)—this conclusion has been an unspeakable drag upon the testing of facts, upon the whole spirit of inquiry and investigation. The martyrs have &lt;em&gt;damaged&lt;/em&gt; the truth&amp;hellip;. Even to this day the crude fact of persecution is enough to give an honourable name to the most empty sort of sectarianism.—But why? Is the worth of a cause altered by the fact that some one had laid down his life for it?—An error that becomes honourable is simply an error that has acquired one seductive charm the more: do you suppose, Messrs. Theologians, that we shall give you the chance to be martyred for your lies?—One best disposes of a cause by respectfully putting it on ice—that is also the best way to dispose of theologians&amp;hellip;. This was precisely the world-historical stupidity of all the persecutors: that they gave the appearance of honour to the cause they opposed—that they made it a present of the fascination of martyrdom&amp;hellip;. Women are still on their knees before an error because they have been told that some one died on the cross for it. &lt;em&gt;Is the cross, then, an argument?&lt;/em&gt;—But about all these things there is one, and one only, who has said what has been needed for thousands of years—&lt;em&gt;Zarathustra&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Where the good begins.&lt;/em&gt; – At the point where the poor power of the eye is no longer able to see the evil drive as such, owing to its increasing subtlety, man posits the realm of goodness; and the feeling of now having stepped into the land of goodness excites all those impulses that had been threatened and limited by the evil drive, such as the feeling of security, of comfort, of benevolence. So: the duller the eye, the more extensive the good! Hence the eternal cheerfulness of the common people and of children! Hence the gloominess and grief – akin to a bad conscience – of the great thinkers!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Do not let yourself be deceived: great intellects are sceptical. Zarathustra is a sceptic. The strength, the &lt;em&gt;freedom&lt;/em&gt; which proceed from intellectual power, from a superabundance of intellectual power, &lt;em&gt;manifest&lt;/em&gt; themselves as scepticism. Men of fixed convictions do not count when it comes to determining what is fundamental in values and lack of values. Men of convictions are prisoners. They do not see far enough, they do not see what is &lt;em&gt;below&lt;/em&gt; them: whereas a man who would talk to any purpose about value and non-value must be able to see five hundred convictions &lt;em&gt;beneath&lt;/em&gt; him—and &lt;em&gt;behind&lt;/em&gt; him&amp;hellip;. A mind that aspires to great things, and that wills the means thereto, is necessarily sceptical. Freedom from any sort of conviction &lt;em&gt;belongs&lt;/em&gt; to strength, and to an independent point of view&amp;hellip;. That grand passion which is at once the foundation and the power of a sceptic’s existence, and is both more enlightened and more despotic than he is himself, drafts the whole of his intellect into its service; it makes him unscrupulous; it gives him courage to employ unholy means; under certain circumstances it does not &lt;em&gt;begrudge&lt;/em&gt; him even convictions. Conviction as a means: one may achieve a good deal by means of a conviction. A grand passion makes use of and uses up convictions; it does not yield to them—it knows itself to be sovereign.—On the contrary, the need of faith, of something unconditioned by yea or nay, of Carlylism, if I may be allowed the word, is a need of &lt;em&gt;weakness&lt;/em&gt;. The man of faith, the “believer” of any sort, is necessarily a dependent man—such a man cannot posit &lt;em&gt;himself&lt;/em&gt; as a goal, nor can he find goals within himself. The “believer” does not belong to himself; he can only be a means to an end; he must be &lt;em&gt;used up&lt;/em&gt;; he needs some one to use him up. His instinct gives the highest honours to an ethic of self-effacement; he is prompted to embrace it by everything: his prudence, his experience, his vanity. Every sort of faith is in itself an evidence of self-effacement, of self-estrangement&amp;hellip;. When one reflects how necessary it is to the great majority that there be regulations to restrain them from without and hold them fast, and to what extent control, or, in a higher sense, &lt;em&gt;slavery&lt;/em&gt;, is the one and only condition which makes for the well-being of the weak-willed man, and especially woman, then one at once understands conviction and “faith.” To the man with convictions they are his backbone. To &lt;em&gt;avoid&lt;/em&gt; seeing many things, to be impartial about nothing, to be a party man through and through, to estimate all values strictly and infallibly—these are conditions necessary to the existence of such a man. But by the same token they are &lt;em&gt;antagonists&lt;/em&gt; of the truthful man—of the truth&amp;hellip;. The believer is not free to answer the question, “true” or “not true,” according to the dictates of his own conscience: integrity on &lt;em&gt;this&lt;/em&gt; point would work his instant downfall. The pathological limitations of his vision turn the man of convictions into a fanatic—Savonarola, Luther, Rousseau, Robespierre, Saint-Simon—these types stand in opposition to the strong, &lt;em&gt;emancipated&lt;/em&gt; spirit. But the grandiose attitudes of these &lt;em&gt;sick&lt;/em&gt; intellects, these intellectual epileptics, are of influence upon the great masses—fanatics are picturesque, and mankind prefers observing poses to listening to &lt;em&gt;reasons&lt;/em&gt;&amp;hellip;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The consciousness of appearance.&lt;/em&gt; – How wonderful and new and yet how fearful and ironic my new insight makes me feel towards all of existence! I have &lt;em&gt;discovered&lt;/em&gt; for myself that the ancient humanity and animality, indeed the whole prehistory and past of all sentient being, continues within me to fabulate, to love, to hate, and to infer – I suddenly awoke in the middle of this dream, but only to the consciousness that I am dreaming and that I &lt;em&gt;must&lt;/em&gt; go on dreaming lest I perish – as the sleepwalker has to go on dreaming in order to avoid falling down. What is ‘appearance’ to me now! Certainly not the opposite of some essence – what could I say about any essence except name the predicates of its appearance! Certainly not a dead mask that one could put on an unknown x and probably also take off x! To me, appearance is the active and living itself, which goes so far in its self-mockery that it makes me feel that here there is appearance and a will-o’-the-wisp and a dance of spirits and nothing else – that among all these dreamers, even I, the ‘knower’, am dancing my dance; that the one who comes to know is a means of prolonging the earthly dance and thus is one of the masters of ceremony of existence, and that the sublime consistency and interrelatedness of all knowledge may be and will be the highest means to &lt;em&gt;sustain&lt;/em&gt; the universality of dreaming, the mutual comprehension of all dreamers, and thereby also &lt;em&gt;the duration of the dream.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <guid>https://vishvAsa.github.io/english/prose/nietzsche/anti-christ/55/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;—One step further in the psychology of conviction, of “faith.” It is now a good while since I first proposed for consideration the question whether convictions are not even more dangerous enemies to truth than lies. (“Human, All-Too-Human,” I, aphorism 483.)[27] This time I desire to put the question definitely: is there any actual difference between a lie and a conviction?—All the world believes that there is; but what is not believed by all the world!—Every conviction has its history, its primitive forms, its stage of tentativeness and error: it &lt;em&gt;becomes&lt;/em&gt; a conviction only after having been, for a long time, &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; one, and then, for an even longer time, &lt;em&gt;hardly&lt;/em&gt; one. What if falsehood be also one of these embryonic forms of conviction?—Sometimes all that is needed is a change in persons: what was a lie in the father becomes a conviction in the son.—I call it lying to refuse to see what one sees, or to refuse to see it &lt;em&gt;as&lt;/em&gt; it is: whether the lie be uttered before witnesses or not before witnesses is of no consequence. The most common sort of lie is that by which a man deceives himself: the deception of others is a relatively rare offence.—Now, this will &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; to see what one sees, this will &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; to see it as it is, is almost the first requisite for all who belong to a party of whatever sort: the party man becomes inevitably a liar. For example, the German historians are convinced that Rome was synonymous with despotism and that the Germanic peoples brought the spirit of liberty into the world: what is the difference between this conviction and a lie? Is it to be wondered at that all partisans, including the German historians, instinctively roll the fine phrases of morality upon their tongues—that morality almost owes its very &lt;em&gt;survival&lt;/em&gt; to the fact that the party man of every sort has need of it every moment?—“This is &lt;em&gt;our&lt;/em&gt; conviction: we publish it to the whole world; we live and die for it—let us respect all who have convictions!”—I have actually heard such sentiments from the mouths of anti-Semites. On the contrary, gentlemen! An anti-Semite surely does not become more respectable because he lies on principle&amp;hellip;. The priests, who have more finesse in such matters, and who well understand the objection that lies against the notion of a conviction, which is to say, of a falsehood that becomes a matter of principle &lt;em&gt;because&lt;/em&gt; it serves a purpose, have borrowed from the Jews the shrewd device of sneaking in the concepts, “God,” “the will of God” and “the revelation of God” at this place. Kant, too, with his categorical imperative, was on the same road: this was his &lt;em&gt;practical&lt;/em&gt; reason.[28] There are questions regarding the truth or untruth of which it is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; for man to decide; all the capital questions, all the capital problems of valuation, are beyond human reason&amp;hellip;. To know the limits of reason—&lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; alone is genuine philosophy&amp;hellip;. Why did God make a revelation to man? Would God have done anything superfluous? Man &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; not find out for himself what was good and what was evil, so God taught him His will&amp;hellip;. Moral: the priest does &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; lie—the question, “true” or “untrue,” has nothing to do with such things as the priest discusses; it is impossible to lie about these things. In order to lie here it would be necessary to know &lt;em&gt;what&lt;/em&gt; is true. But this is more than man &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; know; therefore, the priest is simply the mouthpiece of God.—Such a priestly syllogism is by no means merely Jewish and Christian; the right to lie and the &lt;em&gt;shrewd dodge&lt;/em&gt; of “revelation” belong to the general priestly type—to the priest of the &lt;em&gt;décadence&lt;/em&gt; as well as to the priest of pagan times (—Pagans are all those who say yes to life, and to whom “God” is a word signifying acquiescence in all things).—The “law,” the “will of God,” the “holy book,” and “inspiration”—all these things are merely words for the conditions &lt;em&gt;under&lt;/em&gt; which the priest comes to power and &lt;em&gt;with&lt;/em&gt; which he maintains his power,—these concepts are to be found at the bottom of all priestly organizations, and of all priestly or priestly-philosophical schemes of governments. The “holy lie”—common alike to Confucius, to the Code of Manu, to Mohammed and to the Christian church—is not even wanting in Plato. “Truth is here”: this means, no matter where it is heard, &lt;em&gt;the priest lies&lt;/em&gt;&amp;hellip;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The ultimate noblemindedness.&lt;/em&gt; – So what makes a person ‘noble’? Certainly not making sacrifices; even those burning with lust make sacrifices. Certainly not following some passion, for there are contemptible passions. Certainly not that one does something for others without selfishness: perhaps no one is more consistently selfish than the noble one. – Rather, the passion that overcomes the noble one is a singularity, and he fails to realize this: the use of a rare and singular standard and almost a madness; the feeling of heat in things that feel cold to everyone else; a hitting upon values for which the scale has not yet been invented; a sacrifice on altars made for an unknown god; a courage without any desire for honours; a self-sufficiency that overflows and communicates to men and things. Hitherto, then, it was rarity and the unawareness of this rarity that made noble. Note, however, that by means of this standard everything usual, near, and indispensable, in short, that which most preserved the species, and in general the &lt;em&gt;rule&lt;/em&gt; of humanity hitherto, was inequitably judged and on the whole slandered in favour of the exceptions. To become the advocate of the rule – that might be the ultimate form and refinement in which noblemindedness manifests itself on earth.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;—In the last analysis it comes to this: what is the &lt;em&gt;end&lt;/em&gt; of lying? The fact that, in Christianity, “holy” ends are not visible is &lt;em&gt;my&lt;/em&gt; objection to the means it employs. Only &lt;em&gt;bad&lt;/em&gt; ends appear: the poisoning, the calumniation, the denial of life, the despising of the body, the degradation and self-contamination of man by the concept of sin—&lt;em&gt;therefore&lt;/em&gt;, its means are also bad.—I have a contrary feeling when I read the Code of Manu, an incomparably more intellectual and superior work, which it would be a sin against the &lt;em&gt;intelligence&lt;/em&gt; to so much as &lt;em&gt;name&lt;/em&gt; in the same breath with the Bible. It is easy to see why: there is a genuine philosophy behind it, &lt;em&gt;in&lt;/em&gt; it, not merely an evil-smelling mess of Jewish rabbinism and superstition,—it gives even the most fastidious psychologist something to sink his teeth into. And, &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; to forget what is most important, it differs fundamentally from every kind of Bible: by means of it the &lt;em&gt;nobles&lt;/em&gt;, the philosophers and the warriors keep the whip-hand over the majority; it is full of noble valuations, it shows a feeling of perfection, an acceptance of life, and triumphant feeling toward self and life—the &lt;em&gt;sun&lt;/em&gt; shines upon the whole book.—All the things on which Christianity vents its fathomless vulgarity—for example, procreation, women and marriage—are here handled earnestly, with reverence and with love and confidence. How can any one really put into the hands of children and ladies a book which contains such vile things as this: “to avoid fornication, let every man have his own wife, and let every woman have her own husband; &amp;hellip; it is better to marry than to burn”?[29] And is it &lt;em&gt;possible&lt;/em&gt; to be a Christian so long as the origin of man is Christianized, which is to say, &lt;em&gt;befouled&lt;/em&gt;, by the doctrine of the &lt;em&gt;immaculata conceptio&lt;/em&gt;?&amp;hellip; I know of no book in which so many delicate and kindly things are said of women as in the Code of Manu; these old grey-beards and saints have a way of being gallant to women that it would be impossible, perhaps, to surpass. “The mouth of a woman,” it says in one place, “the breasts of a maiden, the prayer of a child and the smoke of sacrifice are always pure.” In another place: “there is nothing purer than the light of the sun, the shadow cast by a cow, air, water, fire and the breath of a maiden.” Finally, in still another place—perhaps this is also a holy lie—: “all the orifices of the body above the navel are pure, and all below are impure. Only in the maiden is the whole body pure.”&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The desire for suffering.&lt;/em&gt; – When I think of the desire to do something, how it continually tickles and goads the millions of young Europeans who cannot endure boredom and themselves, I realize that they must have a yearning to suffer something in order to make their suffering a likely reason for action, for deeds. Neediness is needed! Hence the clamour of the politicians; hence the many false, fictitious, exaggerated ‘emergencies’ of all kinds and the blind readiness to believe in them. This young world demands that not happiness, but unhappiness should approach or become visible &lt;em&gt;from outside;&lt;/em&gt; and its imagination is already busy turning this unhappiness into a monster ahead of time so that afterwards it can fight a monster. Were these distress-addicts to feel within themselves the power to do themselves good from within, to do something for themselves, they would know how to create their very own distress. Their inventions could then become more refined and their satisfactions sound like good music, while they now fill the world with their clamour about distress, and consequently, all too often with the &lt;em&gt;feeling of distress!&lt;/em&gt; They do not know what to do with themselves – and so they paint the unhappiness of others on the wall; they always need others! And continually other others! – Pardon me, my friends, I have ventured to paint my &lt;em&gt;happiness&lt;/em&gt; on the wall.35&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;One catches the &lt;em&gt;unholiness&lt;/em&gt; of Christian means &lt;em&gt;in flagranti&lt;/em&gt; by the simple process of putting the ends sought by Christianity beside the ends sought by the Code of Manu—by putting these enormously antithetical ends under a strong light. The critic of Christianity cannot evade the necessity of making Christianity &lt;em&gt;contemptible&lt;/em&gt;.—A book of laws such as the Code of Manu has the same origin as every other good law-book: it epitomizes the experience, the sagacity and the ethical experimentation of long centuries; it brings things to a conclusion; it no longer creates. The prerequisite to a codification of this sort is recognition of the fact that the means which establish the authority of a slowly and painfully attained &lt;em&gt;truth&lt;/em&gt; are fundamentally different from those which one would make use of to prove it. A law-book never recites the utility, the grounds, the casuistical antecedents of a law: for if it did so it would lose the imperative tone, the “thou shall,” on which obedience is based. The problem lies exactly here.—At a certain point in the evolution of a people, the class within it of the greatest insight, which is to say, the greatest hindsight and foresight, declares that the series of experiences determining how all shall live—or &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; live—has come to an end. The object now is to reap as rich and as complete a harvest as possible from the days of experiment and &lt;em&gt;hard&lt;/em&gt; experience. In consequence, the thing that is to be avoided above everything is further experimentation—the continuation of the state in which values are fluent, and are tested, chosen and criticized &lt;em&gt;ad infinitum&lt;/em&gt;. Against this a double wall is set up: on the one hand, &lt;em&gt;revelation&lt;/em&gt;, which is the assumption that the reasons lying behind the laws are &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; of human origin, that they were &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; sought out and found by a slow process and after many errors, but that they are of divine ancestry, and came into being complete, perfect, without a history, as a free gift, a miracle&amp;hellip;; and on the other hand, &lt;em&gt;tradition&lt;/em&gt;, which is the assumption that the law has stood unchanged from time immemorial, and that it is impious and a crime against one’s forefathers to bring it into question. The authority of the law is thus grounded on the thesis: God gave it, and the fathers &lt;em&gt;lived&lt;/em&gt; it.—The higher motive of such procedure lies in the design to distract consciousness, step by step, from its concern with notions of right living (that is to say, those that have been &lt;em&gt;proved&lt;/em&gt; to be right by wide and carefully considered experience), so that instinct attains to a perfect automatism—a primary necessity to every sort of mastery, to every sort of perfection in the art of life. To draw up such a law-book as Manu’s means to lay before a people the possibility of future mastery, of attainable perfection—it permits them to aspire to the highest reaches of the art of life. &lt;em&gt;To that end the thing must be made unconscious&lt;/em&gt;: that is the aim of every holy lie.—The &lt;em&gt;order of castes&lt;/em&gt;, the highest, the dominating law, is merely the ratification of an &lt;em&gt;order of nature&lt;/em&gt;, of a natural law of the first rank, over which no arbitrary fiat, no “modern idea,” can exert any influence. In every healthy society there are three physiological types, gravitating toward differentiation but mutually conditioning one another, and each of these has its own hygiene, its own sphere of work, its own special mastery and feeling of perfection. It is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; Manu but nature that sets off in one class those who are chiefly intellectual, in another those who are marked by muscular strength and temperament, and in a third those who are distinguished in neither one way or the other, but show only mediocrity—the last-named represents the great majority, and the first two the select. The superior caste—I call it the &lt;em&gt;fewest&lt;/em&gt;—has, as the most perfect, the privileges of the few: it stands for happiness, for beauty, for everything good upon earth. Only the most intellectual of men have any right to beauty, to the beautiful; only in them can goodness escape being weakness. &lt;em&gt;Pulchrum est paucorum hominum&lt;/em&gt;:[30] goodness is a privilege. Nothing could be more unbecoming to them than uncouth manners or a pessimistic look, or an eye that sees &lt;em&gt;ugliness&lt;/em&gt;—or indignation against the general aspect of things. Indignation is the privilege of the Chandala; so is pessimism. “&lt;em&gt;The world is perfect&lt;/em&gt;”—so prompts the instinct of the intellectual, the instinct of the man who says yes to life. “Imperfection, whatever is &lt;em&gt;inferior&lt;/em&gt; to us, distance, the pathos of distance, even the Chandala themselves are parts of this perfection.” The most intelligent men, like the &lt;em&gt;strongest&lt;/em&gt;, find their happiness where others would find only disaster: in the labyrinth, in being hard with themselves and with others, in effort; their delight is in self-mastery; in them asceticism becomes second nature, a necessity, an instinct. They regard a difficult task as a privilege; it is to them a &lt;em&gt;recreation&lt;/em&gt; to play with burdens that would crush all others&amp;hellip;. Knowledge—a form of asceticism.—They are the most honourable kind of men: but that does not prevent them being the most cheerful and most amiable. They rule, not because they want to, but because they &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt;; they are not at liberty to play second.—The &lt;em&gt;second caste&lt;/em&gt;: to this belong the guardians of the law, the keepers of order and security, the more noble warriors, above all, the king as the highest form of warrior, judge and preserver of the law. The second in rank constitute the executive arm of the intellectuals, the next to them in rank, taking from them all that is &lt;em&gt;rough&lt;/em&gt; in the business of ruling—their followers, their right hand, their most apt disciples.—In all this, I repeat, there is nothing arbitrary, nothing “made up”; whatever is to the &lt;em&gt;contrary&lt;/em&gt; is made up—by it nature is brought to shame&amp;hellip;. The order of castes, the &lt;em&gt;order of rank&lt;/em&gt;, simply formulates the supreme law of life itself; the separation of the three types is necessary to the maintenance of society, and to the evolution of higher types, and the highest types—the &lt;em&gt;inequality&lt;/em&gt; of rights is essential to the existence of any rights at all.—A right is a privilege. Every one enjoys the privileges that accord with his state of existence. Let us not underestimate the privileges of the &lt;em&gt;mediocre&lt;/em&gt;. Life is always harder as one mounts the &lt;em&gt;heights&lt;/em&gt;—the cold increases, responsibility increases. A high civilization is a pyramid: it can stand only on a broad base; its primary prerequisite is a strong and soundly consolidated mediocrity. The handicrafts, commerce, agriculture, &lt;em&gt;science&lt;/em&gt;, the greater part of art, in brief, the whole range of &lt;em&gt;occupational&lt;/em&gt; activities, are compatible only with mediocre ability and aspiration; such callings would be out of place for exceptional men; the instincts which belong to them stand as much opposed to aristocracy as to anarchism. The fact that a man is publicly useful, that he is a wheel, a function, is evidence of a natural predisposition; it is not &lt;em&gt;society&lt;/em&gt;, but the only sort of happiness that the majority are capable of, that makes them intelligent machines. To the mediocre mediocrity is a form of happiness; they have a natural instinct for mastering one thing, for specialization. It would be altogether unworthy of a profound intellect to see anything objectionable in mediocrity in itself. It is, in fact, the &lt;em&gt;first&lt;/em&gt; prerequisite to the appearance of the exceptional: it is a necessary condition to a high degree of civilization. When the exceptional man handles the mediocre man with more delicate fingers than he applies to himself or to his equals, this is not merely kindness of heart—it is simply his &lt;em&gt;duty&lt;/em&gt;&amp;hellip;. Whom do I hate most heartily among the rabbles of today? The rabble of Socialists, the apostles to the Chandala, who undermine the workingman’s instincts, his pleasure, his feeling of contentment with his petty existence—who make him envious and teach him revenge&amp;hellip;. Wrong never lies in unequal rights; it lies in the assertion of “equal” rights&amp;hellip;. What is &lt;em&gt;bad&lt;/em&gt;? But I have already answered: all that proceeds from weakness, from envy, from &lt;em&gt;revenge&lt;/em&gt;.—The anarchist and the Christian have the same ancestry&amp;hellip;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In point of fact, the end for which one lies makes a great difference: whether one preserves thereby or destroys. There is a perfect likeness between Christian and anarchist: their object, their instinct, points only toward destruction. One need only turn to history for a proof of this: there it appears with appalling distinctness. We have just studied a code of religious legislation whose object it was to convert the conditions which cause life to &lt;em&gt;flourish&lt;/em&gt; into an “eternal” social organization,—Christianity found its mission in putting an end to such an organization, &lt;em&gt;because life flourished under it&lt;/em&gt;. There the benefits that reason had produced during long ages of experiment and insecurity were applied to the most remote uses, and an effort was made to bring in a harvest that should be as large, as rich and as complete as possible; here, on the contrary, the harvest is &lt;em&gt;blighted&lt;/em&gt; overnight&amp;hellip;. That which stood there &lt;em&gt;aere perennis&lt;/em&gt;, the &lt;em&gt;imperium Romanum&lt;/em&gt;, the most magnificent form of organization under difficult conditions that has ever been achieved, and compared to which everything before it and after it appears as patchwork, bungling, &lt;em&gt;dilletantism&lt;/em&gt;—those holy anarchists made it a matter of “piety” to destroy “the world,” &lt;em&gt;which is to say&lt;/em&gt;, the &lt;em&gt;imperium Romanum&lt;/em&gt;, so that in the end not a stone stood upon another—and even Germans and other such louts were able to become its masters&amp;hellip;. The Christian and the anarchist: both are &lt;em&gt;décadents&lt;/em&gt;; both are incapable of any act that is not disintegrating, poisonous, degenerating, &lt;em&gt;blood-sucking&lt;/em&gt;; both have an instinct of &lt;em&gt;mortal hatred&lt;/em&gt; of everything that stands up, and is great, and has durability, and promises life a future&amp;hellip;. Christianity was the vampire of the &lt;em&gt;imperium Romanum&lt;/em&gt;,—overnight it destroyed the vast achievement of the Romans: the conquest of the soil for a great culture &lt;em&gt;that could await its time&lt;/em&gt;. Can it be that this fact is not yet understood? The &lt;em&gt;imperium Romanum&lt;/em&gt; that we know, and that the history of the Roman provinces teaches us to know better and better,—this most admirable of all works of art in the grand manner was merely the beginning, and the structure to follow was not to &lt;em&gt;prove&lt;/em&gt; its worth for thousands of years. To this day, nothing on a like scale &lt;em&gt;sub specie aeterni&lt;/em&gt; has been brought into being, or even dreamed of!—This organization was strong enough to withstand bad emperors: the accident of personality has nothing to do with such things—the &lt;em&gt;first&lt;/em&gt; principle of all genuinely great architecture. But it was not strong enough to stand up against the &lt;em&gt;corruptest&lt;/em&gt; of all forms of corruption—against Christians&amp;hellip;. These stealthy worms, which under the cover of night, mist and duplicity, crept upon every individual, sucking him dry of all earnest interest in &lt;em&gt;real&lt;/em&gt; things, of all instinct for &lt;em&gt;reality&lt;/em&gt;—this cowardly, effeminate and sugar-coated gang gradually alienated all “souls,” step by step, from that colossal edifice, turning against it all the meritorious, manly and noble natures that had found in the cause of Rome their own cause, their own serious purpose, their own &lt;em&gt;pride&lt;/em&gt;. The sneakishness of hypocrisy, the secrecy of the conventicle, concepts as black as hell, such as the sacrifice of the innocent, the &lt;em&gt;unio mystica&lt;/em&gt; in the drinking of blood, above all, the slowly rekindled fire of revenge, of Chandala revenge—all &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; sort of thing became master of Rome: the same kind of religion which, in a pre-existent form, Epicurus had combatted. One has but to read Lucretius to know &lt;em&gt;what&lt;/em&gt; Epicurus made war upon—&lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; paganism, but “Christianity,” which is to say, the corruption of souls by means of the concepts of guilt, punishment and immortality.—He combatted the &lt;em&gt;subterranean&lt;/em&gt; cults, the whole of latent Christianity—to deny immortality was already a form of genuine &lt;em&gt;salvation&lt;/em&gt;.—Epicurus had triumphed, and every respectable intellect in Rome was Epicurean—&lt;em&gt;when Paul appeared&lt;/em&gt; &amp;hellip; Paul, the Chandala hatred of Rome, of “the world,” in the flesh and inspired by genius—the Jew, the &lt;em&gt;eternal&lt;/em&gt; Jew &lt;em&gt;par excellence&lt;/em&gt;&amp;hellip;. What he saw was how, with the aid of the small sectarian Christian movement that stood apart from Judaism, a “world conflagration” might be kindled; how, with the symbol of “God on the cross,” all secret seditions, all the fruits of anarchistic intrigues in the empire, might be amalgamated into one immense power. “Salvation is of the Jews.”—Christianity is the formula for exceeding &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; summing up the subterranean cults of all varieties, that of Osiris, that of the Great Mother, that of Mithras, for instance: in his discernment of this fact the genius of Paul showed itself. His instinct was here so sure that, with reckless violence to the truth, he put the ideas which lent fascination to every sort of Chandala religion into the mouth of the “Saviour” as his own inventions, and not only into the mouth—he &lt;em&gt;made&lt;/em&gt; out of him something that even a priest of Mithras could understand&amp;hellip;. This was his revelation at Damascus: he grasped the fact that he &lt;em&gt;needed&lt;/em&gt; the belief in immortality in order to rob “the world” of its value, that the concept of “hell” would master Rome—that the notion of a “beyond” is the &lt;em&gt;death of life&lt;/em&gt;&amp;hellip;. Nihilist and Christian: they rhyme in German, and they do more than rhyme&amp;hellip;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The whole labour of the ancient world gone for &lt;em&gt;naught&lt;/em&gt;: I have no word to describe the feelings that such an enormity arouses in me.—And, considering the fact that its labour was merely preparatory, that with adamantine self-consciousness it laid only the foundations for a work to go on for thousands of years, the whole &lt;em&gt;meaning&lt;/em&gt; of antiquity disappears!&amp;hellip; To what end the Greeks? to what end the Romans?—All the prerequisites to a learned culture, all the &lt;em&gt;methods&lt;/em&gt; of science, were already there; man had already perfected the great and incomparable art of reading profitably—that first necessity to the tradition of culture, the unity of the sciences; the natural sciences, in alliance with mathematics and mechanics, were on the right road,—&lt;em&gt;the sense of fact&lt;/em&gt;, the last and more valuable of all the senses, had its schools, and its traditions were already centuries old! Is all this properly understood? Every &lt;em&gt;essential&lt;/em&gt; to the beginning of the work was ready:—and the &lt;em&gt;most&lt;/em&gt; essential, it cannot be said too often, are methods, and also the most difficult to develop, and the longest opposed by habit and laziness. What we have today reconquered, with unspeakable self-discipline, for ourselves—for certain bad instincts, certain Christian instincts, still lurk in our bodies—that is to say, the keen eye for reality, the cautious hand, patience and seriousness in the smallest things, the whole &lt;em&gt;integrity&lt;/em&gt; of knowledge—all these things were already there, and had been there for two thousand years! &lt;em&gt;More&lt;/em&gt;, there was also a refined and excellent tact and taste! &lt;em&gt;Not&lt;/em&gt; as mere brain-drilling! &lt;em&gt;Not&lt;/em&gt; as “German” culture, with its loutish manners! But as body, as bearing, as instinct—in short, as reality&amp;hellip;. &lt;em&gt;All gone for naught!&lt;/em&gt; Overnight it became merely a memory!—The Greeks! The Romans! Instinctive nobility, taste, methodical inquiry, genius for organization and administration, faith in and the &lt;em&gt;will&lt;/em&gt; to secure the future of man, a great yes to everything entering into the &lt;em&gt;imperium Romanum&lt;/em&gt; and palpable to all the senses, a grand style that was beyond mere art, but had become reality, truth, &lt;em&gt;life&lt;/em&gt;&amp;hellip;.—All overwhelmed in a night, but not by a convulsion of nature! Not trampled to death by Teutons and others of heavy hoof! But brought to shame by crafty, sneaking, invisible, anæmic vampires! Not conquered,—only sucked dry!&amp;hellip; Hidden vengefulness, petty envy, became &lt;em&gt;master&lt;/em&gt;! Everything wretched, intrinsically ailing, and invaded by bad feelings, the whole &lt;em&gt;ghetto-world&lt;/em&gt; of the soul, was at once &lt;em&gt;on top&lt;/em&gt;!—One needs but read any of the Christian agitators, for example, St. Augustine, in order to realize, in order to smell, what filthy fellows came to the top. It would be an error, however, to assume that there was any lack of understanding in the leaders of the Christian movement:—ah, but they were clever, clever to the point of holiness, these fathers of the church! What they lacked was something quite different. Nature neglected—perhaps forgot—to give them even the most modest endowment of respectable, of upright, of &lt;em&gt;cleanly&lt;/em&gt; instincts&amp;hellip;. Between ourselves, they are not even men&amp;hellip;. If Islam despises Christianity, it has a thousandfold right to do so: Islam at least assumes that it is dealing with &lt;em&gt;men&lt;/em&gt;&amp;hellip;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

This was originally meant to be published as a book, but after completing the first eight chapters, the author chose not to continue, and thus we are left with the stories in their present incomplete form. Most of these stories took place around 1970. The areas discussed in these stories have changed greatly in the last 40 years and may not match what we see today. All of these stories are factual. There is no plan to ever publish this book, so if you want to know more, or if you want to know about other events that occurred, you would have to meet the author personally.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The next important phenomenon of nature which was represented in the Veda as a terrestrial deity is Fire, in Sanskrit Agni, in Latin &lt;em&gt;ignis&lt;/em&gt;. In the worship which is paid to the Fire and in the high praises bestowed on Agni we can clearly perceive the traces of a period in the history of man in which not only the most essential comforts of life, but life itself, depended on the knowledge of producing fire. To us fire has become so familiar that we can hardly form an idea of what life would be without it. But how did the ancient dwellers on earth get command and possession of fire? The Vedic poets tell us that fire first came to them from the sky, in the form of lightning, but that it disappeared again, and that then Mātariśvan, a being to a certain extent like Prometheus, brought it back and confided it to the safe keeping of the clan of the Bhrigus (Phlegyas).&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Christianity destroyed for us the whole harvest of ancient civilization, and later it also destroyed for us the whole harvest of &lt;em&gt;Mohammedan&lt;/em&gt; civilization. The wonderful culture of the Moors in Spain, which was fundamentally nearer to &lt;em&gt;us&lt;/em&gt; and appealed more to our senses and tastes than that of Rome and Greece, was &lt;em&gt;trampled down&lt;/em&gt; (—I do not say by what sort of feet—) Why? Because it had to thank noble and manly instincts for its origin—because it said yes to life, even to the rare and refined luxuriousness of Moorish life!&amp;hellip; The crusaders later made war on something before which it would have been more fitting for them to have grovelled in the dust—a civilization beside which even that of our nineteenth century seems very poor and very “senile.”—What they wanted, of course, was booty: the orient was rich&amp;hellip;. Let us put aside our prejudices! The crusades were a higher form of piracy, nothing more! The German nobility, which is fundamentally a Viking nobility, was in its element there: the church knew only too well how the German nobility was to be &lt;em&gt;won&lt;/em&gt;&amp;hellip;. The German noble, always the “Swiss guard” of the church, always in the service of every bad instinct of the church—&lt;em&gt;but well paid&lt;/em&gt;&amp;hellip;. Consider the fact that it is precisely the aid of German swords and German blood and valour that has enabled the church to carry through its war to the death upon everything noble on earth! At this point a host of painful questions suggest themselves. The German nobility stands &lt;em&gt;outside&lt;/em&gt; the history of the higher civilization: the reason is obvious&amp;hellip;. Christianity, alcohol—the two &lt;em&gt;great&lt;/em&gt; means of corruption&amp;hellip;. Intrinsically there should be no more choice between Islam and Christianity than there is between an Arab and a Jew. The decision is already reached; nobody remains at liberty to choose here. Either a man is a Chandala or he is not&amp;hellip;. “War to the knife with Rome! Peace and friendship with Islam!”: this was the feeling, this was the &lt;em&gt;act&lt;/em&gt;, of that great free spirit, that genius among German emperors, Frederick II. What! must a German first be a genius, a free spirit, before he can feel &lt;em&gt;decently&lt;/em&gt;? I can’t make out how a German could ever feel &lt;em&gt;Christian&lt;/em&gt;&amp;hellip;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Here it becomes necessary to call up a memory that must be a hundred times more painful to Germans. The Germans have destroyed for Europe the last great harvest of civilization that Europe was ever to reap—the &lt;em&gt;Renaissance&lt;/em&gt;. Is it understood at last, &lt;em&gt;will&lt;/em&gt; it ever be understood, &lt;em&gt;what&lt;/em&gt; the Renaissance was? &lt;em&gt;The transvaluation of Christian values&lt;/em&gt;,—an attempt with all available means, all instincts and all the resources of genius to bring about a triumph of the &lt;em&gt;opposite&lt;/em&gt; values, the more &lt;em&gt;noble&lt;/em&gt; values&amp;hellip;. This has been the one great war of the past; there has never been a more critical question than that of the Renaissance—it is &lt;em&gt;my&lt;/em&gt; question too—; there has never been a form of &lt;em&gt;attack&lt;/em&gt; more fundamental, more direct, or more violently delivered by a whole front upon the center of the enemy! To attack at the critical place, at the very seat of Christianity, and there enthrone the more noble values—that is to say, to &lt;em&gt;insinuate&lt;/em&gt; them into the instincts, into the most fundamental needs and appetites of those sitting there&amp;hellip;. I see before me the &lt;em&gt;possibility&lt;/em&gt; of a perfectly heavenly enchantment and spectacle:—it seems to me to scintillate with all the vibrations of a fine and delicate beauty, and within it there is an art so divine, so infernally divine, that one might search in vain for thousands of years for another such possibility; I see a spectacle so rich in significance and at the same time so wonderfully full of paradox that it should arouse all the gods on Olympus to immortal laughter—&lt;em&gt;Cæsar Borgia as pope!&lt;/em&gt;&amp;hellip; Am I understood?&amp;hellip; Well then, &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; would have been the sort of triumph that &lt;em&gt;I&lt;/em&gt; alone am longing for today—: by it Christianity would have been &lt;em&gt;swept away&lt;/em&gt;!—What happened? A German monk, Luther, came to Rome. This monk, with all the vengeful instincts of an unsuccessful priest in him, raised a rebellion &lt;em&gt;against&lt;/em&gt; the Renaissance in Rome&amp;hellip;. Instead of grasping, with profound thanksgiving, the miracle that had taken place: the conquest of Christianity at its &lt;em&gt;capital&lt;/em&gt;—instead of this, his hatred was stimulated by the spectacle. A religious man thinks only of himself.—Luther saw only the &lt;em&gt;depravity&lt;/em&gt; of the papacy at the very moment when the opposite was becoming apparent: the old corruption, the &lt;em&gt;peccatum originale&lt;/em&gt;, Christianity itself, no longer occupied the papal chair! Instead there was life! Instead there was the triumph of life! Instead there was a great yea to all lofty, beautiful and daring things!&amp;hellip; And Luther &lt;em&gt;restored the church&lt;/em&gt;: he attacked it&amp;hellip;. The Renaissance—an event without meaning, a great futility!—Ah, these Germans, what they have not cost us! &lt;em&gt;Futility&lt;/em&gt;—that has always been the work of the Germans.—The Reformation; Leibnitz; Kant and so-called German philosophy; the war of “liberation”; the empire—every time a futile substitute for something that once existed, for something &lt;em&gt;irrecoverable&lt;/em&gt;&amp;hellip;. These Germans, I confess, are my enemies: I despise all their uncleanliness in concept and valuation, their cowardice before every honest yea and nay. For nearly a thousand years they have tangled and confused everything their fingers have touched; they have on their conscience all the half-way measures, all the three-eighths-way measures, that Europe is sick of,—they also have on their conscience the uncleanest variety of Christianity that exists, and the most incurable and indestructible—Protestantism&amp;hellip;. If mankind never manages to get rid of Christianity the &lt;em&gt;Germans&lt;/em&gt; will be to blame&amp;hellip;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <guid>https://vishvAsa.github.io/english/prose/nietzsche/anti-christ/62/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;—With this I come to a conclusion and pronounce my judgment. I &lt;em&gt;condemn&lt;/em&gt; Christianity; I bring against the Christian church the most terrible of all the accusations that an accuser has ever had in his mouth. It is, to me, the greatest of all imaginable corruptions; it seeks to work the ultimate corruption, the worst possible corruption. The Christian church has left nothing untouched by its depravity; it has turned every value into worthlessness, and every truth into a lie, and every integrity into baseness of soul. Let any one dare to speak to me of its “humanitarian” blessings! Its deepest necessities range it against any effort to abolish distress; it lives by distress; it &lt;em&gt;creates&lt;/em&gt; distress to make &lt;em&gt;itself&lt;/em&gt; immortal&amp;hellip;. For example, the worm of sin: it was the church that first enriched mankind with this misery!—The “equality of souls before God”—this fraud, this &lt;em&gt;pretext&lt;/em&gt; for the &lt;em&gt;rancunes&lt;/em&gt; of all the base-minded—this explosive concept, ending in revolution, the modern idea, and the notion of overthrowing the whole social order—this is &lt;em&gt;Christian&lt;/em&gt; dynamite&amp;hellip;. The “humanitarian” blessings of Christianity forsooth! To breed out of &lt;em&gt;humanitas&lt;/em&gt; a self-contradiction, an art of self-pollution, a will to lie at any price, an aversion and contempt for all good and honest instincts! All this, to me, is the “humanitarianism” of Christianity!—Parasitism as the &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; practice of the church; with its anæmic and “holy” ideals, sucking all the blood, all the love, all the hope out of life; the beyond as the will to deny all reality; the cross as the distinguishing mark of the most subterranean conspiracy ever heard of,—against health, beauty, well-being, intellect, &lt;em&gt;kindness&lt;/em&gt; of soul—&lt;em&gt;against life itself&lt;/em&gt;&amp;hellip;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;With and Against Sai Baba&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Chapter Seven&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The first welcome I got upon my arrival at Sai Baba’s ashram was from a large group of ragged beggars sitting outside the front gate. Past them, flocks of well-off people crowded into the compound; that meant Sai Baba was here now. I viewed this scene with decidedly mixed feelings.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;“He is supposed to be God”, I considered, “and his followers say he has the power to remove misfortune, disease and poverty – so why are these beggars loitering here just outside his own house? And if his disciples are really so blessed, why don’t they do something more for these poor people than just give them a few coins?”&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;memorization&#34;&gt;Memorization&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I do not wonder that I should have been asked by some of my hearers to devote part of my last lecture to answering the question, how the Vedic literature could have been composed and preserved, if writing was unknown in India before 500 b.c., while the hymns of the Rig-Veda are said to date from 1500 b.c. Classical scholars naturally ask what is the date of our oldest MSS. of the Rig-Veda, and what is the evidence on which so high an antiquity is assigned to its contents. I shall try to answer this question as well as I can, and I shall begin with a humble confession that the oldest MSS. of the Rig-Veda, known to us at present, date not from 1500 b.c., but from about 1500 a.d.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Odd Gods of the South&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Chapter Eight&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A day or so later I asked my friend to take me around the village. We went to the Chitravati river, but since it was the dry season there was no water, just a sand channel.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;On a rocky mound near the riverbed stood a tamarind tree from which Sai Baba is said to have magically plucked mangos and other fruits during his youth. I clambered up the rocks and sat beneath it. At the time I was not aware of the significance Sai Baba’s followers attached to this tree; I only happened to go there because it looked like a suitable spot for meditation. I sat in the lotus pose, and my friend sat next to me. With closed eyes I visualized Lord Rama, God’s avatar as the prince who defeated the demon Ravana.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

My course was cancelled, and everyone returned to their units.  However, I received special orders to stay put and await further instructions.  Two days later, my posting to Jammu and Kashmir arrived – with immediate reporting required.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Having driven my car to Mhow, I had no choice but to take it back to Punjab, leave it there, and then travel on to J&amp;amp;K.  Pressed for time, I decided to drive straight from Mhow to Delhi, a risky decision.  One particularly dangerous stretch was between Gwalior and Agra, notorious for bandits and lawlessness.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

That so many young people are unknowingly putting their lives at risk because of bad infrastructure in their hopes for a better future should make us sit up and take more notice.

All the political analysts are welcome to think about why the exit polls were misleading, and why the BJP’s campaign backfired &amp;ndash; after all, hindsight is 20-20. Among all this political punditry, there’s another kind of pundit having his say – the astrologer. There are a spate of articles examining the election results in light of Modi’s horoscope with a supposedly Scorpio ascendant. Someone even tried using I-Ching to make election predictions. But why resort to imported mumbo-jumbo when we have the home-grown variety that does the task nicely! So, here is a peek into the rich tradition of astrology and false predictions in Sanskrit literature.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The Musician who Sliced Off his Tongue to Avoid Singing in Tipu Sultan&amp;rsquo;s Durbar&lt;br&gt;&#xA;A brief episode from a Kannada novel featuring a heroic singer who defied Tipu Sultan&amp;rsquo;s authority.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;AUTHORED BY T.R. SUBBA RAO (Ta Ra Su), the Kannada novel Hamsageethe narrates the life and musical Sadhana of a classical singer, Venkatasubbayya who lived during the reign of Madakarinayaka, the last Palegar of Chitradurga. For our purposes, his life is distinguished chiefly by two major episodes. The first is how by the dint of sheer hard work, devotion and penance, he makes the Carnatic Ragam Bhairavi reveal itself to him. Ever since, he is known as Bhairavi Venkatasubbayya. The second is his indomitable courage to refuse to sing before Tipu Sultan, the tyrant of Mysore as a mark of defiance and rebellion.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;#bhakti in #carnaticmusic, is it optional or mandatory? Are they intertwined? Many scholars have debated in the past, and in the present as well. Ofcourse, I surely do not want to answer to comments like &amp;lsquo;stick to your upanyasam&amp;rsquo; or &amp;lsquo;ignorance advertisements&amp;rsquo;. Any retorts will only sideline the topic of discussion to settle personal scores. I surely don&amp;rsquo;t want to do that. Let us focus on #carnaticmusic part alone.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;(1) Vedas have inbuilt swaras, but these swaras don&amp;rsquo;t touch all the octaves that music in the current form does. We have references in the commentaries to Vedas that the udatta, anudatta and swarita became the seven swaras over a period of time. Multiple references to music and instruments as such are laced in our itihasas and puranas.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I knew a shitty kid like this at school in the 70s (there were many shit kids, most turned out ok), he was violent with it. When he left school he joined the army. Fought for the country. The army channelled his aggression and gave him discipline.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I knew a couple kids who were psychologically unhinged, they were in the lowest stream at school. At my 1500 pupil London comprehensive school 20% of the kids were in the &amp;lsquo;C&amp;rsquo; stream (almost exclusively boys). This stream was for low achievers, the less intelligent kids. Some were bullies, trouble-makers, disruptive - others were passive and silent like Forest Gump. The teachers didn&amp;rsquo;t bother teaching them so they were given films to watch, and did low-level crap work for the school day.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;metacognition-in-animals&#34;&gt;Metacognition in animals&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Do animals and birds have meta-cognition? We can all agree that animals and birds are conscious, are capable of cognizing, but how can you evaluate your own mental states and repeat the acts that you think are causal in producing the mental state of pleasure in absence of metacognition? Playing for fun is not uncommon among animals or birds. But these also demonstrate mimicry, particularly copying human actions. If they are able to copy human actions and are able to evaluate their mental states, are they also able to evaluate the mental states of the humans that they are copying? And if so, they are also inter-subjectively aware. For me, these are not problems, because the way I understand consciousness is it can never be bereft of reflexivity and inter-subjectivity.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;What do you see? A man celebrating, right? That man, for those who don’t know, is New Zealand’s Craig McMillan. So, what’s McMillan celebrating? A century. That’s nice, right? A century that came off 67 balls. Gets better? Let me make it even better. A century off 67 balls against arch-rivals Australia in a chase of 347 when his team was down at 41/4 when he walked in. Sounds almost like some script of a movie, right?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

I understand that Atkinson was attempting to show the literal translation with hyphenated words, but this made for awkward reading (even without the hyphens, the translation is often tedious). I have also, in this electronic edition, eliminated footnotes referencing explicit page numbers in volumes 1 and 2.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;My father used to say, you value what you earn and not what you inherit. I realize its depth as days go by and as I witness the rise of despotism. If my generation fought for democracy, the new generation is fighting to reinstall dictatorship. And they say, it is for the better.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I remember being arrested one dark night alongside some hundred colleagues.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;I was fortunate to have been released after 18 hours of interrogation&lt;br&gt;&#xA;but not all my friends were lucky.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Someone had informed the police that the students had some pamphlets against the king.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Even though there was nothing to find,&lt;br&gt;&#xA;the investigation was severe.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Some of my friends were not that lucky.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Some were electrocuted while peeing.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Some were inserted pins through their nails.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;And others were jailed for six months or a year. For absolutely no reason - In suspicion that they could have been against the monarch.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Basu, my room mate, had the stamp of boot on his chest and he was bleeding through his ears.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;And they say, the king was peaceful.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Dhading Besi&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I wake up sometimes,&lt;br&gt;&#xA;With my feet pulsating with thrill,&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Of jumping through the fields of Thopal.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Some childhood memories stick by,&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Glued to our body, mingled with the soul.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Chasing after the kites,&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Rolling down the fields,&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Gliding along paper planes,&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Jumping in the cold waters of Thopal.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It feels as if the red dust from the slopes,&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Is still stuck to my body.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;And the nameless shadows,&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Faceless memories,&lt;br&gt;&#xA;I still hear the shrills of excited kids.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

I now propose to fill up that outline so comprehensively as to omit nothing essential, yet so concisely as to avoid being tedious; and, if the state of my health shall suffer me to continue long enough in this climate, it is my design, with your permission, to prepare for our annual meetings a series of short dissertations, unconnected in their titles and subjects, but all tending to a common point of no Small importance in the pursuit of interesting truths.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Arun had not even spent a few months sitting back in Dehradun when he had been posted to Joshimath district. He had recently joined the state medical services, and despite his parent&amp;rsquo;s remonstrations, he had wanted to serve in the state far flung, rural areas. The state health services had only just launched a small scheme, where doctors could serve for short periods in difficult to reach areas, adn then return to their private practices.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Let me tell you one! I feel safe telling these only on a Tuesday. Story has been received from a friend, who heard it from a medical officer in some military or Paramilitary battalion or refinement.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There was this Medical Officer, who was posted to glacier region. It was one of those snowy, dark, cold nights, and the Doctor Saab (as army and Paramilitary forces call their medical officers), was sitting in his tent. This Doctor saab was the son of some big shot bureaucrat, and arrogant to boot. Competent, compassionate towards patients, and all. But, arrogant, and with a hair trigger temper. That night, doctor Saab was angry. Really, truly angry. He had called up his commander who had slightly berated him. Mind you, this chap wasn&amp;rsquo;t used to listening to any crap from anyone. Listening to some khaalis 100% &amp;ldquo;daant&amp;rdquo; from someone, that too Some non medico! Huh!! Our doctor Saab was pissed, and his anger was about as high as the altitude where he was at. Why was he getting this daant? Well, the commander had wanted to know why doctor Saab was still at the post where he was.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;When my husband died, because he was so famous and known for not being a believer, many people would come up to me ― it still sometimes happens ― and ask me if Carl changed at the end and converted to a belief in an afterlife.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;They also frequently ask me if I think I will see him again. Carl faced his death with unflagging courage and never sought refuge in illusions. The tragedy was that we knew we would never see each other again. I don&amp;rsquo;t ever expect to be reunited with Carl.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I had the great misfortune of being a witness in an open and shut civil suit in a Delhi court. The case was filed in Apr 2019 and the judge had it entirely figured out in the first two hearings which were done by June. It&amp;rsquo;s been over 2 years since. I&amp;rsquo;ve lost count of the number of hearings now &amp;amp; there is absolutely zero progress. Luckily the complainant can afford to pay the lawyer just for marking attendance. This forced me to rethink my assumptions about the role of judiciary in India.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

I was going to college in Texas at the time and a group of us were contacted about a service project. The State needed a handful of young volunteers over the course of a Sunday afternoon and I was one of about ten that agreed to help.We were asked to go to the home of an elderly gentleman that had recently died and help sort his belongings. He didn’t have any close relatives and his estate was going up for auction. So, we were tasked with tearing everything out of his home and identifying items that had value to place inside “Auction” boxes, while the rest would be tossed in “Trash” boxes.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A story of Army Ethos&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The desert wind whipped around Naya Chor, a lonely outpost in the vast Sindh Desert. Inside the spartan office, Captain Aditya Singh, the Unit Adjutant, chuckled as the phone buzzed for the umpteenth time that day. He recognized the number – it could only be Jag Ram.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Jag Ram wasn&amp;rsquo;t your typical Subedar Major (SM Sahib). A former wrestler, his imposing size and booming voice were legendary within the battalion. Recruited from the famed &amp;ldquo;Pahlwan&amp;rdquo; (Wrestler) Coy of the Grenadiers, a unit known for its burly Jat soldiers, Jag Ram wasn&amp;rsquo;t just strong – he was a leader. He&amp;rsquo;d represented the Services in wrestling competitions, his dedication earning him the respect of his peers and superiors alike.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;all-knowing&#34;&gt;All-knowing&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Today I am having compassion for the being that is said to be all-knowing. and this compassion extends also to my philosopher colleagues who have extensively worked on omniscience. For every fact, there are millions of fabrications. One cannot actually know what love is like without experiencing it first hand. But what about hate? But I am more worried about knowing things like infinity. I do not think that all-knowing entity has not fathomed it, but then that would be finite. i am perfectly fine to remain ignorant than to know the hair count in every single rat ball, past and future.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

As for me, of course it reminds me of a Sanskrit story that makes the secrets of the British royal family look tame in comparison &amp;ndash; it has intrigue, affairs, and mistaken identities, but also some black magic, and a satisfying ending. Without further ado then, here is the story of Hamsavali from the Kathasaritsagara.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Let me tell you a story. One fine day, I was gossiping, strolling with one of the richest friends I ever had. Going to the opposite direction on the other side was a homeless couple, with their bags hanging on shoulder. My friend suddenly started laughing. When I asked what is the matter? she pointed to the other direction and said, &amp;lsquo;how cute, a hobo couple.&amp;rsquo;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Very few among you know that I was on the street at one point in my life. I realized that day that no matter how much you read or how much you meditate, as long as you are not out for real seva, real service, you are not cultivating your heart. Right at that moment, I decided that if I ever were to have my own school, I will make service a primary element.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Even historically, Varna was not always discernible for there is no empirical laboratory test to determine the same. When the British started categorising Hindu communities into castes, they frequently ran into people who knew their jaati but didn&amp;rsquo;t even know what to make of the term &amp;lsquo;Varna&amp;rsquo;. That does not mean that Varna is expendable but quite simply that it does not lend itself to reductionist hot takes by politicians. Varna can therefore be treated as a theoretical idea for the purpose of analysis.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;[Replug from April 2018] &lt;em&gt;Adi Shankaracharya&lt;/em&gt;&#xA;The Wikipedia entry for Adi Shankara introduces him as &amp;ldquo;an early 8th century Indian philosopher and theologian who consolidated the doctrine of Advaita Vedanta&amp;rdquo;. It is reflective of the modern understanding of his life and achievements. Therefore, it is patently untrue.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The 8th century claim has, of course, been contested by the very mathas he established but there are even more significant things that would be called &amp;lsquo;problematic&amp;rsquo;. Adi Shankara was not a mere philosopher, though debating was his favourite method of teaching and he was certainly not a theologian, for he was not speculating on the nature of God. Advaita proclaims the unity of Atman and Nirguna Brahman, which has no attributes. How can we hope to describe that which has no attributes? As Shankara himself writes,&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;That Kashmir earned for itself the title, &amp;lsquo;Rishi-waer&amp;rsquo; or the garden of Rishis, is not a matter of chance or romantic speculation. If you were born in Kashmir as a Hindu, you would have to be exceedingly obtuse to miss this glaring everyday fact of life. The valley was indeed a powerhouse that seemed to attract high-voltage specimens of our species. They were called &amp;ldquo;maet&amp;rdquo; in plural, crazy literally or &amp;ldquo;mastanas&amp;rdquo;. They were too ecstatic to be coherent, too blissful to be sane, too evolved to be civilized.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Two things happened today. First, I read about the statements on Kashmir made by a couple of Kashmiri Pandit ladies, Nitasha Kaul and Aarti Tikoo Singh (incidentally a darling of the Raitawing), at the US House Foreign Affairs Committee hearing. I quote from the written statement submitted by the latter: &amp;ldquo;What the foot-soldiers of the Pakistani military and ISI (Inter-Services Intelligence) have done to ordinary Kashmiri Muslims in the last 30 years, pales in comparison to the human rights violations committed by the Indian state.”+++(5)+++&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Cotton Balls&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We all assume that teachers teach. This is self-given. But we all who teach know very well that we anticipate a clean whiteboard to start the class. I get so annoyed when some math teachers are too tired to clean the board. Teaching is a tender balance between spelling new scripts and erasing the old ones. Actually memory and forgetting are like two sides of the same coin of being. Sometimes we crave for some memories but other times we wish to forget. The actual class time is filled with writings but the board is empty before and after.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;When I say I was 12 when I left home in search for knowledge,&lt;br&gt;&#xA;people admire me and look at me with disbelief.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;I didn’t run away. My father walked with me for an entire hour till the dawn.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;My father didn’t have this luxury.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;He left home to go to Gurukula at the age of six. All by himself.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Unfortunately my grandfather passed away when my father was ten&lt;br&gt;&#xA;and he had to return home and give the final rites.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Since he was the oldest child,&lt;br&gt;&#xA;he was responsible for the entire family&lt;br&gt;&#xA;and so he could not go back to his school.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The ‘management lessons from Mahabharata’ fraud&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Why look at such a rich tradition of literature to extract banal lessons on how to squeeze a little extra from your corporate job? Let us read stories for what they are and they will enchant us anew.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;With all the news on the political front the same old, same old, perhaps you will allow me to indulge in a little tirade on one of my pet peeves &amp;ndash; courses on management techniques from the Bhagavad Gita. Or its more sophisticated counterpart, courses on applying Indian knowledge systems to contemporary law, engineering, and what-not. I was once at a discussion session with one of the greatest living experts on a particular Sanskrit philosophical discipline, and he was asked, “How do you think what we learn here can elevate the contemporary legal system?” And he replied simply, “It cannot”.+++(5 ??)+++&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Allowing the government to take care of us is always about the tacit consent to removing our skin from the game, superficially akin to outsourcing the disagreeable or difficult tasks to experts but closer to giving up personal and communal responsibility. There is a line to be drawn somewhere but apparently we ran out of ink long back. It is a vicious circle that we descended into at the time of independence, or maybe even before that.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The Epic of Gilgamesh is only major Mesopotamian literary text whose author is named. Reading the text, it’s easy to see why. Whoever he may have been, Sîn-Lēqi-Unnunni possessed the key quality that unites great writers throughout the ages - he understood people. Good writing must rest on particular human truths. In Gilgamesh, we see many such truths beautifully rendered. In this thread, I hope to examine just one of them: the transcendent power of male friendship.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In a recent conversation with a friend on the rising threat associated with speaking your mind in a typical American workplace, I remarked that the abandonment of the sacred realm in modern society has made people emotionally fragile and socially handicapped. In healthy traditional societies, the sacred belongs to the Gods. In societies that are falling apart, the idea of a jealous grandfather in the sky and his sidekick occupies that space but still manages to keep insanity at bay. But what happens to a society that degenerates further and takes the journey from Gods to the one true God to its logical conclusion, i.e doing away with the sacred entirely? In other words, how has modern society coped with the loss of the sacred realm, other than by diligently working to destroy the planet?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Ready?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So this is a story that happens in a 3 BHK house in Mumbai, around the 80s. The family consisted of a father, mother, two sisters, and their grandmother (mother’s mother). Granny was very old and virtually bed ridden. The daughters were between 14 and 17 years old. Granny spent the entire day in her room lying on the bed and chanting some mantra that no one could really make out. The younger daughter used to bring lunch and dinner for granny everyday and sat chatting with her till she finished. Sometimes the elder daughter did this.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

It has not helped you, and it is not going to help anybody else&amp;rdquo;, said U.G. when I approached him with the idea of publishing excerpts from his conversations with the constant stream of people who go to visit him. Despite his view on the matter, I went ahead and published the first book some years ago. U.G. called it the &amp;ldquo;Mistake of Enlightenment&amp;rdquo;. Mistake or no mistake, the book, &amp;ldquo;The Mystique of Enlightenment&amp;rdquo; was a sell-out. It was subsequently translated and published in almost all European languages. The Chinese and Russian translations are awaiting publication. A demand for reprints of the book gave me impetus to publish instead this companion volume &amp;ldquo;Mind is a Myth&amp;rdquo;, Disquieting Conversations with the Man called U.G. This book is a little similar to, and a lot different from &amp;ldquo;The Mystique of Enlightenment&amp;rdquo;. DINESH VAGHELA: PUBLISHER&lt;/p&gt;</description>

At the same time, I point out that there is no such thing as enlightenment at all. I say that because all my life I&amp;rsquo;ve searched and wanted to be an enlightened man, and I discovered that there is no such thing as enlightenment at all, and so the question whether a particular person is enlightened or not doesn&amp;rsquo;t arise. I don&amp;rsquo;t give a hoot for a sixth-century-BC Buddha, let alone all the other claimants we have in our midst. They are a bunch of exploiters, thriving on the gullibility of the people. There is no power outside of man. Man has created God out of fear. So the problem is fear and not God.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;New Doll&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Translated from the original Bengali by Bhaswati Ghosh&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;changing-tastes&#34;&gt;Changing tastes&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There was a master craftsman who made dolls as playthings for little girls of the royal family. Every year, a doll fair was held in the palace courtyard. All other artisans accorded the master the highest honour at the fair.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When he was nearly eighty years old, there came a new craftsman. Youthful in age and fresh in his style, he was called Kishanlal. Of the dolls he made, some he would finish, others he would leave incomplete. Some he would colour, others he wouldn’t. It appeared the dolls hadn’t been finished yet and never would be.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Yet they are as refreshing and fragrant as a fresh breeze, but they can also be as devastating as a wild fire! They are as nourishing as the earth and water, if only we can just listen to them and then &amp;ldquo;forget all about them!&amp;rdquo; U.G.&amp;rsquo;s teachings can certainly bring us down to the earth from the lofty but cloudy skies of illusion, so that we can come back and live a &amp;ldquo;simple and ordinary life&amp;rdquo; of peace without struggle or conflict!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

The first guru was Bhairavi Brahmani.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Sri Ramakrishna, by his own desire to realize the various forms of God, practised the well-known ways of reaching out to the realization of God. But because of the physical and mental symptoms that he developed everyone around him thought that he had gone mad. And therefore there was great anguish in the hearts of those who knew him and loved him, to cure him. They were trying to find out remedies to get him out of his “God madness”. This phenomenon also was not unknown in India. &amp;hellip; Bhairavi Brahmani tried to convince him that he was not suffering from any disease. But because others would not believe this, he would cry and keep running to the Mother and ask her why she was putting him through this.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;revenge-of-a-logician&#34;&gt;Revenge of a Logician&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Two friends grew up together in their gurukula, school. One studied astrology, another logic. They both became quite established in their fields. The logician (Naiyāyika) wrote a good number of commentaries and introduced some new categories. The astrologer made tons of money. Tired of his poverty, the logician embarked to see his successful friend and ask for his help.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It is hard to imagine how quickly people change when they become successful. The astrologer could not stop making fun of the poor logician for the choice of his subject. And the villagers laughed at his cost. Heart-broken, the logician said farewell. When his friend tried to give him some money, he asked for just one single hair. The astrologer happily pulled one hair and gave it as a gift.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Source: &lt;a href=&#34;https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1582615110958612481.html&#34;&gt;TW&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When Gods Wake Up – What the movie ‘#Kantara’ means for Hindus. Raw! Visceral! Existential! Unprecedented! And flagrantly Hindu! That is what Kantara is, and oh how! It is a celebration of ‘Being Hindu’. It is a movie made by the Deva himself. This is how.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Kantara completely inverts the way the colonized Hindus have been interpreting their own world, culture and civilization to the world in the past 200 years and inverts it to bring it back to its original position – fearless, unconscious recognition of the Divine all around us! It is not a story told by humans about the Devas. It is a story which the Deva tells to humans, from a divine point of view. Since our contact with the West, Hindus have been trying to ‘interpret’ their dharma, rituals, customs &amp;amp; tradition in the language of the colonizers. We have become accustomed to say, ‘it is a Hindu ‘belief’…’, ‘according to Hindu beliefs…’ almost completely convinced ourselves that our stories are just fairy tales imagined by illiterate, superstitious and ignorant ancestors, which need ‘scientific interpretation’. Slowly, we became so used to this constant cultural translation in our minds that we ourselves started believing that our stories are just stories with no existence on any plane of consciousness. We became ‘rational’ and bought into the Judeo-Christian/ Enlightenment paradigm.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>pashubali learnings</title>

      <guid>https://vishvAsa.github.io/english/prose/hindu/AshIsh-dhAr/pashubali-learnings/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Learnings from the reactions to pashubali from the krantikaris of modern India:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;There is little to differentiate a rootless liberal from a political Hindu when it comes to their views on Dharma.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Modern Hindus lack a basic understanding of fundamental aspects/concepts of Dharma like sampradAya, adhikAra, shAstra, pramAna etc.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Respect for figures of authority like the revered AchAryas is completely missing and so is an awareness, much less the appreciation, of the rich dialectical tradition they have unfortunately inherited.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;People actually think that rituals and texts CAN and MUST be amended to suit their personal whims.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Most don&amp;rsquo;t seem to comprehend the difference between devas (deities) and brahman (supreme reality). No, most don&amp;rsquo;t even know that there is something called brahman, which is different from brAhman. There is only that God fellow.+++(5)+++&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Not surprisingly, most Hindus have imbibed a deeply Protestant sense of religiosity. Reality is simply what they believe in, complexity and nuance be damned.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;They have no independent value system and everything is evaluated in reference to others. Like bali is bad because &amp;rsquo;they&amp;rsquo; also slaughter animals.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;There is a profound absence of skin-in-the-game. Imposition of alien moral standards does not evoke an intuitive revolt from most people.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The creme de la creme among these guys consists of AryasamAjis who believe that whatever seems cursorily unpleasant in smritis is the work of Max Muller and other colonial scholars. For example, they have a sanitized version of Manusmriti called Vishuddha Manusmriti.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The phenomenon is not restricted to the urban and English speaking types but pervades the entirety of our blessed geography, especially north of the Vindhyas.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;They have zero personal experience of upasana  and sadhana so it is dismissed out of hand. (As Rohit Arya rightly commented below)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;They have totally internalized the colonial discourse on Hindu practices. When they run out of things to say, they blurt out random words like Sati, narbali etc without pausing to think how it is relevant to the discussion. (Point courtesy Neha Srivastava)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Any sacred sthal is equivalent to a picnic spot and should hence be transformed into such for the ease of the tourist, the environment and deity can go to hell for all they care. (Point courtesy Rupam Das)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I will add more points as and when I come across fresh gobar on Social Media.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;ecological-concern&#34;&gt;Ecological concern&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;ecological concern is not just an environmental concern; it also is not our concern for other species. at the end of the day, it is the search for our own lost soul. we are the only species capable of making a difference and saving species. nature has given us that power. it is about how we embrace our responsibility.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;kalis-magic&#34;&gt;Kali&amp;rsquo;s Magic&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I could not resist the temptation to climb up the little mound right next to the town. After the sunset, mountains wake up with their own music of silence and the blanket of darkness only makes them luminous nothing. It was just a hike of ten minutes and I wanted to capture this moment while my brother was still a company.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;shorts&#34;&gt;Shorts&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Long ago in Nepal, people elected their leader by a marathon. Inspired by this, I believe we can have a similar system. Rather than a race, we should let the best comedian win.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;in-defense-of-her-majesty&#34;&gt;In Defense of Her Majesty&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It is ridiculous for me to reconsider monarchy after four decades, as the first time I marched in the streets of Kathmandu against monarchy, I was just a teenager. But then, I had not watched The Truman Show; it was not even made. Hollywood did exist, but I had not read Baudrillard.   I did attend some carnivals but nobody even mentioned Bakhtin. My support is not for power but for grandiose, for extravagance and for the simulacra. With the royals around, we all can appreciate the Lorde within each of us.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;About a hundred years ago, a distant relative of Rāḻḻapalli Ananthakrishna Sarma had once gone on a pilgrimage to Kāśī and other places. When he was in Mathura or in some other place, he had completely spent all his money. It was not easy in those times to procure money by writing a letter back home.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;With no other option, he went to one of the pawn-broker shops and requested the lender, “I need some money now. I will be able to repay your money once I return home. I don’t have any item to pledge in your favour. However, I have visited Kāśī, Prayāga, and other holy places. You may accept the puṇya [loosely, ‘merit gathered by good deeds’] that I have gained by visiting those holy places as the pledge and loan me some money.”&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>rat &amp; camel</title>

      <guid>https://vishvAsa.github.io/english/prose/mongol/rat_camel/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Once upon a time, the Mongols were giving the names of the animals to the twelve years of the calendar. They had allotted the names of eleven animals, and were won- dering what name to give to the very first year, when the camel and the rat began to quarrel as to whose name should be included. In order that neither of them should feel affronted, the Tathāgata appeared and told them to decide for themselves. The two animals made a wager that whichever of them should be the first to see the rays of the rising sun the next day should be put at the top of the twelve years. The camel stood waiting for the sun to rise, looking towards the east where it rises. The rat climbed on to the camel&amp;rsquo;s hump and looked westwards the whole time, gazing at the top of the mountain. Then, when the time came for the sun to rise and the sun&amp;rsquo;s first rays touched the top of the mountain in the west, the rat was the first to see the sunlight, and shouted out: &amp;lsquo;The sun has risen. The camel was cross at losing the wager, and rushed to trample the rat to death, but the rat ran under a heap of ashes and saved its life. From that time onwards, whenever it sees a place where ashes have been thrown out, the camel tramples and rolls on the ashes, trying to squash the rat his enemy. So the rat got included in the twelve years, and the camel was excluded. Although the camel did not get included in the twelve years, he is said to carry the features of all the twelve animals in his body. These features are:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A hundred thousand years ago, we were just noisy apes halfway up the forest food chain. Then something happened. We gave up the insistence on close blood ties to form the bonds of trust. We learnt the art of large-scale collaboration. Sapiens began to dominate the planet and raced to the top of the pyramid.&#xA;This rush to the top, attributable entirely to a large number of homosapiens working towards common objectives was made possible by the art of storytelling. For a species that is naturally lacking in mutual trust, the unforeseen camaraderie among total strangers to achieve collective objectives was brought in through the backdoor, by the invention of abstract concepts and fictional descriptions of the world. This belief in fiction to organize people into teams is what truly sets us apart from our less evolved cousins. Everything that we do is driven by fiction. From loyalty to the country to working in a corporation, all collective human activity is driven by imagined stories of progress and greatness as opposed to concrete perceivable realities.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

During that period, I wrote some articles for the Indian newsgroups on my experiences after returning to India. Since that time, I have been pleasantly surprised at the number of persons who claim to have read them. They are reproduced here.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

My wife delivered a healthy girl over 4 kg. However, the paediatrician over there just told us that my child is suffering from acute pneumonia and she needs to be operated immediately (There was no symptoms and my sister countered him but she cannot to do anything as he was the paediatrician). Before I could do anything, he called an ambulance from a five-star “hotel” and before we could say anything my daughter was literally abducted. My sister and me followed the ambulance to the hotel.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The Sage and the Housewife&lt;br&gt;&#xA;By &lt;em&gt;Shanta Kelker&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Stories of U.G. in Bangalore&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;0&#34;&gt;0&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This book on U.G.Krishnamurti brings a whiff of fresh air in an atmosphere infested with self-proclaimed godmen, gurus and pseudo-religious seekers. If you like to tread a path of adventure risking your pet beliefs, assumed certainties and habitual hypocrisies, you will love this unique work by a simple and ordinary housewife. Her spontaneous encounters with the enigmatic sage are full of wit and humor. The amusing episodes transport you to newer heights of crystal clear vision of yourself. U.G.&amp;rsquo;s straightforward but ego-shattering statements give you no scope to duck out of real life situations leaving you to face life as it comes.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Long ago, during when Goa was undergoing strife a Saraswat Brahmin family migrated to coastal Karnataka and moved to an interior place. They brought with them an amsha of their kuladevi. They were given land by the Jain landlord of that area for the Brahmin was able to cure an ailment in the landlord&amp;rsquo;s family with the gandha and tIrtha offered to the Kuladevi.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

In particular, I wish to examine the issue of the apparent similarities (or symmetry) between statements made by scientists and those made by mystics concerning the unity of existence (or of the universe). I shall argue that the positions of the scientists and those of the mystics are not comparable, and I wish to propose that the very premise that the mystic or the scientist has any sort of experience or knowledge of a state of unity, especially when seen in the light of the teachings of U.G. Krishnamurti, a contemporary teacher, is questionable.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

First of all, both the words are not properly translated in this English rendering. But you got the idea.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;My Guruji Khaptad Baba used to say, there are two types of seekers: the pig types and the swan types. The pig types only search for the dirt and the swan types only search for the good. And of course the average world is the same no matter where you go and no matter who you talk with.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Non-duality of Sevā&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;problem&#34;&gt;Problem&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It makes sense that we do not call sevā when we are serving ourselves, when we are fulfilling our own needs or when there is nobody but ourselves benefitting from it. But this raises a question, can we perform sevā recognizing non-duality? How can a liberated person who does not recognize the other as the other still serve the other?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;duality-within-non-duality&#34;&gt;Duality within non-duality&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The premise that sevā rests on duality is a huge misconception. First, it assumes that someone liberated and who has recognized oneness among all does not see the other as the other and therefore cannot serve the other. This is like saying, a billionaire cannot have in change. This is not the singularity that erases plurality. But rather, this singularity subsumes all the singularities. If a forest were to cognize itself as a forest, it still would know its individuality of being particular trees. When I recognize my body as my body, I still recognize my fingers as my fingers.+++(5)+++&lt;/p&gt;</description>

I keep repeating that Shakti puja, durga upasana etc is the key to dharmic revival. Well, maximum Durga pujas happen in Bengal and we can see where the state has landed with 30% ROP followers, matter of few decades when they will take over, and the Hindus specially Kolkata aantel types are all secular dhimmified suicidal maniacs who are beyond reason and arguments. For example when idols are broken in B&amp;rsquo;desh you find people protesting even in the USA, but Bengali Hs of Kolkata are clueless, like ostrict with head inside sand, singing secular mantras to carry on their self inflicted brainwashing. So why this condition, inspite of so many durga pujas?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;I think I am the most appropriate women to answer this as I am a Sikh women married to a Muslim man for last 28 yrs in the state of Madhya Pradesh. We got married in year 1990. For understandable reasons you can excuse me for not coming up with my real name as being a mother of one daughter and son at this age I would like to keep my identity intact. But I have to tell my story and I think this is the most appropriate forum to make my views public.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We are two sisters only and younger one is married to a Hindu man, it all started from me as I did my thing of marrying my ‘love’ hence it became difficult for parents to say no to my younger sister for another inter-faith marriage as she too went ahead with marrying her love.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

She called me from New York and asked me if I could write a note on how these tapes came about. I gratefully answered.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When U.G. invited me in July 1978 to come to Bangalore, where he stayed in his friends&amp;rsquo; house and from where he arranged his Indian travels in those times, my immediate answer was, &amp;ldquo;Yes Sir, I would like to.&amp;rdquo; At the same time I reminded him of my invitation to him a year before to come to Amsterdam: &amp;ldquo;Many people there are waiting to see you, Sir.&amp;rdquo; After five years, U.G. finally came to Amsterdam in 1982, and stayed, much to his own surprise, for 21 days in a beautiful house offered by some former Rajnishis. My own house at that time was neither big enough nor suitable otherwise, as, for one thing, Valentine (&amp;ldquo;my traveling companion,&amp;rdquo; &amp;ndash; as U.G. calls her), was still accompanying U.G. in all his travels.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The Sunrise&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Remember the days when we would run out to the new sun every morning and sing with birds and run with the wind? I am not talking about you but about those who were born before the machine age. In those days kids were allowed to have a life and our growth was not measured on the equations we could solve. When I walked out to the sun this morning, I reminisced the first touch of sunlight in the morning and I could not stop indulging myself of being in the nature even though I myself have sold my soul to the machine life. For since the day I came, it had been raining and it was lovely to see the Stony Brook with its full luster.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

This is a deeply painful personal thread. My personal life, in contrast to my business life, has been a long tragedy. Autism destroyed our lives and left me suicidally depressed.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;My wife Pramila and I were in this fight against autism for over 15 years. She is a super mom and her passionate cause is curing our son of autism. I worked hard along with her. To ensure his safety, I also took some of his treatments so I could know what they did to him.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Europe is going through the worst heat wave in years. U.G. receives me at the airport with Sushma (the French ex-Rajneeshi who was once a pharmacist). We drive to the hotel which is situated in a seedy area. Our hotel is sandwiched between two sex shops. We have lunch in a vegetarian restaurant. Food there is sold by weight. Late in the evening, Mario arrives with &amp;ldquo;Gorgeous&amp;rdquo; (Lisa). Mario and Lisa, too, were Rajneeshis not very long ago. &amp;ldquo;I could not sell the images of the goddess Lakshmi, nor could I sell the Buddhas at the fair in Munich,&amp;rdquo; says Mario on arrival. U.G. laughs.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;shorts&#34;&gt;Shorts&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When there were teachers, I was not ready to listen.  When I opened my ears, they were gone.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;teachers-never-die&#34;&gt;Teachers Never Die&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Teachers Never Die. I used this exact copy of Bhuṣaṇasāra 35 years ago, when I studied with Bidur Paudyal. My friends evolved and did great many things in their lives. I, on the other hand, am stuck with the same old book, reminiscing the old times. Students are transitory. Teachers are transitory. All these relations are preconditions for the power beyond our being to express itself.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;My tears are not so cheap&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There is no counting of the times I have cried - Sometimes even not knowing why.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;I remember crying, actually following my sister,&lt;br&gt;&#xA;when the doctor gave up on my mother.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;My father asked why was I crying and since I did not know,&lt;br&gt;&#xA;I looked at my sister.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Mother survived but I never forgot the scene.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I remember some drops falling when I was with my friends offering flowers to BP Koirala.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;I was not educated enough to understand why this person was important.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;May be I cried because that was the first time I had come across a dead body.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Is there any room left for the skeptics like myself in this world?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;liking&#34;&gt;Liking&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Facebook is making our concept of liking very shallow. When I clicked like for one page it said I already liked it. There is no room for me to like the same thing again and again. Well this says all about the Facebook likes.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;U.G.: NEITHER KNOWLEDGE NOR WISDOM&#xA;THERE IS NOBODY THERE&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;By&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Jean-Michel Terdjman&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;What U.G. is telling us is not contradictory, incoherent or illogical. It may seem so because we don&amp;rsquo;t know how to take it. We don&amp;rsquo;t know how to take it because what has been called his &amp;ldquo;teaching&amp;rdquo; is no teaching at all. U.G. is always enunciating mere statements of fact, in their rawest possible form. He does not provide us with the context, the perspective necessary to see how they fit. The reason this is so is not that he is trying to wake us up from our stupor (in my opinion, he has no agenda whatsoever), but simply that he has no reason of his own to do so. What he says is absolutely true, yet, at the same time, is an expression of history (he says it in English and not in Chinese, and he speaks English with a foreign accent) and of his personality (he is lazy, and full of energy and aggressive inclinations, very gentle with the heart of a butcher, and an anti-Semite to boot &amp;ndash; not out of conviction, of course: just to remind his Jewish friends how illusory their self-identification is). In other words, U.G. is not a creature from outer space: his actions and his utterances, like ours, are expressions of total conditioning. Like us, he is an event in nature.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

But if you think it will help you or anyone else in any way on their spiritual path, you are miserably mistaken. I have no illusions about it at all,&amp;rdquo; said U.G. Apart from my mundane motives, which are the only &amp;lsquo;real&amp;rsquo; motives, according to U.G., I felt that this man should be known widely for whatever he is. In spite of his vehement assertion that he has no message for mankind, I still feel that what he says is like a &amp;lsquo;statutory warning&amp;rsquo; printed on a pack of cigarettes. It &amp;rsquo;s up to you to heed to it. If you do not like what he says it may be because he does not tell you what you want to hear.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;shorts&#34;&gt;Shorts&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Every society or civilization is founded on myth. It is not the power of  truth but of myth that keeps the culture alive. The first liberation is to free oneself from these constructions.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;freedom&#34;&gt;Freedom&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It is the inner drive, a surge of being that overpowers the conditions of us being in whichever states. This is not a judgment upon something, this is not a philosophy or politics. We do not explore freedom, it is the other way around. It is the freedom that has found us and freedom will keep finding all the new forms.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;My father-in-law had often mentioned that his father (Baba ji) had prevented him from going to the US for further studies. Born in a village in western UP named Fazalpur (later changed to Sundar Nagar) in pre-Independence India, he worked hard and eventually graduated from IIT Roorkee and became the first engineer from the village. When he secured acceptance in a university in the US, his excitement turned to dust because Baba ji would not hear of him leaving the village to never return just like another person who had left the village some years ago to study in the US. Babaji tore up the acceptance letter and asked my father-in-law to focus on making a career in India.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Too many people suddenly feeling nostalgic about Bajrang Dal and VHP. They are lamenting that they are no longer a patch on what they used to be. Well, they were cut down to size by the bigshots as soon as they started smelling power in the 90s. The thing is the bigshots were uncomfortable with their existence because the so-called goons were no longer politically useful to them and only embarrassed them in the media, 5-star conferences, and lit fests. So, the big names started distancing themselves from these outfits. But the real blow came after their 2004 defeat in national elections. The state leadership of Gujarat, led by leader ji, started reopening all the closed cases against VHP and Bajrang Dal. The govt got so vicious that they forced a firebrand VHP leader, Prahlad Shastri, to commit suicide in 2005.+++(5)+++&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;poetic-vision&#34;&gt;Poetic vision&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We are woven twice, in two different layers of our being. The first is when the being or sat expressed itself, it being manifest as mantras. We then were the songs articulated by the first poet, Brahmā. But his poetry lacked shades and needed more colors to be infused. His grandson Shukra made it possible, weaving the threads, the chandas, once again. His love for Divyā, a demon princess with a divine name, explains the paradox behind this poetic vision. Sapped with his vigor and lust, poetry came to life, with the lineage of both gods and demons. We can still distill the mantras of the grandfather in the songs of Shukra.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I am in mood today to share you some stories that I have never shared with anybody. It was around 1989. I was back to Kathmandu that time and my guruji [Prem Chetan] insisted that I perform the ritual of life-installation for one temple. I was actually commissioned by Aishwarya Shaha, the Queen of Nepal. And for the days long life-installation prāṇa-pratiṣṭhā ritual ( Krishna temple in Bhimsengola, Purano Baneshwar), the queen gave me six rupees [about a dime] for dakṣiṇā. I do not know how many of you have felt vanity this close.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
