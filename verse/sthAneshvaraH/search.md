Search  

Woke up with an urge to look for it,  
And searched everywhere,  
Inside and out,  
Upstairs and downstairs,  
And realized,  
I had long forgotten what it was about.+++(5)+++  

And they said they knew,  
But I was not certain,  
And some came and said it was nothing,  
But I knew it was not nothing,  
This veil through which,  
I only see some shadows,  
And know it is not nothing.+++(5)+++  

And some came,  
To help me search,  
All like me,  
Who have also forgotten,  
What the quest is all about.
