Lost  

So close, so intimate,  
Yet so forgotten is life.  
Like the autumn leaves,  
Waving with the final shower of beauty,  
Before splitting from the mother tree.  

A moment of nostalgia,  
A moment of anguish,  
Recalling sweet and sour footprints,  
This is all I got,  
In my lost time, walking through the sunset cliffs.  

Some friends faded in memory,+++(4)+++  
Others, swept in the tides of time.  
Some chose to forget me,+++(5)+++  
And others I let go from the screen.  

The moment that was lived,  
The moment that we laughed together,  
That moment will be there,  
Even when I am lost,  
In the far shore of being.
