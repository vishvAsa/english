Nirvana  

Sky covered with musky dust,  
Slowly enveloping dusk,  
Birds sheltered in the bamboo bush,  
Singing the final songs of the day,  
I gazed all the horizons,  
In quest for the shadow,  
That stole some strings of my heart.  

My gaze in the empty sky,  
Echoes the lost melancholies,  
And Kama suspends his amorous play,  
In the roars of the clouds,  
Or the dazzles of the thunder,  
As I search thy name and form,  

Let me dissolve in thee,  
For my being is not big,  
To encompass thy presence,+++(5)+++  
And all the pulsations of thy heart,  
Will find a piece of me.
