Wind Chimes

Last few days have been windy,  
And the chimes are singing,  
Stirring emotions from beneath surface,  
Seeking any form to erupt out.  

They chime melancholiness,  
With a surge of momentariness,  
Pushing me sometimes in between,  
My waking and dreaming states.  

Directionless wind, seeking its voice,  
Assembles in my mind,  
And the wavering sounds,  
Probe my heart for pangs,  
Where echos form the empty ground.
