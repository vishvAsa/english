title = "Great again"  
+++  

I feel immobile,  
And empty of words,  
Witnessing the ways blood is spilled,  
In the streets to make dystopia great again.  

Going back to Shastras,  
Wanting to make sense of the events,  
Make me thoughtless,  
As there is nothing on earth,  
To make Buchenwald+++(=A nAzi camp)+++ great again.+++(5)+++  

This has been like watching,  
The Mount Everest collapse,  
And all the mountains, to make a gopher hill tall again.  
I marched in the streets when sixteen,  
And now watch with disbelief,  
The models were hollow from within,+++(5)+++  
Eaten by the termites of race,  
Wanting to make Mussolini great again.
