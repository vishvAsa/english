Recall  
I know I lost something,  
I quite forget what it is,  
The urge inside like tidal waves,  
Shake me numb, begging to recall.  

Shuffling faces and scrolling down pages,  
Names and forms appear and vanish,  
I urge myself to remember,  
It is like dense darkness,  
Or a thick fog covering all-around,  
Like a cataract of the mind,  
The one that Vasubandhu had,  
But now may be I recall,  
These must be the words,  
I must have lost my words.
