## Emptiness
There is a gap  
Between my emptiness and that of the Buddha  
And all that exists,  
Lies in between.

## Palm tree and the sun
The palm tree greeted farewell to the setting sun,  
Standing on the hilltop,  
Just like it welcomed the rising sun.

The palm tree did not greet farewell to the sun,  
Neither did the sun come and go.
