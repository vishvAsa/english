Kali  

Mother - the world is fearsome,  
Let me stay in your belly,  
I beg you chew me with your sharp teeth,  
And dissolve me within you.+++(5)+++  

Oh Karankini, do not let me escape your grips,  
Ghosts and goblins in the cremation ground,  
Are one thousand times better than maya.+++(4)+++  

Oh Krodhana, have mercy on me,  
Let the fire of your rage burn me alive,  
And dissolve me in your purity.+++(4)+++  

Bhairavi, break down the shackles of difference,  
And you Lelihana, swallow my very being,+++(4)+++  

For when I am in you,  
I am you and you are me.  
When you make me something,  
I am me and you are you.+++(4)+++  

Let Khecari be in charge,  
And let me be nothing again.+++(4)+++
