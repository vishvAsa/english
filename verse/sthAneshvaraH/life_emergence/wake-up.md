title = "Wake up"  
+++  

Buddha wants me to wake up,  
To the reality of emptiness and the emptiness of reality.  
Shamkara screams to break my slumber,  
To give me the realization,  
Of my singularity.  

It is just that my mother,  
The dark and crazy one,  
Keeps telling me,  
Sleep my child, there is nothing for you to worry.+++(5)+++
