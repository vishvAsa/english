edited life  

looking for a beginning,  
or some resolution,  
to make sense of fleeting moments,+++(5)+++  
pieced together,  
some fern and mango leaves together,  
some thrones and blossoms together,  
edited some agonies,  
cut out some nightmares,  
to make life-narrative worth sharing.  

do not ask me,  
why the pieces do not match,  
and are like broken shells,  
crushed by the wheels of time.+++(4)+++  

i will sing with you,  
when find some songs worth sharing,  
and a rhythm, a melody.  

as promised,  
we will meet on the hilltop,  
at the sunset,  
before birds return to their nests.
