title = "A word"

Where can I find a word,  
that you and I can share,  
not a simulation from the ghosts,  
but a word that resonates the heart,  
and ignites the same passion,  
that you and i rediscover each other,  
in the agonies and pangs of each other,  
that you can hear without your ears,  
not because my words are significant,  
but because they mean something to me.
