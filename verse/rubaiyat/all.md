In Heaven's blue bowl the wine of morning brims,  
A little cloud, a rose-leaf, in it swims,  
The thirsty earth drinks morning from a bowl  
Whose sides are space and crusted stars its rims.

<details open><summary>LeGallienne</summary>

Yea! 'tis the morn! and like a morning star  
The Sultan's palace glitters from afar,  
No false mirage of morning, phantom-fair,  
But blue-eyed day throned on his diamond car.

Awake! my soul, and haste betimes to drink,

Poor homeless men that have no other home,  
Unto the wine-shop early are we come,  
Since darkling dawn have we been waiting here,  
Waiting and waiting for the day to come.

<details open><summary>Verse</summary>

<details open><summary>LeGallienne</summary>

For some have love, some gold, and some have fame,

Nothing but wine—yet happy all the same.

<details open><summary>LeGallienne</summary>

Youth, like a magic bird, has flown away,  
He sang a little morning-hour in May,

O have you deemed, who looked on us with scorn,  
Poor drunkards, dreaming-drunk from morn to morn,  
Our raiment stained, our reputation gone,  
That all our heart is grape or barley-corn?

<details open><summary>LeGallienne</summary>

Within the haunted wine-cup more than wine  
It is that makes a mortal man divine,  
We seek a drink more deadly and more strange  
Than ever grew on any earthly vine.  
</details>
</details>

<details open><summary>Verse</summary>

<details open><summary>LeGallienne</summary>

The wine-cup is the little silver well  
Where Truth, if Truth there be, doth ever dwell;  
Death too is there,—and Death who would not seek?—  
And Love that in itself is Heaven and Hell.  
</details>
</details>

<details open><summary>Verse</summary>

<details open><summary>LeGallienne</summary>

The wine-cup is a wistful magic glass,

Dead lips press ours upon its scented brim,  
Old voices whisper many a sweet 'alas!'

<details open><summary>LeGallienne</summary>

Whether you would abide or go away,  
Wine will befriend you, friend; for, if you stay,

<details open><summary>Verse</summary>

<details open><summary>LeGallienne</summary>

Some that would leave this world take dreadful means:  
One wrenching poisons, one steel, another leans  
His brow on sudden fire; but wine is best—  
Poets have died so, and many kings and queens.  
</details>

<details open><summary>Verse</summary>

<details open><summary>LeGallienne</summary>

Wine is the tender friend of suicides,  
You drown so softly in its gentle tides;  
You know not you are dying, yet you die;  
And love with rose-leaves all the ruin hides.

<details open><summary>LeGallienne</summary>

Once in the tavern you have reached the end,

Nothing to pray for—nothing to pretend.

<details open><summary>Verse</summary>

<details open><summary>LeGallienne</summary>

Art thou aweary, friend, in all thy bones?  
Drink wine, red wine, and so forget thy groans;  
Wine is unlawful, sayst thou? then say I—  
Who loves not wine had best, I think, eat stones.  
</details>

<details open><summary>Verse</summary>

<details open><summary>LeGallienne</summary>

Think not that I have never tried your way

<details open><summary>Verse</summary>

<details open><summary>LeGallienne</summary>

I cannot help it—were it in my power,  
I would forsake my sins this very hour,  
Forsake the Rose, and bid the Vine good-bye,  
Kiss my last kiss—if it were in my power.  
</details>
</details>

<details open><summary>Verse</summary>

<details open><summary>LeGallienne</summary>

O good old friends, what is it I have said?  
It was the wine that got into my head—  
Forgive me, O forgive, I meant it not,  
I shall forsake you only when I'm dead.  
</details>

<details open><summary>Verse</summary>

<details open><summary>LeGallienne</summary>

Our little women to our bosoms strain.

This is no way my learnèd life to use!  
Tell me a better, then, that I may choose.  
Shall I for some remote imagined gain  
My precious little hour of living lose?

<details open><summary>Verse</summary>

<details open><summary>LeGallienne</summary>

A book, a woman, and a flask of wine:  
The three make heaven for me; it may be thine

But then, I never said thy heaven was mine.

Glad that I came—not sorry to depart.
