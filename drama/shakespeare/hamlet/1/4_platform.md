ACT I SCENE IV 	The platform.	   
[Enter HAMLET, HORATIO, and MARCELLUS]  
HAMLET	The air bites shrewdly; it is very cold.  
HORATIO	It is a nipping and an eager air.  
HAMLET	What hour now?  
HORATIO	I think it lacks of twelve.  
HAMLET	No, it is struck.  
HORATIO	Indeed? I heard it not:  
then it draws near the season  
wherein the spirit held his wont to walk.  

[A flourish of trumpets, and ordnance shot off, within]  
What does this mean, my lord?  
HAMLET	The king doth wake to-night and takes his rouse,  
Keeps wassail+++(=revelry)+++, and the swaggering up-spring reels;  

And, as he drains his draughts of Rhenish down,	10  
the kettle-drum and trumpet thus bray out  
the triumph of his pledge.  
HORATIO	Is it a custom?  
HAMLET	Ay, marry+++(=Mary)+++, is't:  
But to my mind, though I am native here  
and to the manner born, it is a custom more honour'd in the breach than the observance.+++(5)+++  
This heavy-headed revel east and west  
makes us traduced and tax'd of other nations:  
They clepe+++(=call)+++ us drunkards, and with swinish phrase soil our addition;  
and indeed it takes	20 from our achievements, though perform'd at height,  
the pith and marrow of our attribute.  

So, oft it chances in particular men,  
that for some vicious mole of nature in them,  
as, in their birth--  
wherein they are not guilty, since nature cannot choose his origin--  
by the o'ergrowth of some complexion,  
oft breaking down the pales and forts of reason,  
or by some habit that too much o'er-leavens  
the form of +++(ap)+++plausive manners,  
that these men,	30 carrying, I say, the stamp of one defect, being nature's livery, or fortune's star,--  
their virtues else--be they as pure as grace, as infinite as man may undergo--  
shall in the general censure take corruption from that particular fault:  
the dram+++(=drum??)+++ of eale+++(=mythic animal used in heraldry)+++ doth all the noble substance of a doubt to his own scandal+++(←verb)+++.  

HORATIO	Look, my lord, it comes!  
[Enter Ghost]  
HAMLET	Angels and ministers of grace defend us!  

Be thou a spirit of health or goblin damn'd,	40  
bring with thee airs from heaven or blasts from hell,  
be thy intents wicked or charitable,  
thou comest in such a questionable shape  
that I will speak to thee:  
I'll call thee - Hamlet, King, father, royal Dane:  
O, answer me!  
Let me not burst in ignorance;  
but tell why thy canonized bones, hearsed in death, have burst their cerements+++(=burial garments)+++;  
why the sepulchre, wherein we saw thee quietly inurn'd, hath oped his ponderous and marble jaws,	50  
to cast thee up again.  
What may this mean, that thou,  
dead corse, again in complete steel  
revisit'st thus the glimpses of the moon,  
making night hideous; and we fools of nature,  
so horridly to shake our disposition  
with thoughts beyond the reaches of our souls?  
Say, why is this? wherefore? what should we do?  

[Ghost beckons HAMLET]  
HORATIO	It beckons you to go away with it,  
As if it some impartment did desire to you alone.  
MARCELLUS	Look, with what courteous action	60 -  
it waves you to a more removed ground:  
But do not go with it.  
HORATIO	No, by no means.  
HAMLET	It will not speak; then I will follow it.  
HORATIO	Do not, my lord.  
HAMLET	Why, what should be the fear?  
I do not set my life in a pin's fee;  
And for my soul, what can it do to that,  
Being a thing immortal as itself? +++(5)+++  
It waves me forth again: I'll follow it.  

HORATIO	What if it tempt you toward the flood, my lord,  
or to the dreadful summit of the cliff	70 that beetles o'er his base into the sea,  
And there assume some other horrible form,  
which might deprive your sovereignty of reason and draw you into madness?  
think of it:  
The very place puts toys of desperation,  
without more motive, into every brain  
that looks so many fathoms to the sea and hears it roar beneath.  

HAMLET	It waves me still.  
Go on; I'll follow thee.  
MARCELLUS	You shall not go, my lord.  
HAMLET	Hold off your hands.	80  
HORATIO	Be ruled; you shall not go.  
HAMLET	My fate cries out,  
and makes each petty artery in this body  
as hardy as the +++(Hercules-famed)+++ Nemean lion's nerve.  
Still am I call'd.  
Unhand me, gentlemen.+++(5)+++  
By heaven, I'll make a ghost of him that lets+++(→laets = slows)+++ me!  
I say, away! Go on; I'll follow thee.  

[Exeunt Ghost and HAMLET]  
HORATIO	He waxes desperate with imagination.  
MARCELLUS	Let's follow; 'tis not fit thus to obey him.  
HORATIO	Have after. To what issue will this come?  
MARCELLUS	Something is rotten in the state of Denmark.	90+++(5)+++  
HORATIO	Heaven will direct it.  
MARCELLUS	Nay, let's follow him.  
[Exeunt]
